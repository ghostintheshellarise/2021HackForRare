"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple colonic polyps, is caused by a germline pathogenic variant of the APC gene. However, this variant is not detected in up to 30% of patients with the adenomatous polyposis phenotype. METHODS: We performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify the causative genes in FAP patients with 10 or more polyps. For patients in whom the APC germline variant was not able to be identified, we screened for APC mosaicism using high-coverage NGS of APC with DNA from leucocytes and/or frozen tissue. RESULTS: The pathogenic APC germline variant was found in 93.3%, 71.6%, and 17.1% of patients with profuse-type polyposis, sparse-type polyposis, and oligo-polyposis, respectively. The APC germline variant detection rate in patients with FAP-related diseases was 69.7% for fundic gland polyposis, 79.7% for duodenal adenoma, 94.7% for desmoid tumor, and 71.4% for thyroid cancer, with increasing numbers of extracolonic lesions associated with an increasing APC germline variant detection rate. A mosaic test detected nine patients with APC mosaicism. A comparison of APC-associated polyposis with APC mosaicism showed that patients with APC mosaicism had a low frequency of duodenal adenoma and a family history of colonic polyposis. CONCLUSIONS: We determined the detection rate of the APC germline variant by phenotype and identified APC mosaicism. Genetic testing of FAP patients is important because it can help with surgical decision-making, monitoring, and genetic counseling. Furthermore, genetic testing by NGS proved to be an effective method of detecting APC germline variants."
"gastric DF followed by cecal DF with two years of clinical interval. The latter tumor (cecal DF) developed under scheduled postoperative surveillance of laparoscopic gastrectomy. Although a surgical wound is known to be an inductive factor for DFs, the cecal DF developed in a part that was not a surgical site in the previous operation. Curative resection is the first treatment option when the tumor shows progression in size. Following the curative resection, close observation should be provided because of the risk of locoregional recurrence."
"We aimed to investigate changes in volume and MRI T2-weighted intensity in desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) receiving methotrexate plus vinca-alkaloids (MTX-VA) at Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan. METHODS: All cases of sporadic DF treated with MTX-VA from 1999 to 2019 were reviewed. MRIs at baseline, 6 and 12 months of chemotherapy and at treatment withdrawal were retrospectively reviewed, contouring the tumor lesion and measuring diameters, volume, and mean T2-signal intensity (normalized to muscle) changes. These parameters were also evaluated according to clinical variables. RESULTS: Thirty-two DF patients were identified. Best RECIST response was: 25% partial response, 69% stable disease, 6% progression. A >/=65% tumor volume reduction was observed in 38%, <65% reduction in 53%, an increase in 9%. 22% had RECIST stable disease with a >/=65% tumor volume reduction. T2-signal intensity decreased by >/=50% in 47%, <50% in 41% and increased in 12%. In patients with symptomatic improvement while on therapy and in patients maintaining symptomatic improvement during follow-up, median T2-signal intensity showed a reduction along the time points (3.0, 1.9, 1.2, 1.1; 2.9, 2.0, 1.2, 1.2, respectively); in patients without symptomatic improvement and in those clinically progressing during follow-up, a reduction was not observed. High T2-signal intensity at baseline was observed in patients showing RECIST progression during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In this series, RECIST detected a lower proportion of responses as compared to volumetric and T2-signal changes. T2-signal reduction seemed to better reflect symptomatic improvement. High T2-signal intensity at baseline was related to a higher proportion of further progression."
"Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is an ultra-rare, translocated, vascular sarcoma. EHE clinical behavior is variable, ranging from that of a low-grade malignancy to that of a high-grade sarcoma and it is marked by a high propensity for systemic involvement. No active systemic agents are currently approved specifically for EHE, which is typically refractory to the antitumor drugs used in sarcomas. The degree of uncertainty in selecting the most appropriate therapy for EHE patients and the lack of guidelines on the clinical management of the disease make the adoption of new treatments inconsistent across the world, resulting in suboptimal outcomes for many EHE patients. To address the shortcoming, a global consensus meeting was organized in December 2020 under the umbrella of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) involving >80 experts from several disciplines from Europe, North America and Asia, together with a patient representative from the EHE Group, a global, disease-specific patient advocacy group, and Sarcoma Patient EuroNet (SPAEN). The meeting was aimed at defining, by consensus, evidence-based best practices for the optimal approach to primary and metastatic EHE. The consensus achieved during that meeting is the subject of the present publication."
"To retrospectively determine efficacy and safety of cryoablation in patients with desmoid tumors over a 10-year period at a single institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 25 February 2010 and 25 February 2020, 25 patients (12 - 80 years) with 26 lesions (mean pre-procedural tumor volume was 236.6 cm(3)) were treated over 44 cryoablation procedures. 11 patients were treated as first line therapy. 14 patients had previous medical therapy, radiotherapy and/or surgery. Subsequent clinical follow up, imaging outcomes and safety were analyzed for technical success, change in total lesion volume (TLV) and viable tumor volume (VTV), modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST), progression free survival (PFS) for tumor progression and symptom recurrence, symptom improvement and procedure related complications. Symptomatic improvement was defined as documentation of relief of pain (partial or complete) and/or functional impairment. RESULTS: All procedures were technically successful. At 7 to 12 months, median change in TLV and VTV were -6.7% (p = 0.809) and -43.7% (p = 0.01) respectively. By 10-12 months mRECIST, responses were complete response 0%, partial response 61.5% (8/13), stable disease 30.8% (4/13) and progressive disease 7.7% (1/13). Median PFS for tumor progression and symptom recurrence were not reached, with a median follow up of 15.3 months and 21.0 months respectively. Symptomatic relief (partial or complete) was achieved in 96.9% (32/33) of patients. There was 1 major complication (2.4%). CONCLUSION: In this retrospectively identified cohort, cryoablation is effective and safe for local control of extra-abdominal desmoid tumors in short term follow up."
"A 49-year-old woman presented to surgery outpatient clinic with the awareness of a right lower abdomen asymptomatic lump for one week. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen demonstrated a 10x11x15 cm heterogeneous lesion anterior to the ileocecal junction with the possibility of leiomyosarcoma. The patient was prepared for laparotomy and intraoperative there was a large tumour arising from the medial wall of cecum. Right haemicolectomy was performed, and histopathology came as a desmoid tumour of the cecum. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and is well on 1-year follow-up."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is a borderline tumor of soft tissues that has low malignant potential but described as infiltrative, locally aggressive and rapidly growing. In the pediatric population, it occurs in the head and neck. Presentation varies based on tumor size and location. Despite the high recurrence rate, surgical excision remains the modality of choice with. Here, we report a case of a 5-month-old boy, with extensive head and neck DF that was managed twice with conservative debulking surgery through a combined transoral-transcervical approach. On 2-year follow-up, he was gaining weight with no developmental delay and had no clinical evidence tumor regrowth."
"A 23-year-old Korean female presented epigastric pain of two-months' duration. She had a laparoscopic ovarian cyst excision 8 months previously. Clinical examination was normal. An abdominal computed tomogram (CT) demonstrated a 10-cm solid mass in the distal pancreas, with signs of splenic artery and vein occlusion, gastric and transverse colon invasion. Operative findings showed a mass involving distal pancreas, invasive to the posterior wall of the antrum of the stomach and transverse colon and 4th portion of the duodenum without lymph node involvement. The surgery consisted of a distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy and combined partial resection of the stomach, transverse colon and 4th portion of the duodenum. The immunohistochemistry and histopathological features were consistent with a confirmed diagnosis of intra-abdominal desmoid type fibromatosis (DTF). The prognosis of pancreatic DTF is not known and she showed no recurrence or distant metastasis during a 3 year follow-up. Herein we report a rare case with an isolated, sporadic, and non-trauma-related DTF, located at the pancreatic body and tail."
"Extra abdominal desmoid tumors are rare, highly aggressive, and invasive benign soft tissue tumors. Current treatment modalities show high levels of recurrence and comorbidities. Cryo-surgery as an alternative was subsequently investigated. METHODS: In this retrospective, single center study 11 patients showing symptomatic tumors were treated with individualized cryo-surgery. Treatment protocol included preoperative planning using computer rendered 3D models, intraoperative navigation and execution using cone beam guidance, and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging image analysis using a gaussian mixture model software. Subjective outcomes were reported using Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaires. RESULTS: Sixteen ablations were performed, each demonstrating a complete match with the determined preoperative plan and model. A total of 9/11 (82%) of patients showed improvements in symptoms and a reduction in tumor volume while 2/11 (18%) did not. Average reduction in tumor volume and viable segments were 36.7% (p = 0.0397) and 63.3% (p = 0.0477), respectively. Mild complications according to the SIR Adverse Event Classification Guidelines were experienced in 3/16 (19%) ablations. SF-36 scores showed a statistically significant improvement (p = 0.0194) in the mental health category and a nonsignificant (p = 0.8071) improvement in the physical health category. CONCLUSION: Cryo-surgery using the three-phase protocol as described may improve the overall outcome of future ablation procedures."
"Desmoid tumors (DT) are rare non-metastatic neoplasms that occur through myofibroblast proliferation in musculoaponeurotic or fascial structures of the body, being commonly diagnosed in young women during pregnancy or in the post-partum period. We present the case of a 38-year-old woman, who recently gave birth, manifesting non-specific abdominal symptoms. Computed tomography indicated the presence of a solitary tumor arising from the intestinal wall or from the mesentery. Surgery confirmed the diagnosis, revealing a tumor that was localized at the level of the jejunal mesentery, having about 7 cm in diameter, in tight contact with the duodenum and the mesenteric vessels. ""En bloc"" resection of the tumor was performed, together with the involved enteral loops followed by end-to-end anastomosis of the jejunum. Histopathological examination of the surgical specimen sustained the diagnosis of desmoid tumor."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) is a rare locally aggressive soft tissue neoplasm without metastatic potential. Here, we report a very rare sporadic case of an intracranial supratentorial extradural DTF measuring 82 mm in a 1-year-old girl, that recurred twice following surgery over the course of 16 months, requiring two other surgeries. In three surgeries, we resected a huge tumor with the dura which was thought to be tumor origin and removed this tumor infiltrated the frontal skull base by drilling widely. Furthermore, we treated the tumor invading the bone flap using liquid nitrogen for 20 minutes, and subsequently used it to perform a cranioplasty. This tumor has not recurred for past 8 months. DTF invading the skull base is prone to recurrence, and liquid nitrogen treatment is considered to be effective in pediatric patients, who need cranioplasty with tumor-infiltrating autologous bone flaps."
"Desmoid fibromatosis (DF) is a locally aggressive, not metastasizing tumor associated with high local recurrence rates. Surgery was a standard-of-care for DF treatment; however, recently, conservative treatment and active surveillance are preferred. This study aimed to evaluate the real-life outcomes of DF treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All consecutive patients diagnosed with DF and treated between 01.1999 and 12.2018 at one sarcoma reference institution were included in this retrospective analysis. Kaplan-Meier estimator, long-rank test, Cox regression model, and Chi2 tests were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: The analyses included 363 patients (254 female, 109 male). 195 patients (53.7%) underwent surgical resection, and 139 (38.3%) experienced a watch-and-wait approach with or without concomitant therapy with nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the first line. Disease recurrence/progression occurred in 43.2% of patients treated with surgery and 42.6% in the watch-and-wait group, resulting in 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rates of 60% and 55%, respectively. There was no difference in EFS between both groups (HR1.28, 95%CI 0.91-1.79). Surgery without prior biopsy and extra-abdominal wall location was associated with inferior outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Results of DF treatment in our center showed that watch-and-wait approach +/- NSAIDs has similar efficacy to upfront surgery and allows to avoid unnecessary surgery in approximately half of the patients, primarily when tumors are located in unfavorable sites, like extremities."
"Fibromatoses encompass a broad group of histopathologically similar fibroblastic/myofibroblastic proliferations with divergent clinical manifestations and behavior. Deep (desmoid-type) fibromatoses are typically large, rapidly growing, and locally aggressive tumors that occur in the abdominal wall, mesentery, and extraabdominal soft tissue, principally the musculature of the trunk and extremities. Most sporadic cases of desmoid fibromatosis harbor inactivating mutations in CTNNB1, the gene encoding beta-catenin. Tumors occurring in the context of familial adenomatous polyposis and Gardner syndrome bear inactivating mutations in APC. By contrast, mutations in CTNNB1 or APC have not been identified in cases of superficial fibromatosis. Cutaneous involvement by desmoid fibromatosis is exceedingly rare. Here we present a 78-year-old male with desmoid-type fibromatosis arising in the dermis of the right medial calf with a pathogenic mutation in CTNNB1 and a variant of unknown significance in APC.

"Desmoid-type fibromatosis, a rare locally aggressive fibroblastic proliferation, is a treatment challenge. This review aimed to explore recent data about the management of desmoid-type fibromatosis. RECENT FINDINGS: New data underline the role of kinases and -secretase in stimulating cell proliferation and invasiveness in desmoid-type fibromatosis. This explains the proven activity of multikinase inhibitors (sorafenib or pazopanib) in the management of desmoid-type fibromatosis or the emerging role of a -secretase inhibitor. An international guideline for management was recently published, and this guideline take into account patient point of view. Lastly, recent studies highlight the multidimensional burden of desmoid-type fibromatosis, particularly health-related quality of life (HRQoL). SUMMARY: Active surveillance with planned MRI is the first-line management in desmoid-type fibromatosis. A site-specific and stepwise approach should be considered for progressive desmoid-type fibromatosis. Further, a risk-benefit analysis that considers the side effects and long-term sequelae should be conducted before deciding to start any treatment. A less aggressive approach should be considered. Multikinase inhibitors are effective, but their tolerability and side effects should be discussed with the patients. The symptoms and HRQoL should be integrated in decision-making. Desmoid-type fibromatosis patients should be offered support to address their needs supportive care."

"Sorafenib, an oral chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of solid tumors, is associated with a variety of adverse cutaneous drug reactions in up to 90% of patients. Infrequently, delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions such as erythema multiforme occur. This case describes a child treated with sorafenib for a retrosternal desmoid tumor who developed widespread erythema multiforme across his extremities, trunk, face, and mucosal membranes."
"VGLL2-rearranged rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS) are rare low-grade tumors with only favorable outcomes reported to date. We describe 4 patients with VGLL2-rearranged RMS confirmed by molecular studies, who experienced local progression and distant metastases, including 2 with fatal outcomes. Tumors were diagnosed at birth (n=3) or at 12 months of age (n=1), and were all localized at initial diagnosis, but unresectable and therefore managed with chemotherapy and surveillance. Metastatic progression occurred from 1 to 8 years from diagnosis (median, 3.5 y). Three patients experienced multimetastatic spread and one showed an isolated adrenal metastasis. At initial diagnosis, 3 tumors displaying bland morphology were misdiagnosed as fibromatosis or infantile fibrosarcoma and initially managed as such, while 1 was a high-grade sarcoma. At relapse, 3 tumors showed high-grade morphology, while 1 retained a low-grade phenotype. Low-grade primary tumors showed only very focal positivity for desmin, myogenin, and/or MyoD1, while high-grade tumors were heterogenously or diffusely positive. Whole-exome sequencing, performed on primary and relapse samples for 3 patients, showed increased genomic instability and additional genomic alterations (eg, TP53, CDKN2A/B, FGFR4) at relapse, but no recurrent events. RNA sequencing confirmed that high-grade tumors retained VGLL2 fusion transcripts and transcriptomic profiles consistent with VGLL2-rearranged RMS. High-grade samples showed a high expression of genes encoding cell cycle proteins, desmin, and some developmental factors. These 4 cases with distinct medical history imply the importance of complete surgical resection, and suggest that RMS-type chemotherapy should be considered in unresectable cases, given the risk of high-grade transformation. They also emphasize the importance of correct initial diagnosis."
"To demonstrate the feasibility of percutaneous microwave ablation in desmoid fibromatosis with respect to tumor volume control and improvement in the quality of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve microwave ablations were performed in 9 patients with a histological diagnosis of desmoid fibromatosis between January 2010 and January 2019. The study population included 6 female and 3 male, with an age range of 21-76 years (mean = 46.6 years; standard deviation [SD] = 19.3 years). The mean major axis of the tumors was 10.9 cm (SD = 5.2 cm) and mean lesion volume was 212.7 cm(3) (SD = 213 cm(3)). Their anatomical distribution was as follows: 3 lesions in the thigh, 2 in the gluteus, 2 in the leg and 2 in the periscapular region. We evaluated the reduction in tumor volume and improvement in the quality of life based on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale. RESULTS: An average tumor volume reduction of 70.4% (SD = 24.9) was achieved, while the quality of life (ECOG scale) improved in 88.9% of patients. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous microwave ablation may potentially be a safe, effective, and promising technique for controlling tumor volume and improving the quality of life in patients with desmoid fibromatosis."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is a locally aggressive neoplasm characterized by mutations in the CTNNB1 gene, which encodes the beta-catenin protein. We reviewed 85 cases of DF and performed Sanger sequencing for detecting mutations in CTNNB1 and immunostaining for detecting beta-catenin localization. We included 70 DF samples, of which 56 cases demonstrated nuclear beta-catenin localization and 43 cases harboured CTNNB1 mutations. CTNNB1-mutant DF samples consistently displayed nuclear beta-catenin expression and were derived from larger-sized tumours compared to samples with wild-type CTNNB1. When we further classified DF cases into 2 subgroups based on the type of specimen, excised specimens with nuclear beta-catenin expression frequently displayed CTNNB1 mutation and no statistical correlation between nuclear beta-catenin expression and CTNNB1 mutation was observed in biopsies. When we classified CTNNB1 mutation cases into 2 subgroups (DF with T41A or T41I, and DF with S45F or S45P), T41A or T41I mutations were observed more frequently in males than in females. Additionally, DF tumours harbouring S45F or S45P mutations were located more frequently in the abdominal wall than tumours with T41A or T41I mutations. In conclusion, CTNNB1 mutation correlates with nuclear beta-catenin expression in larger or excised DF tumours, and DF harbouring CTNNB1 mutations manifest variable clinical presentations."
"To compare absolute volume (AV) assessment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) for the response evaluation of desmoid tumors (DTs) treated with radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients with DTs >/=3 cm in size were included. RESULTS: The median follow-up duration was 78.0 months. Five patients achieved a complete response according to RECIST, seven reached a partial response (PR), and one eventually exhibited progression. The overall response rate was 61%, the median time to PR was 8.0 months. Six patients achieved stable disease, although three developed progressions. Of the six patients with a PR, the median change in maximum diameter was -46%, and the median change in maximum volume was -84%. Three patients could have been diagnosed with progression at least 6 months earlier if the AV increment was considered. CONCLUSION: An AV assessment is essential for an accurate response assessment of DTs and radiotherapy seems feasible as a first-line treatment for DTs."
"The diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is challenging because of its potential overlap with other neoplasms or even with reactive conditions. Recently, DNA methylation analysis was reported as effective in the diagnosis of tumors. In the present study, this approach was tested for use in the diagnosis of MPM. The DNA methylation patterns of a discovery cohort and an independent-validation cohort of MPMs were compared to those of 202 cases representing malignant and benign diagnostic mimics (angiosarcoma, desmoid-type fibromatosis, epithelioid sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, nodular fasciitis, reactive mesothelial hyperplasia, sclerosing fibrous pleuritis, solitary fibrous tumor, and synovial sarcoma). By both unsupervised hierarchical clustering and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding analysis, MPM samples in the discovery cohort exhibited a DNA methylation profile different from those of other neoplastic and reactive mimics. These results were confirmed in the independent-validation cohort and by in silico analysis of the MPM-The Cancer Genome Atlas data set. Copy number-variation profiles were also inferred to identify molecular hallmarks of MPM, including CDKN2A and NF2 deletions. Methylation profiling was effective in the diagnosis of MPM, although caution is advised in samples with low tumor cell content."
"Extra-abdominal desmoid tumor fibromatosis (DTF) is a rare, locally aggressive soft tissue tumour. The best treatment modality for this patient cohort is still object of debate. QUESTIONS/PURPOSE: This paper aimed to (1) to compare the outcomes of DTF after different treatment modalities, (2) to assess prognostic factors for recurrence following surgical excision, and (3) to assess prognostic factors for progression during observation. METHODS: This was a retrospective multicenter study under the patronage of the European Musculoskeletal Oncology Society (EMSOS). All seven centres involved were tertiary referral centres for soft tissue tumours. Baseline demographic data was collected for all patients as well as data on the diagnosis, tumour characteristics, clinical features, treatment modalities and whether they had any predisposing factors for DTF. RESULTS: Three hundred eighty-eight patients (240 female, 140 male) with a mean age of 37.6 (+/-18.8 SD, range: 3-85) were included in the study. Two hundred fifty-seven patients (66%) underwent surgical excision of ADF, 70 patients (18%) were observed without therapy, the residual patients had different conservative treatments. There were no significant differences in terms of tumour recurrence or progression between the different treatment groups. After surgical excision, younger age, recurrent disease and larger tumour size were risk factors for recurrence, while tumours around the shoulder girdle and painful lesions were at risk of progression in the observational group. CONCLUSION: Local recurrence rate after surgery was similar to progression rates under observation. Hence, observation in DTF seems to be justified, considering surgery in case of dimensional progression in 2 consecutive controls (3 and 6 months) and in painful lesions, with particular attention to lesions around the shoulder girdle."
"Desmoid type fibromatosis of the breast is a rare stromal tumor that accounts for <0.2% of all breast tumors. Bilateral and multicentric lesions are extremely rare, with only less than ten cases reported in the literature. Although benign, it is locally aggressive with frequent recurrence in up to almost one-third of the cases. We experienced our first case of bilateral multicentric breast fibromatosis in a 19-year-old woman, with a paternal aunt diagnosed with breast cancer at age 30, who presented to our institution with the chief complaint of retracted nipples for 1 year. The patient denied any history of trauma to her chest. Sonography showed suspicious bilateral hypoechoic masses. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed for further evaluation because of the extensive involvement of both the breasts. This report aimed to illustrate the main clinical, radiological, and histopathological characteristics of this rare disease to increase awareness of this entity and discuss the role of MRI."
"Diarrhea is a common condition seen among soldiers in both garrison and deployed environments. Although the vast majority of soldiers with diarrhea will recover uneventfully with supportive care, clinicians should also maintain suspicion for less common causes and perform a thorough physical exam. We report the case of a young, healthy soldier with chronic diarrhea and progressively worsening abdominal distention that began during his deployment to Honduras who was subsequently found to have a large intra-abdominal desmoid tumor. Desmoid tumor is a rare and benign neoplasm that typically appears on the extremity, abdominal wall, intra-abdominal space, and occasionally in the chest wall. This tumor may be associated with abdominal distension and gastrointestinal complaints. A large tumor can compress organs, causing local tissue damage and, in rare cases, death."
"To investigate the efficiency of pre-therapy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features in predicting the prognosis of desmoid-type fibromatosis patients treated with imatinib. Materials and Methods: A total of 38 desmoid-type fibromatosis patients treated with imatinib were collected in this retrospective study. The high signal intensity on pre-therapy MRI was evaluated on axial T2 and T1 contrast-enhanced sequences with fat suppression. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses explored the correlation between clinical or radiographic characteristics and progression-free survival (PFS). Results: Hyperintense T1 contrast enhancement (CE) proportion (>/= 75%) was identified as an independent predictor for PFS. Patients with hyperintense T1 CE proportion <75% demonstrated no progression, while patients with hyperintense T1 CE proportion >/=75% demonstrated a progression rate of 78.4%. Conclusion: Hyperintense T1 CE proportion in the tumor is a potential predictor of disease progression in patients with desmoid-type fibromatosis treated with imatinib. Hyperintense T1 CE proportion <75% indicates progression-free during treatment."
"Fibromatosis or desmoid fibromatosis is a rare benign neoplasm and develops commonly in the abdominal wall, abdominal cavity, or extra-abdominal sites. The mainstay of treatment is surgery. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are preferred in cases of inoperable/relapse or a multifocal disease. Hereby, we report a case of fibromatosis arising in the left popliteal fossa, proven by histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Local excision of the mass was performed. The patient was asymptomatic for 6 months, after which she complained of difficulty in walking. Clinical evaluation elicited recurrence in the surgical bed. In spite of the surgical excision with tumor-free margins, recurrence was seen within a span of 6 months. (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) was done to rule out multifocal disease and to define the extent of relapse. Although magnetic resonance imaging provides an excellent soft-tissue resolution to delineate the disease, (18)F-FDG PET/CT is an important and supplementary tool which aids in the management of fibromatosis."
"Desmoplastic fibroblastoma is an uncommon, benign, fibrous tumor exhibiting infiltrative growth. Most of these tumors are small, slow-growing, and develop as subcutaneous lesions in the extremities. Cases of desmoplastic fibroblastoma in the chest wall are quite rare, and the preoperative diagnosis of such cases remains challenging as these tumors can mimic the characteristics of desmoid-type fibromatosis, which often occurs in the chest wall. We aimed to describe a rare case of desmoplastic fibroblastoma exhibiting rapid growth in the chest wall of a patient that was successfully treated with marginal excision only by diagnostic imaging before surgery. CASE PRESENTATION: A 79-year-old man was admitted to our hospital after experiencing right shoulder pain lasting for a few months. A 4 x 4 x 2 cm mass was incidentally detected at the right second rib two years prior. Chest computed tomography revealed a well-defined homogeneous mass with a muscle-like density along the right lateral chest wall, the size of which had increased to 12 x 10 x 4.5 cm in two years. Dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed abundant vascularity at the periphery of the tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed iso-intensity to muscle on T1-weighted images, slightly high intensity on T2-weighted images, and rim-like contrast enhancement at the periphery of the tumor, with uniform thickness on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images with fat suppression. Rim-like contrast enhancement is an imaging feature that can distinguish cases of desmoplastic fibroblastoma from desmoid-type fibromatosis. We diagnosed the tumor as desmoplastic fibroblastoma by diagnostic imaging without tissue biopsy. Marginal excision with videoscopic assistance was performed through a small incision. The pathological diagnosis was desmoplastic fibroblastoma. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and his shoulder pain was relieved after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Desmoplastic fibroblastoma in the chest wall is extremely rare, but should be considered in the differential diagnosis when desmoid-type fibromatosis is clinically suspected. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is helpful in confirming the differential diagnosis."
"This case report describes the history of a 41 year-old woman with a solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) of the pancreas and a metachronous abdominal desmoid tumor (DT) that occurred two years after the SPN surgical resection. At next-generation sequencing of 174 cancer-related genes, both neoplasms harbored a CTNNB1 somatic mutation which was different in each tumor. Moreover, two BRCA2 pathogenic mutations were found in both tumors, confirmed as germline by the sequencing of normal tissue. The BRCA2 mutations were c.631G>A, resulting in the amino-acid change p.V211I, and c.7008-2A>T, causing a splice acceptor site loss. However, as the two neoplasms showed neither loss of heterozygosity nor somatic mutation in the second BRCA2 allele, they cannot be considered as BRCA-dependent tumors. Nevertheless, this study highlights the important opportunities opened by extensive tumor molecular profiling. In this particular case, it permitted the detection of BRCA2-germline mutations, essential for addressing the necessary BRCA-related genetic counseling, surveillance, and screening for the patient and her family."
"A 70-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with acute abdominal pain. Abdominal CT showed a 6-cm-sized tumor near the third portion of the duodenum, and a duodenal GIST was suspected. Although the abdominal pain was intense and the tumor was suspected to be ruptured, the vital signs were stable; therefore, we initially planned to perform an elective surgery. However, because the pain could not be controlled, the surgery was performed on the 6th day of hospitalization. The tumor appeared to be a duodenal GIST because it was pulling the third portion of the duodenum inwards. It had a strong tendency to infiltrate the surrounding organs; therefore, forced resection of the right colon, which is the surrounding organ, was performed. Pathological findings showed that the resected specimen was a desmoid tumor and the surgical margins were negative. The postoperative course 1 year after surgery was favorable, and no tumor recurrence occurred. We report a case of desmoid tumor, which caused acute abdominal pain."

"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is a locally aggressive but non-metastatic (myo)fibroblastic neoplasm. A hallmark of the tumor is nuclear positivity for beta-catenin in immunohistochemistry due mostly to CTNNB1 mutations. However, a recent study has reported that even beta-catenin 'nuclear-negative' DFs can harbor CTNNB1 mutations and that the positive ratio of nuclear beta-catenin in DF is different among antibodies. Here, we reviewed soft tissue lesions for which the possibility of DF was considered and compared the sensitivity and specificity of nuclear beta-catenin for the diagnosis of DF among commonly used anti-beta-catenin antibodies, i.e., clone beta-catenin 1, 17C2 and 14. We analyzed 26 cases of DF, 28 cases of benign fibroblastic lesions, and 27 cases of other soft tissue tumors. The sensitivity and specificity of nuclear beta-catenin for the diagnosis of DF were different among antibodies; 54% and 98% in clone beta-catenin 1, 85% and 84% in 17C2, and 96% and 62% in 14. IHC of LEF1 showed comparable results with IHC of beta-catenin, with a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 76%. Additionally, when beta-catenin 1 was used, DFs showed characteristic dotted cytoplasmic staining, often appearing as rings. Our results might be helpful for making a correct diagnosis of DF."
"Gardner syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder with a high degree of penetrance, which is characterized by intestinal polyposis, osteomas, and dental abnormalities. Majority of patients with Gardner syndrome will develop colorectal cancer by the age of 40 to 50 years. Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene are supposed to be responsible for the initiation of Gardner syndrome. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 22-year-old Chinese female was admitted to our hospital due to abdominal pain and bloody stool. DIAGNOSIS: The patient presented with multiple intestinal polyposis, desmoid tumors, and dental abnormalities was diagnosed as Gardner syndrome and further examination revealed a colon tumor. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: Patients were implanted with stents to alleviate bowel obstruction, and were treated with oxaliplatin combined with 5-Fu for 4 cycles, but the efficacy was not good. We performed next generation sequencing of 390 genes for the tumor specimens. We detected adenomatous polyposis coli E1538Ifs *5, KRAS G12D, NF1 R652C, loss of SMAD4, TP53 R175H, IRF2 p.R82S, TCF7L2 p.A418Tfs *14, and SMAD4 p.L43F in this patient. LESSONS: We reported serial mutations in key genes responsible for initiation and progression of colorectal cancer from a patient with Gardner syndrome."
"4.58, 95% CI 1.06 to 19.78) and APC mutation 3' of codon 1309 (OR: 13.07, 95% CI 3.58 to 47.56) and also 3' of codon 1444 (OR: 8.0, 95% CI 1.83 to 34.94). Global cooperation is required to establish FAP genotype-phenotype associations and population-specific risk estimates to guide genetic counselling and risk management."
"There are no clearly defined indications for pancreas-preserving duodenectomy. The present study aimed to analyze postoperative morbidity and the outcomes of patients undergoing pancreas-preserving duodenectomy. METHODS: Patients undergoing pancreas-preserving duodenectomy from April 2008 to May 2020 were included. We divided the series according to indication: scenario 1, primary duodenal tumors; scenario 2, tumors of another origin with duodenal involvement; and scenario 3, emergency duodenectomy. RESULTS: We included 35 patients. Total duodenectomy was performed in 1 patient of adenomatous duodenal polyposis, limited duodenectomy in 7, and third + fourth duodenal portion resection in 27. The indications for scenario 1 were gastrointestinal stromal tumor (n = 13), adenocarcinoma (n = 4), neuroendocrine tumor (n = 3), duodenal adenoma (n = 1), and adenomatous duodenal polyposis (n = 1); scenario 2: retroperitoneal desmoid tumor (n = 2), recurrence of liposarcoma (n = 2), retroperitoneal paraganglioma (n = 1), neuroendocrine tumor in pancreatic uncinate process (n = 1), and duodenal infiltration due to metastatic adenopathies of a germinal tumor with digestive hemorrhage (n = 1); and scenario 3: aortoenteric fistula (n = 3), duodenal trauma (n = 1), erosive duodenitis (n = 1), and biliopancreatic limb ischemia (n = 1). Severe complications (Clavien-Dindo >/= IIIb) developed in 14% (5/35), and postoperative mortality was 3% (1/35). CONCLUSIONS: Pancreas-preserving duodenectomy is useful in the management of primary duodenal tumors, and is a technical option for some tumors with duodenal infiltration or in emergency interventions."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a rare type of intra-abdominal desmoid tumour that usually involves the small bowel mesentery. It is a locally-invasive lesion, with a high rate of recurrence, but without metastatic potential. Aggressive fibromatosis is seen more often in young female patients. This case report presents the radiological, intraoperative and histopathological findings from a 37-year-old female patient that presented with epigastric pain and a palpable mass in the right hemiabdomen. Histological and immunohistochemical examinations of the resected tumour, including positive staining for beta-catenin, confirmed a postoperative diagnosis of desmoid type fibromatosis. This specific case showed that desmoid type fibromatosis of the colon can mimic gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) based on its clinical presentation, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings. Differential diagnosis between desmoid type fibromatosis and GIST is clinically very important due to the different treatments and follow-up protocols that are implemented for these lesions."
"Desmoid tumor is a very rare neoplasm which develops from fibroblasts. These tumors do not have the ability to metastasize, but they can cause significant morbidity and mortality by local invasion and they are prone to local recurrence. We present a case of an aggressive fibromatosis in a 28-year-old male patient with no previous medical history. The tumor was in the retroperitoneum and eventually caused perforation of the coecum. During the operation, no metastasis was found; however, local lymphadenopathy was seen. After the surgical resection, no adjuvant therapy (radio or chemotherapy) was given to the patient and on follow-up (after three years), no recurrence was observed."
"Desmoid tumor is considered a benign neoplasm, yet substantial morbidity can result from local invasion of structures adjacent to the tumor or from complications related to its treatment. We report two patients with extremity desmoid tumor who were each found at MRI to have an unsuspected pseudoaneurysm within their tumor after prior treatments (surgery and systemic therapy in one, surgery alone in the other). Such a pseudoaneurysm probably results from weakening of an arterial wall by adjacent desmoid tumor, as well as from local trauma. Due to the potential risk for life-threatening rupture of a pseudoaneurysm, one patient underwent surgical repair and the other, coil embolization. To our knowledge the presence of pseudoaneurysm has been reported within a few cases of abdominal desmoid tumor but not within an extremity desmoid tumor. This diagnosis has not been reported to have been made at MRI, either."
"Desmoid fibromatosis (DF) is a locally aggressive clonal neoplasm with locally aggressive behavior and no metastatic potential. Historical treatment of DF has consisted primarily of up-front surgery when feasible. In recent years, recognition that DF can spontaneously stabilize or involute has allowed for many patients to be managed with watchful waiting rather than intervention. This review is intended to review recent developments in the treatment of DF. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have demonstrated prospectively that patients with DF often have improvement in their lesions without intervention, enabling an initial period of surveillance as a standard option for patients with mild symptoms. Given the lengthening list of effective systemic treatments, including sorafenib, pazopanib, and experimental agents, there has been a less reliance on local therapies for those patients who require treatment. For patients with DF that require treatment, there is a growing list of options that includes radiation therapy (RT), percutaneous ablation, and a growing list of systemic agents with favorable toxicity profiles."
"Surgery is an important treatment option for desmoid tumor (DT) patients, but how to decrease and predict the high recurrence rate remains a major challenge. Methods: Desmoid tumor patients diagnosed and treated at Tianjin Cancer Institute & Hospital were included, and a web-based nomogram was constructed by screening the recurrence-related risk factors using Cox regression analysis. External validation was conducted with data from the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. Results: A total of 385 patients were identified. Finally, after excluding patients without surgery, patients who were lost to follow-up, and patients without complete resection, a total of 267 patients were included in the nomogram construction. Among these patients, 53 experienced recurrence, with a recurrence rate of 20.15%. The 3-year and 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were 82.5% and 78%, respectively. Age, tumor diameter, admission status, location, and tumor number were correlated with recurrence in univariate Cox analysis. In multivariate Cox analysis, only age, tumor diameter and tumor number were independent risk factors for recurrence and were then used to construct a web-based nomogram to predict recurrence. The concordance index (C-index) of the nomogram was 0.718, and the areas under the curves (AUCs) of the 3-year and 5-year receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were 0.751 and 0.761, respectively. In the external validation set, the C-index was 0.706, and the AUCs of the 3-year and 5-year ROC curves are 0.788 and 0.794, respectively. Conclusions: Age, tumor diameter, and tumor number were independent predictors of recurrence for DTs, and a web-based nomogram containing these three predictors could accurately predict RFS (https://stepforward.shinyapps.io/Desmoidtumor/)."
"To assess efficacy and safety of percutaneous cryoablation (CA) for advanced and refractory extra-abdominal desmoid tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed 30 consecutive patients with symptomatic desmoid tumors evolving after ""wait and watch"" periods, and despite medical treatment, treated by CA between 2007 and 2019. Progression free survival (PFS), objective response rate, pain reduction (decreased of visual analogic scale pain (VAS)[Formula: see text] 3 or disappearance of pain), total volume lesion (TVL) and complications were documented. Kaplan Meier method was used to outline PFS. Paired sample t test was used to compare volume of tumors before treatment and at 1 and 3 year. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 18.5 months (range 6-93 months, interquartile range (IQR): 12-55), the PFS was 85.1% at 1 year and 77.3% at 3 years. Objective response was obtained for 80% of patients with a complete response for 43% patients. Pain reduction was obtained for 96.7% (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 90.3, 100) of patients. Median volume of desmoid tumor before treatment was 124.1cm(3) (range 2-1727cm(3), IQR: 54-338cm(3)). Median change of TLV after ablation was 66.6% (95% CI: 37.2, 72.3; p = 0.002) at 1 year and 76.4% (95% CI: 59.1, 89.8; p = 0.002) at 3 year. Adverse events rate was 36.6%, the most common was edema and temporary increase of pain in the days following CA. Four patients experienced a major complication (13.3%): 2 skin necrosis, 1 infection and 1 brachial plexopathy. CONCLUSION: CA is an effective treatment for advanced and refractory extra-abdominal desmoid tumor, that induces durable responses."
"Desmoid type fibromatoses has proven to be a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, as they often appear primarily as a carcinoma of the breast with a high recurrence risk. Patients: A digital archive search was performed for the period from 2009 to the end of 2018. Inclusion criteria consisted of histological examination of at least the surgical specimen in the reference pathology department and at least a second opinion diagnosis in the reference radiology department. Results: A total of 14 women and 1 man underwent surgery on desmoid type fibromatosis of the breast. The average patient age was 49 years (range: 22-72 years). The mean tumor size was 2.2 cm (range: 0.8-4.2 cm). The tumor was detectable in mammography in 12 out of 13 patients and in all 15 patients in sonography. MRI was performed preoperatively in 6 patients; in all of the patients, the tumor was visualized with inhomogeneous contrast enhancement. In the imaging procedures, all desmoid type fibromatoses were classified as suspicious. Performing the core biopsy, preoperative histology confirmed desmoid fibromatosis in 12 out of 15 patients. Nuclear stain for ss-catenin was positive in 7 out of 10 patients. Negative staining was found for AE1/A3 in 10 out of 10 and CD34 in 12 out of 12 patients. In all of the patients, a single-stage operation without the detection of border-forming tumor margins was performed. The follow-up interval ranged from 16 to 96 months (mean: 44.86 months, median: 43 months). In this follow-up period, no patient was diagnosed with desmoid tumor recurrence. Conclusion: In imaging, desmoid type fibromatosis of the breast has typical malignancy-related criteria. Extensive preoperative diagnostics enable the planning of complete primary excision of the lesion and reduce the recurrence risk."
"Pediatric nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas (NRSTSs) encompass a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal tumors with more than 50 histologic variants. The incidence of NRSTS is greater than rhabdomyosarcoma; however, each histologic type is rare. The treatment schema for all NRSTSs is largely surgical. The treatment is a risk-adapted approach based on tumor size, localization, tumor grade, and presence of metastases. Low-grade tumors are mainly managed by surgery alone, whereas for high-grade tumors a multimodal treatment concept is necessary. The multimodal treatment consists of tumor biopsy, chemotherapy, local treatment (surgery +/- radiotherapy), and immunotherapy in selected conditions."
"Differential responses to tamoxifen may be due to inter-patient variability in tamoxifen metabolism into pharmacologically active Z-endoxifen. Z-endoxifen administration was anticipated to bypass these variations, increasing active drug levels, and potentially benefitting patients responding sub-optimally to tamoxifen. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with treatment-refractory gynecologic malignancies, desmoid tumors, or hormone receptor-positive solid tumors took oral Z-endoxifen daily with a 3+3 phase 1 dose escalation format over 8 dose levels (DLs). Safety, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and clinical outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty-four of 40 patients were evaluable. No maximum tolerated dose was established. DL8, 360 mg/day, was used for the expansion phase and is higher than doses administered in any previous study; it also yielded higher plasma Z-endoxifen concentrations. Three patients had partial responses and 8 had prolonged stable disease (>/= 6 cycles); 44.4% (8/18) of patients at dose levels 6-8 achieved one of these outcomes. Six patients who progressed after tamoxifen therapy experienced partial response or stable disease for >/= 6 cycles with Z-endoxifen; one with desmoid tumor remains on study after 62 cycles (nearly 5 years). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of antitumor activity and prolonged stable disease are achieved with Z-endoxifen despite prior tamoxifen therapy, supporting further study of Z-endoxifen, particularly in patients with desmoid tumors."
"Many soft tissue masses have an indeterminate appearance on MRI, often displaying varying degrees and extent of T2 hyperintensity. However, a subset of neoplasms and tumor-like lesions may exhibit prominent areas of T2 hypointensity relative to skeletal muscle. The hypointensity observed on T2-weighted MRI can be caused by a variety of substances, including evolving blood products, calcifications or other inorganic crystals, or fibrous tissue. Carefully evaluating the presence and pattern of T2 hypointensity in soft tissue masses and considering potential causes in their associated clinical contexts can help to narrow the differential diagnosis among neoplastic and non-neoplastic possibilities. These include endometriosis, aneurysmal bone cysts, tenosynovial giant cell tumor, arteriovenous malformation and pseudoaneurysm, calcium pyrophosphate and hydroxyapatite deposition diseases, tumoral calcinosis, gout, amyloidosis, hemangiomas with phleboliths, low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, ossifying fibromyxoid tumor, collagenous fibroma, desmoid-type fibromatosis, myxofibrosarcoma, peripheral nerve sheath tumors, dedifferentiated liposarcoma, and treated sarcoma."
"Desmoid tumors have a variable clinical course that ranges from indolence or spontaneous regression to an aggressive pattern marked by local invasion. Up to half may remain stable or regress; watchful waiting is the preferred approach in the initial management of desmoid tumors. Symptomatic or progressive tumors or those that may affect adjacent critical structures require surgery, radiotherapy, or systemic therapy. Although radiotherapy effectively controls desmoid tumors in most cases, concerns regarding late toxicity exist. Definitive radiotherapy for macroscopic disease is indicated when a non-morbid complete surgical resection cannot be accomplished and provides similar control rates to surgery plus radiotherapy but avoids toxicity from combined-modality treatment (surgery and radiotherapy). Adjuvant radiotherapy can be considered for microscopically involved margins, particularly for recurrent cases or when a future recurrence may be challenging to treat. Large size, extremity site, and younger age are poor prognostic factors after radiotherapy. In the extremity, radiotherapy may have superior outcomes to surgery. Younger patients, especially children, are challenging to manage as they are at particular risk for late toxicity due to the number of potential years at risk. For patients under 20 years old, for whom a non-morbid complete resection is not possible, we recommend systemic therapy as the first line of treatment. Although the long-term efficacy of systemic therapy is unproven, this strategy allows additional time for growth and development prior to radiotherapy. In younger patients and those with axial desmoid tumors adjacent to critical organs, consideration should be given to using proton therapy as the dosimetric advantages may mitigate some of the toxicity associated with conventional radiotherapy."
"Idiopathic gingival fibromatosis, also called idiopathic gingival overgrowth (IGO), is a rare benign condition that occurs either in isolation or as a part of a syndrome. The overgrowth, if excess, impedes oral functions such as mastication and speech and causes cosmetic disfigurement. Diagnosis and treatment becomes challenging if the overgrowth is massive and accompanies other associated pathologies. This case reports concurrent occurrence of three pathologies, i.e., IGO, aggressive periodontitis, and candidal infection in a 20-year-old healthy male patient. The surgical procedure performed involved internal bevel gingivectomy combined with open-flap surgery. Seven-year follow-up revealed no recurrence of overgrowth and stable periodontal condition."
"Aggressive fibromatosis of the abdominal wall is easily misdiagnosed prior to surgery as abdominal wall endometriosis or other tumors. The authors intend to evaluate the clinical features and outcomes of aggressive fibromatosis of the abdominal wall after surgical resection. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data from 24 patients treated in the First Hospital of China Medical University from January 2011 to June 2019 and discussed the characteristic of this disease after a review of literature worldwide. RESULTS: Most patients were female (91.7%) with a mean age of 33 years (range 26-56 years). The most common symptom was progressive abdominal wall discomfort (ie, abdominal pain) in 16 patients (66.7%). Twelve patients (50%) had a history of cesarean section. All 24 patients underwent surgical R0 resection due to progression of disease or pain, including 12 patients treated with simple tumor resection and 12 patients treated with tumor resection followed by abdominal wall tension-free repair using synthetic mesh. Postoperative complications included incisional infection in three patients (12.5%), incisional hernia and postoperative bleeding in one patient each (4.2%). The local recurrence rate was 12.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive fibromatosis of the abdominal wall mainly occurs in young women after cesarean section or other surgeries, with a high recurrence rate. Radical resection is an optimal treatment for the patients with progressive cases, and the restoration of extensive defects of the abdominal wall can be achieved with synthetic mesh, which leads to a good restoration of abdominal wall integrity."
"Intra-abdominal desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) rarely necessitates emergency surgery. However, the condition is difficult to diagnose preoperatively and can become life-threatening if left untreated. CASE REPORT: A 46-year-old man complained of fever and right lower quadrant pain. In computed tomography, the mesenteric side of the ascending colon demonstrated air and fluid collections, suggesting diverticulitis with abscess. After 2 weeks of conservative treatment with fasting, the patient started to consume food; nonetheless, fever returned. Colonoscopy and contrast enema detected a fistula extending from the ascending colon to the abscess, with no surrounding lesions. Surgery was then performed because the abscess was refractory. During laparotomy, the scar tissue of the abscess was found to be attached to the lateral wall of the ascending colon. Hence, right colectomy combined with abscess resection was performed. Histopathological findings revealed DF in the mesentery. CONCLUSION: Although rare, DF should be included in the preoperative differential diagnosis of intra-abdominal abscesses."
"Desmoid tumours, also known as aggressive fibromatosis, are fibromuscular neoplasms that arise from mesenchymal cell lines. Desmoid tumours are usually benign and are locally aggressive tumours. We report a case of a 31-year-old man presenting with abdominal mass associated with dyspepsia and early satiety. CT scan demonstrated a large heterogeneous mass adherent to or arising from the jejunum. The patient underwent a successful elective exploratory laparotomy with resection of the tumour arising from the wall of the ileum with a 10 cm margin. The patient had an uneventful recovery and no recurrence at 6-month follow-up. Pathology report and immunohistochemistry analysis revealed the mass to be a primary desmoid tumour of the small bowel, as the tumour was negative for c-kit and Discovered on GIST 1 (DOG-1) and positive for beta-catenin and smooth muscle actin."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is a fibrous tumor characterized by low-grade malignant and easy invasive growth and high recurrence. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy has been identified as a novel non-invasive approach for DF treatment; however, the ultrasonic energy generated by HIFU can cause skin heat injury. Case: A 31-year-old female patient with signs and symptoms of DF received treatment in our institution. The patient had undergone HIFU treatment six times from April 27, 2018, to August 21, 2019. After HIFU therapy for the third time, she had a third-degree skin burn showing as orange peel-like change and spent three months to promote the recovery of the skin lesions. An intermittent ice-cooling strategy was used to avoid skin damage during the fourth HIFU treatment. This patient did not have any apparent skin injury during the last three HIFU therapy and acquired satisfactory anti-tumor therapeutic effect. Conclusions: There are differences in the thermal selectivity of tumor tissues, which leads to different critical thermal injury temperature values that the tissue can tolerate. Ice-cooling can lower skin tissue temperature and reduce the thermal damage caused by HIFU treatment."
"More effective therapies are needed to treat progressive desmoid tumors when active surveillance and systemic therapy fail. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of sandwich isolation surgery on the local control of progressive desmoid tumors involving neurovascular bundles. METHODS: A total of 27 patients with progressive desmoid tumors at extremities involving neurovascular bundles who received surgery at our hospital between August 2014 and August 2018 were identified. A total of 13 patients received sandwich isolation surgery, in which R2 resection was performed in neurovasculature-involving regions, and a biomaterial patch was used to envelop involved neurovascular structures and isolate residual tumors. In non-neurovasculature-involving regions, wide resection was performed without isolation. A total of 14 patients received traditional surgery, which included tumor resection without isolation procedure. RESULTS: In sandwich isolation group, tumor progressions and local recurrences occurred in 3 patients outside the isolated neurovasculature-involving regions. However, no progressions or recurrences occurred in any patients in the isolated neurovasculature-involving regions where R2 resection was performed. Sandwich isolation surgery group and traditional surgery group shared similar baseline clinical characteristics. The estimated 3-yr event-free survival rate was 76.9% after sandwich isolation surgery, and 32.7% after traditional surgery (P = .025). Patients who received sandwich isolation surgery were less likely to have local recurrence (hazard ratio: 0.257, P = .040). No complications were noted except intermittent mild pain in operative regions (2 cases). CONCLUSION: Sandwich isolation surgery is effective and safe for local control of desmoid tumors involving neurovascular bundles."
"Primary chest wall sarcoma is a rare entity. It can be classified based on its origin, as bone sarcomas or soft tissue sarcomas. Various prognostic factors have been studied in different case series like age, sex, tumor histology, grade, resection margin status, adjuvant treatment, and others. The present study aimed to analyze common histological types, their management by resection and reconstruction and prognosis, in cases presenting at a regional cancer center in western India. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This was an observational study from a prospectively maintained database. 57 patients with chest wall sarcoma treated with curative intent between January 2016 till January 2019 with a minimum follow-up of 3 months were included in the study. The goals of surgical treatment were to obtain a wide resection margin of 3-4 cm, preserve the function of the chest wall and provide stability and rigidity to protect intrathoracic organs. RESULTS: The median follow-up of the present patient's cohort was for 20.2 months. Overall two-year survival was 74.7%. Two-year OS and DFS of bone sarcoma were 62.3% and 35% and soft tissue sarcomas were 91% and 71.3%. Ewing's sarcoma had the worst two-year overall survival of 50.6% and chondrosarcoma and fibromatosis had 100% two-year overall survival. CONCLUSION: Chest wall sarcoma forms a heterogeneous group of tumors. In the present study, Ewing's sarcoma was the most common histology with the worst survival, since they presented in advanced stages. Management should be multidisciplinary and surgical resection should be aggressive to achieve an R0 resection. Reconstruction of chest wall should aim to provide structural and functional stability with minimal morbidity. Frozen section assessment should be utilized whenever in doubt."
"Management of large abdominal wall desmoid tumours is complicated due to the unpredictable behaviour of desmoids and the need for laborious reconstruction of the abdominal wall after wide local excision. A multidisciplinary team approach, including surgeons, oncologists and plastic surgeons, is necessary for proper management. This case highlights the diagnostic and surgical challenges related to the reconstruction of abdominal wall defect, after radical excision of a 30x30x25 cm desmoid tumour, originating from left rectus muscle. The defect was closed successfully by a perspicuous technique of posterior component separation. The awareness of this straightforward technique will allow the surgeons to do these radical procedures with confidence and without any consternation of complex reconstructive procedures."
"Recent studies suggest that desmoid tumors can be managed more conservatively rather than undergoing wide surgical resection (SR). Ultrasound-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy (UGVAB) is a minimally invasive technique. This retrospective study aimed to compare the outcome in patients with breast desmoid tumor (BDT) who received UGVAB alone versus SR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pathology database was searched for patients diagnosed with BDT </= 3 cm from 2007 to 2019. All patients underwent breast ultrasound examination and were then performed UGVAB alone or local SR. The Kaplan-Meier method with a log-rank test was used as a univariate analysis to compare the relapse-free survival (RFS) rates between UGVAB and SR groups. Cox regression analysis was used for multivariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 39 patients were included. The median follow-up was 41 mo (range, 5-110 mo). The incidence of tumor recurrence was 23.1% (9/39). The 3-y cumulative RFS was 83.1% and 95.8% in the UGVAB and SR group, respectively, which was not significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.131, log-rank test). Multivariate analysis also revealed that treatment strategy (UGVAB versus SR) was not associated with an increased risk of relapse events (P = 0.274). CONCLUSIONS: Small desmoid tumors (</=3 cm) after UGVAB alone did not have a significantly compromised RFS compared with those who underwent SR. UGVAB may be an alternative and relatively conservative method for the diagnosis and local control of BDT with a smaller size. A prospective, randomized study with large sample size is needed to confirm this observation."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is a rare soft tissue lesion with an annual incidence of 2 to 4 per million population and peak incidence occurring at approximately 4.5 years of age. While benign, the tumor has a locally aggressive infiltrative growth pattern and a high rate of recurrence. Given the functional and aesthetic implications of excision and reconstruction in the facial skeleton, novel medical treatment options are highly desirable. We describe the case of a 3-year-old boy who presented with an enlarging, asymptomatic mass involving the left mandible. Biopsy revealed an immunohistochemical profile consistent with DF. Despite the high likelihood of recurrence, conservative, mandible-sparing en bloc resection and limited mandibulectomy were performed. Pathological and immunohistochemical analysis of the resection specimen revealed DF with grossly positive margins and elevated expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor. Postoperative medical treatment with the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan was initiated. The patient remains medically stable and disease progression-free on repeat imaging at 20 months post-resection. We describe for the first time the successful use of the angiotensin blocker losartan following conservative surgery for management of DF."
"Surgery is an effective treatment for desmoid fibromatosis, but it may be difficult, depending on the location or local spread of the tumor, and the decision to perform surgery must be made carefully. We herein report a case of desmoid fibromatosis of the chest wall in a young woman suspected of having invasion to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd ribs. CASE PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old woman had been aware of dry cough and right chest pain, so she was referred to our hospital. Chest computed tomography showed a localized pleural tumor mainly at the first rib. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 75 x 65 x 27-mm tumor with a smooth surface, with partial contact from the first rib to third rib and partial extension to the 1st intercostal space. The tumor showed growth in the two months after the first visit, so resection was performed. The tumor was completely resected, and adjuvant radiation therapy (50 Gy) was performed for the small margin. The pathological diagnosis was desmoid fibromatosis. The postoperative course has been uneventful, without recurrence at 14 months after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In chest wall tumors located ventral of the pulmonary apex, we suggest that a combination of the Grunenwald method and Masaoka anterior approach may be a useful option. In cases where margin is not enough, adjuvant radiation therapy should be considered."
"Here we report a case of a 41-year-old male patient who underwent resection of a desmoid tumor originating from the greater omentum with no history of open surgery. An elastic hard mass was palpated in the left upper abdomen, but there were no abnormalities on serum chemical tests, including tumor markers. Computed tomography showed a parenchymal tumor located near the descending colon. Integrated positron-emission tomography and computed tomography revealed moderate accumulation of tracer in the tumor. An intra-abdominal malignant mesenchymoma was suspected and surgery was performed. The tumor was located in the anterior portion of the greater omentum. It partially invaded the diaphragm, and the affected regions were concurrently resected. The resected specimen measured 80 mm at longest diameter. The cut surface was grayish white and parenchymal. The histopathological findings showed the atypical spindle shaped tumor cells grown with collagen fiber progression. Immunohistochemical staining for beta-catenin showed strong staining in the nuclei and cytoplasm of tumor cells. The patient was diagnosed with desmoid tumor originating from the greater omentum. The desmoid tumor with no history of open surgery was rare. We report this rare case, along with a discussion of the literature."
"Desmoid tumor is one kind of fibromatosis, and much occurs the abdominal wall and outside the abdominal wall. Intra- abdominal desmoid tumor is rare at about 8%. We experienced a case of intra-abdominal desmoid tumors occurring 4 years after open radical prostatectomy with some literature review. A 72-year-old man had undergone open radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. Four years after that resection, multiple intra-abdominal tumors measuring 56 mm in maximum diameter was identified on follow-up computed tomography, and he was referred to our department for management. We performed laparotomy and investigation of the biopsy. Immunohistochemistry of the resected specimen indicated the tumor cells were positive for vimentin and beta-catenin, and the diagnosis was desmoid. We performed partial resection of the small intestine and ileocecal resection. His postoperative course was uneventful and he was discharged on the 12th postoperative day. He has shown no sign of recurrence in the 4 months follow-up since surgery. In the past, an operation was the best treatment for intra-abdominal desmoid tumor. But it is reported that watchful waiting is also possible by the case which has no symptom and dysfunction in NCCN guidelines 2019. Further research is needed."
"Mutations of the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) gene correlate mainly with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), but can occasionally be pathogenic for medulloblastoma (MBL) wingless-related integration site (WNT) subtype, the course of which has only recently been described. METHODS: We retrieved all patients with documented germline APC mutations and a diagnosis of MBL to examine their outcome, late effects of treatment, and further oncological events. RESULTS: Between 2007 and 2016, we treated six patients, all with a pathogenic APC variant mutation and all with MBL, classic histotype. None had metastatic disease. All patients were in complete remission a median 65 months after treatment with craniospinal irradiation at 23.4 Gy, plus a boost on the posterior fossa/tumor bed up to 54 Gy, followed by cisplatin/carboplatin, lomustine, and vincristine for a maximum of eight courses. Five of six diagnostic revised MRI were suggestive of the WNT molecular subgroup typical aspects. Methylation profile score (in two cases) and copy number variation analysis (chromosome 6 deletion in two cases) performed on four of six retrieved samples confirmed WNT molecular subgroup. Four out of six patients had a positive family history of FAP, while gastrointestinal symptoms prompted its identification in the other two cases. Four patients developed other tumors (desmoid, MELTUMP, melanoma, pancreatoblastoma, thyroid Tir3) from 5 to 7 years after MBL. DISCUSSION: Our data confirm a good prognosis for patients with MBL associated with FAP. Patients' secondary tumors may or may not be related to their syndrome or treatment, but warrant adequate attention when planning shared guidelines for these patients."
"Desmoid fibromatosis (DF) is a locally aggressive connective-tissue tumor arising in deep soft tissues. Although multiple therapeutic modalities have been demonstrated effective for DF, there is no standard systemic treatment for progressive and recurrent DF. As a part of systemic treatment, tyrosine kinase inhibitors have shown promising activity against DF with tolerable toxicity profiles. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib, a novel multi-target angiogenesis inhibitor, in patients with DF. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of patients with advanced extremity DF regularly treated with apatinib between October 2017 and January 2020 in our center. Apatinib was initially administered with a dose of 250 mg daily and the dose was adjusted according to the toxicity. Tumor response was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 criteria. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); objective response rates and drug-related adverse events were also evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 22 (6 male, 16 female) patients with advanced extremity DF were included. The mean medication time was 17 months. None of the patients reached a complete response, but ten (45.5%) patients achieved partial response, and 11 patients (50%) achieved stable disease. One (4.5%) patient developed progressive disease, and the 1-year PFS rate was 95.2%. The disease control rate was 95.4% (21/22) and the objective response rate was 45.5% (10/22). Meanwhile, 18 (81.8%) patients with a tumor shrinkage were accompanied by a decreased signal intensity of lesions in T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. The most frequent adverse events included hand-foot syndrome (n = 7, 31.8%), fatigue (n = 6, 27.2%), local pain (n = 4, 18.1%), diarrhea (n = 4, 18.1%). CONCLUSION: Apatinib is an effective and well-tolerated option for patients with advanced extremity DF. Indeed, further prospective, randomized studies with larger cases are required to fully explore the clinical utility of apatinib in DF."

"Neuromuscular choristoma (NMC) is a peripheral nerve malformation frequently associated with a fibromatosis (NMC-DTF) that mimics sporadic desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF). Sporadic DTF is often managed conservatively but its clinical behavior varies. CTNNB1 mutational subtypes in sporadic DTF have prognostic value. We have previously identified CTNNB1 mutations in NMC, and 3 paired NMC-DTF but the clinical behavior of NMC-DTF is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patients with NMC-DTF to determine (1) CTNNB1 mutational subtypes in NMC-DTF, and (2) associated clinical behavior and response to treatment. METHODS: Retrospective review of clinical, imaging, and pathologic features of patients with NMC and NMC-DTF, and molecular testing for CTNNB1 mutations. RESULTS: Among 7 patients with NMC of the sciatic nerve (median age: 18 yr), NMC-DTF (mean size 10.7 cm) developed shortly following NMC biopsy (N = 5) or spontaneously (N = 2): 6 NMC-DTF had CTNNB1 p.S45X mutations and 1 NMC-DTF had a p.T41A mutation. All patients with CTNNB1-p.S45-mutated NMC-DTF developed local progression after wide local excision or active surveillance, including one distal metachronous NMC-DTF. No patient had spontaneous disease stabilization. Following adjuvant radiation or systemic therapy, disease stabilization was achieved in 4 (of 6) patients. One patient progressed on sorafenib treatment. CONCLUSION: NMC-DTF frequently contain CTNNB1 p.S45 mutations, behave aggressively, and require adjuvant therapies for disease stabilization. We now use imaging alone to diagnose NMC, and routinely surveille the NMC-affected nerve segment to identify early NMC-DTF. In contrast to sporadic DTF, earlier adoption of systemic therapeutic strategies may be required for optimal disease management of NMC-DTF."
"Desmoid tumors are rare myofibroblastic neoplasms characterized by local invasiveness and high rates of recurrence, and sometimes mimic local recurrence of previously resected malignancies. Previous studies have suggested that molecular profiling may be useful for the diagnosis of the tumors and risk stratification. However, the clinical utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for the management of desmoid tumors has not been established. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 42-year-old man visited our clinic for routine follow-up 1 year after left upper lobe lingular segmentectomy for lung adenocarcinoma. DIAGNOSES: Chest computed tomography showed a pleural mass adherent to the thoracotomy site. Positron emission tomography revealed mildly increased metabolism with a maximal standardized uptake value of 2.7 within the tumor, suggesting local recurrence of the previous neoplasm. Exploratory thoracotomy and en bloc resection of the tumor revealed spindle cells in a massive collagenous tissue consistent with a desmoid tumor. INTERVENTIONS: NGS was performed to confirm the diagnosis and to identify any genetic alterations that might be relevant to the prognosis of this tumor. The tumor harbored an S45F mutation in CTNNB1, which has been correlated with a high recurrence rate. Therefore, we performed adjuvant radiotherapy on the resection bed at a dose of 56 Gy. OUTCOMES: The patients experienced no postoperative or radiotherapy-related complications. Periodic follow-up examinations using computed tomography were performed every 3 months, and no evidence of recurrence of either tumor was observed during the 38 months after the last surgery. LESSONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reporting the clinical application of NGS and aggressive treatment based on the genotyping results for the management of a desmoid tumor. Our case highlights the need to consider desmoid tumors among the differential diagnoses when a pleural mass is encountered at a previous thoracotomy site. More importantly, molecular profiling using NGS can be useful for the establishment of a treatment strategy for this tumor, although further investigations are required."
"Superficial vein thrombosis has traditionally been considered a disease of the lower extremity. Less frequently it can affect the breast, chest wall, penis, or upper extremity. Cases involving upper extremities are usually associated with intravascular access, and the vast majority remain self-limiting. This case report presents a 63-year-old patient who had acute extensive thrombosis of cephalic and basilic venous systems following resection of a desmoid tumor from the flank. This was likely related to intraoperative positioning and resulted in severe symptoms mimicking deep vein thrombosis and carpal tunnel syndrome. Additionally, diagnostic tools available to the hand surgeon that allow prompt diagnosis, management, and prevention are discussed."
"Desmoid tumors are a rare, locally invasive, non-metastasizing tumor of mesenchymal origin. Most of such tumors occur sporadically, but some arise as part of germline adenomatous polyposis coli mutations. They tend to aggregate in the abdomen, thorax, extremities, and the head and neck region. They are challenging to treat, with a high rate of recurrence even if achieving negative margins. We present the case of an 18-year-old woman with a desmoid tumor involving her brachial plexus. A non-oncological resection was performed, with a focus on functional preservation. Residual disease is being treated with beta-catenin inhibitor and monitored with serial MRI."
"In the context of a post-treatment testicular germ cell tumour, an abdominal lesion found on surveillance CT studies led to a differential diagnosis, including recurrent germ cell tumour. We report the case of a 48-year-old man who was noted to have a new interval soft tissue lesion on a surveillance CT scan, 5 years after initial orchidectomy and chemotherapy. Excision of this lesion and histopathological review revealed an intra-abdominal desmoid."
"Colonic volvulus, a condition in which a colonic segment partially twists around its base, is the third leading cause of large bowel obstruction after colonic neoplasms and diverticular disease. However, volvulus of the transverse colon is the rarest type of large intestinal volvulus. Moreover, the occurrence of transverse colonic volvulus secondary to a benign tumor originating from outside the intestine has never been reported. We hereby report a case of transverse colonic volvulus caused by mesenteric fibromatosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 53-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and thyroid tumor presented with abdominal pain for 1 day. Abdominal computed tomography revealed intestinal torsion at the hepatic flexure. Twisted and obstructed mucosa of the transverse colon was observed during colonoscopy, but no tumor invasion of the mucosal surface was detected. A solid mass of a mesenteric origin with involvement of the transverse colon was observed during surgery. The mass was diagnosed surgically as transverse colonic volvulus induced by a mesenteric tumor. Hence, the patient underwent a right hemicolectomy. Histopathological results indicated mesenteric desmoid-type fibromatosis. The postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged 8 days after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Although mesenteric fibromatosis is rare, this disease should be considered when managing transverse colonic volvulus resulting from nonmucosal tumors."
"This study compared the clinical and functional outcomes of patients initially treated with observation or medical treatment with those of patients treated with local treatment (surgery alone or surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy) to confirm whether observation or medical treatment is an appropriate first-line management approach for patients with desmoid tumors. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 99 patients with histologically confirmed primary desmoid tumors treated between 1978 and 2018. The median follow-up period was 57 months. We evaluated event-free survival, defined as the time interval from the date of initial diagnosis to the date of specific change in treatment strategy or recurrence or the last follow-up. RESULTS: An event (specific change in treatment strategy or recurrence) occurred in 28 patients (28.3%). No significant difference in event-free survival was found between the first-line observation/medical treatment and local treatment groups (p = 0.509). The median Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score of the patients treated with first-line local treatment was 29 (interquartile range [IQR], 23-30), whereas that of the patients managed with first-line observation or medical treatment was 21 (IQR, 19-29.5). First-line observation or medical treatment was more frequently chosen for larger tumors (p = 0.045). In the patients treated with local treatment, local recurrence was not related to the surgical margin (p = 0.976). CONCLUSION: Upfront surgery is not advantageous compared to more conservative treatments such as observation or medical treatment for patients with desmoid tumors."
"Desmoid tumor (DT) is a rare, locally aggressive benign neoplasm with a high recurrence rate. The majority of sporadic DTs are associated with mutations in CTNNB1, but whether CTNNB1 mutations are associated with the risk of DT recurrence remains unclear. The goal of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the association between CTNNB1 mutation and recurrence in surgically treated DT patients. Methods: PubMed, Embase and Cochrane library were systematically searched. The outcome of interest was the risk of recurrence. The number of patients with CTNNB1 mutation and the number of recurrences they developed were recorded and compared. The quality of these studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Odds ratios and variances were calculated and pooled. Results: A total of eight studies were identified including 637 patients. S45F-mutated DTs were more likely to recur compared with wild type, T41A and other mutated DTs. However, there were no statistically significant differences in the rate of recurrence between wild type and T41A mutation or other mutation. Conclusions: Among CTNNB1 mutations, the mutation S45F is a high-risk factor for recurrence of DT and may be a predictive marker for the recurrence of sporadic DT."
"Desmoid tumors are benign, but may have a locally invasive tendency that commonly results in local recurrence. Most occur on the body trunk or extremities, whereas a head and neck desmoid tumor is relatively rare. The efficacy of radiotherapy has been suggested and 50-60 Gy is used for unresectable or recurrent desmoid tumors, but there are few reports of use of particle beam therapy. However, since this tumor occurs more often in younger patients compared to malignant tumors and the prognosis is favorable, there may be an advantage of this therapy. We treated a male patient with a head and neck recurrent desmoid tumor with proton beam therapy (PBT) at a dose of 60 Gy (RBE). This patient underwent surgical resection as initial treatment, but the tumor recurred only six months after surgery, and resection was performed again. After PBT, the tumor gradually shrank and complete remission has been achieved for 10 years without any severe late toxicity. Here, we report the details of this case, with a review of the literature. We suggest that PBT may reduce the incidence of second malignant tumors by reducing the dose exposure around the planning target volume."

"To study the clinicopathological features and differential diagnosis of gastrofibromatosis-like undifferentiated carcinoma (GFLUC). METHODS: Three patients with GFLUC underwent histological and immunophenotypic analyses and fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) gene amplification. RESULTS: Among the three patients (2 male [36 and 44 years old], 1 female [58 years old]), two had lesions in the gastric body and one had lesions in the gastric antrum. Histological analysis revealed mixtures of aggressive fibromatosis and undifferentiated carcinoma in all three cases. Highly invasive fibromatous tissue, consisting of fibroblasts, proliferating myofibroblasts, and collagenous fibrous tissues, accounted for >90% of the tumor, with undifferentiated cancerous tissue accounting for <10% scattered in the gaps within the invasive fibromatous tissue, with no glandular ducts or nests. Immunophenotypic analysis showed that the undifferentiated cancerous cells were positive for pan-cytokeratin, CDX2, villin, and p53, while the cytoplasm of invasive fibromatous cells was positive for vimentin, beta-catenin, and smooth muscle actin. No HER2 gene amplification was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike other gastric carcinomas, GFLUC shows specific histological, biological, and immunophenotypic characteristics."
"A literature review on desmoid tumors was carried out, which are tumors that affect soft tissues with a locally aggressive behavior and are unable to metastasize. Sporadic cases are located on the extremities and chest wall; hereditary cases have an intra-abdominal predilection, and those associated with pregnancy occur on the abdominal wall. Imaging techniques assess disease extension. Trucut biopsy is the study of choice for diagnosis. Mutations in the CTNNB1 or APC genes cause an abnormal accumulation of b-catenin within the cell. In this review, an emphasis is made on therapeutic strategies' evolution and change, and current tools for decision making are analyzed, as well as clinical outcomes. Radiation therapy can play a therapeutic or adjuvant role. Advances in the understanding of the disease have allowed establishing better targeted treatments with lower morbidity; however, there are still unanswered questions regarding the choice of the ideal candidate for surveillance and/or early treatment. Data related to quality of life are also presented, as well as the uncertainty generated by this diagnosis for both doctor and patient."
"Mediastinal tumors may cause a wide range of symptoms; therefore, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis, after excluding common causes, when dealing with pulmonary and cardiac symptoms such as dyspnea or even mitral regurgitation. The most common site of the desmoid tumors is the abdomen, but in very rare cases, it can be located in the mediastinum."
"Ligamentoid fibromatosis is a rare borderline tumor that occurs in the muscles, fascia, and aponeurosis. It is a kind of soft tissue tumor of fibrous origin, also known as invasive fibromatosis, desmoid fibroma, neurofibromatosis, etc. The tumor is between benign and malignant tumors and rarely has distant metastasis. Its characteristics are mainly local invasion, destruction and growth and easy recurrence. The World Health Organization defines it as a fibroblast cloning value-added lesion originating from deep soft tissue, which causes local invasion and growth leading to tissue reconstruction, extrusion and destruction of important structures and organs. The incidence rate accounts for 0.03% of all tumors and less than 3% of all soft tissue tumors. Definite diagnosis mainly depends on postoperative pathology. Surgical resection is still the main way to treat the disease, and a variety of nonsurgical treatment methods are auxiliary. Combined treatment can effectively reduce the risk of postoperative recurrence. CASE SUMMARY: The patient is a 57-year-old female. One week ago, she accidentally found a mass in the left upper abdomen while lying flat. There was no abdominal pain and abdominal distention, no fever, no black stool and blood in the stool and no nausea and vomiting. She had a 10-year history of glaucoma on the left side, underwent hysterectomy for uterine fibroids 5 years ago, had no hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, hepatitis or tuberculosis, had no history of smoking and had been drinking for 20 years. CONCLUSION: Accurate preoperative diagnosis is difficult, surgical resection is the main treatment, and a variety of nonsurgical treatment methods are auxiliary. Combined treatment can effectively reduce the risk of postoperative recurrence. The prognosis is still good, and the risk of recurrence of secondary surgery is greatly increased."

"A 74-year-old man with biochemical recurrent prostate cancer underwent 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT for restaging to determine subsequent treatment strategy. 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT imaging demonstrated incidental focal heterogeneous increased 18F-fluciclovine uptake corresponding to a soft tissue nodule within the musculature of the left anterior abdominal wall. Subsequent ultrasound-guided biopsy of the lesion revealed histopathology compatible with a desmoid tumor. Consequently, the patient underwent surgical resection with wide local excision of the lesion."
"desmoid tumors (DTs) are common in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). An active surveillance approach has been recently proposed as a valuable alternative to immediate treatment in some patients. However, no clear indication exists on which patients are suitable for active surveillance, how to establish the cut-off for an active treatment, and which imaging technique or predictive factors should be used during the surveillance period. (2) Results: we retrospectively analyzed 13 FAP patients with DTs. A surveillance protocol consisting of scheduled follow-up evaluations depending on tumor location and tissue thickening, abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan/Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allowed prompt intervention in 3/11 aggressive intra-abdominal DTs, while sparing further interventions in the remaining cases, despite worrisome features detected in three patients. Moreover, we identified a possible predictive marker of tumor aggressiveness, i.e., the ""average monthly growth rate"" (AMGR), which could distinguish patients with very aggressive/life-threatening tumor behavior (AMGR > 0.5) who need immediate active treatment, from those with stable DTs (AMGR < 0.1) in whom follow-up assessments could be delayed. (3) Conclusion: surveillance protocols may be a useful approach for DTs. Further studies on larger series are needed to confirm the usefulness of periodic CT scan/MRI and the value of AMGR as a prognostic tool to guide treatment strategies."
"Low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma (LGMS) is described as a distinct atypical myofibroblastic tumor often with fibromatosis-like features and predilection for the head and neck, especially the oral cavity and larynx. LGMS arising in the levator scapulae muscle is extremely rare. CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because she noticed a hard mass in her left neck six months prior. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) showed a soft tissue tumor of the left levator scapulae muscle. A core needle biopsy showed cellular fascicles or a storiform growth pattern of spindle-shaped tumor cells with minimally atypia. Immunohistochemistry revealed focally positive for alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), negative for S-100, and a low-grade spindle cell sarcoma was suspected. Following a biopsy, the tumor was resected with a wide surgical margin. Immunohistochemical staining was a positive for vimentin and alpha-SMA and negative for desmin, CD34, nuclear beta-catenin, and h-caldesmon. LGMS diagnosis was determined based on the histopathological findings. The patient was alive with no evidence of disease eight years after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of LGMS arising in the levator scapulae muscle. In addition to the case report, 48 reports with 103 LGMS cases are reviewed and discussed. In previous reports of LGMS, there were 43 females and 60 males, with a mean age of 43.0 years (range, 2-75). There were 13 (12.6%) patients aged < 18 years, 67 (65.1%) patients aged 18 to 59 years, and 23 (22.3%) patients aged >/=60 years. The average tumor size was 4.4 cm (range: 0.4-22.0). The commonest sites of LGMS was the tongue. Tumor growth patterns were evaluated in 52 cases, and 44 cases (84.6%) showed infiltrative growth patterns. Local recurrence was 26.7%, and distant metastasis was 4.4%. Because of the locally aggressive feature, it is important to diagnose LGMS with biopsy and to excise the tumor with an adequately wide margin."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is an aggressive (myo)fibroblastic neoplasm with an infiltrative growth pattern and a tendency for local recurrence. It is rarely seen at the foot. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze clinical presentation, therapy, and outcomes in a consecutive series of four patients with DF at the foot. METHODS: From 1994 to 2014, four patients had been surgically treated. The resection margin was marginal or even intralesional in all. One patient already had local recurrence at first presentation. The end point was either local recurrence or progression of residual disease. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 27 years. In one patient, marginal excision healed the disease. In another patient, local recurrence after marginal resection necessitated distal phalanx amputation. Two other patients showed stable disease after either adjuvant radiotherapy or treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and tamoxifen. CONCLUSIONS: If surgery is necessary, operative margins are less important than keeping function for the patient. Radiotherapy might be an option to avoid major amputation. The role of adjuvant radiotherapy is controversially discussed. A watchful wait-and-see policy seems to be justified by the published data but may be difficult for DF at the foot."

"The performance of gamma secretase inhibitors (GSIs) in clinical trials generally has not reflected their encouraging performance in preclinical studies. This review provides a current perspective on the clinical performance of GSIs across various solid tumor types alongside putative mechanisms of antitumor activity. Through exploration of outstanding gaps in knowledge as well as reasons for success in certain cancer types, the authors identify areas for future investigation that will likely enable incorporation of GSIs into rational combinatorial strategies for superior tumor control and patient outcomes."

"To detect alterations in DNA damage repair (DDR) genes, measure homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), and correlate these findings with clinical outcome in patients with leiomyosarcoma (LMS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with LMS treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) Cancer Center who consented to prospective targeted next-generation sequencing with MSK-IMPACT were screened for oncogenic somatic variants in one of 33 DDR genes; where feasible, an experimental HRD score was calculated from IMPACT data. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated after stratifying patients by DDR gene alteration status and HRD score. RESULTS: Of 211 patients with LMS, 20% had an oncogenic DDR gene alteration. Univariable analysis of PFS in 117 patients who received standard frontline chemotherapy in the metastatic setting found that an altered homologous recombination pathway gene was significantly associated with shorter PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.79; 95% CI, 1.04 to 3.07; P = .035). Non-BRCA homologous recombination gene alteration was associated with shorter PFS (HR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.35 to 5.04; P = .004) compared with BRCA-altered and wild-type homologous recombination genes. Univariable analysis of OS from diagnosis in the entire cohort of 211 patients found that age, tumor size, number of metastatic sites, localized disease, and non-BRCA homologous recombination gene alteration were significantly associated with OS. On multivariable analysis, non-BRCA homologous recombination pathway gene alteration remained significant (HR, 4.91; 95% CI, 2.47 to 9.76; P < .001). High HRD score was not associated with a different PFS or OS. CONCLUSION: Patients with LMS with homologous recombination pathway gene alterations have poor clinical outcomes, particularly those with non-BRCA gene alterations. HRD score calculated from a targeted exome panel did not discern disparate clinical outcomes."
"Desmoid fibromatosis (DF) is a rare, locally aggressive but benign clonal fibroblastic lesion of deep soft tissue. It can occur at any age. Extra-abdominal lesions are more common in the pediatric population, with equal sex predilection. Desmoid fibromatosis of the head and neck, particularly the anterior neck, is more difficult to manage because of the proximity to vital structures and may eventually require definitive airway management with insertion of a tracheostomy tube. Indwelling tracheostomy tubes carry their own set of complications. This is the case of a 21-month-old boy who died suddenly due to tracheal obstruction by a hyperplastic polyp. He was diagnosed with DF of the neck before he was 1 month old and required an indwelling tracheostomy tube as a result. Chronic tracheostomy intubation can be complicated by granulation tissue polyp or, less commonly, fibroepithelial polyp formation that can become large enough to cause airway obstruction. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case of hyperplastic polyp causing fatal airway obstruction."
"We report a case of desmoid tumor that was initially diagnosed as metastasis from renal cell carcinoma. A follow-up computed tomographic (CT) scan after nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma in a 64-year-old man revealed a right retroperitoneal tumor 3.5 cm in diameter. Though the CT density of the tumor was similar to that of muscles, we first suspected metastasis from renal cell carcinoma or other cancer because the tumor growth was relatively fast. We resected the tumor. The pathological diagnosis was desmoid type fibromatosis. We also review six cases of desmoid tumors after nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma reported in Japan. Careful followup is required for the patients with desmoid tumors because of frequent recurrence."
"Pediatric head and neck desmoid tumors are rare neoplasms that can cause significant morbidity due to infiltration of vital anatomic structures. The goal of this study is to review presentation, evaluation, and management of these tumors. METHODS: Retrospective study of children with head and neck desmoid tumors treated from 1999 to 2018 and literature review. RESULTS: 11 patients (5 boys, 6 girls) were included. Presentation included firm neck mass (n = 8), trismus (n = 2) and tongue lesion (n = 1). All patients had preoperative imaging with CT (n = 2), MRI (n = 1) or both (n = 8). Five patients underwent needle biopsy, five had open biopsy and one was diagnosed on pathology from primary excision. Seven patients were treated by primary surgical resection, with positive surgical margins in six cases due to proximity to vital neurovascular structures. None needed chemotherapy, had disease recurrence or progression. Three patients with unresectable disease were treated with chemotherapy. One patient was monitored with imaging without any treatment and did not have disease progression. Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 6 years (median 21 months). Ten patients (7 surgical, 2 chemotherapy, 1 observation) were either disease-free or had stable disease at last follow-up. CONCLUSION: Pediatric head and neck desmoid tumors, though rare and histologically benign, are locally infiltrative and aggressive. When feasible, surgical treatment results in good disease control despite positive margins. A balance between achieving negative margins and minimizing functional deficits should be considered. Chemotherapy can be successfully utilized in patients where surgery entails a high risk of morbidity and mortality."
"Desmoid tumors are rare mesenchymal proliferative tumors that are highly invasive but lack metastatic potential. We report the case of a 72-year-old man with a desmoid tumor arising from the anterior chest wall which invaded neighboring organs extensively. The patient complained of dyspnea on exertion and appetite loss and was referred to our hospital. Chest computed tomography revealed an anterior chest wall tumor 12 cm in diameter adjacent to the right lung, diaphragm, and sternum. An ultrasound-guided biopsy was conducted, and the tumor was diagnosed as a desmoid tumor. He underwent right-sided anterior chest wall resection with combined resection of the right lung, diaphragm, and sternum body. The chest wall defect was reconstructed using an expanded polytetrafluorethylene mesh (dualmesh). Although initial active surveillance has recently been recommended for asymptomatic patients with non-progressing desmoid tumors, our patient underwent resection because of his symptoms."
"Aggressive fibromatosis or desmoid tumor is a rare disease resulting from fibroblasts which do not metastasize. However, desmoid tumors belong to low-grade malignant tumors since they have high potential to infiltrate surrounding tissues, causing high local recurrence rates and may affect surrounding organs, threatening life quality and expectancy. Although surgery, watch and wait, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, high intensity focused ultrasound, ablation techniques or several agents have all been frequently investigated for the treatment of this type of disease, none are deemed as standard therapy for high recurrence rates that have been supported by any data. The present review retrieved literature on treatment options for desmoids to summarize the latest treatment modalities and refine their efficacy, as well as their side effects, in order to provide a more comprehensive treatment reference for clinicians."
"A 32-year-old woman presented with progressive pain and swelling of the left wrist for 6 months. Physical examination revealed a firm, tender, oval swelling over the left wrist. X-rays showed a pressure effect on the distal radius and ulna. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed a well-defined, asymmetrical, dumbbell-shaped soft-tissue lesion involving the interosseous region of the distal forearm and extending until the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). Core needle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of desmoid tumour. Marginal excision of the tumour was done. At the 2-year follow-up, the patient was doing well and had painless and improved left wrist motion. Desmoid tumour involving the DRUJ has not been previously reported. We, through this case, report new observation and discuss the epidemiology, investigation of choice, treatment modalities, and the need for a regular follow-up for appendicular desmoid tumours."
"To assess the diagnostic accuracy of MRI in detecting recurrent aggressive fibromatosis (AF) during long-term follow-up at two multidisciplinary sarcoma centers. METHODS: Seventy-nine patients from two sarcoma centers were included in this IRB-approved study and were examined postoperatively using 1.5-T MRI. MRI follow-up scans were reviewed for true-positive/-negative and false-positive/-negative results. Available pathological reports and MRI follow-ups were set as reference. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 38.1+/-15.3 years. Of the patients 27.9 % showed recurrent AF lesions. The most common localizations of AF were the axilla/shoulder (n=15) and the thigh (n=11). From 498 postoperative MRI follow-ups, 24 true-positive, 16 false-positive, 6 false-negative, and 452 true-negative MRI follow-ups were identified. The overall sensitivity and specificity for detecting recurrent AF was 80 % and 97 %, respectively. There was no significant difference in the diagnostic accuracy at the two sarcoma centers. All false-negative results were found in small lesions. False-positive results mostly mimicked streaky (n=10) and small ovoid/nodular (n=5) lesions. The configuration of recurrent AF was significantly most often fascicular (50 %; p=0.001-0.005). CONCLUSION: MRI shows a high long-term diagnostic value in detecting AF recurrences. Nevertheless, radiologists should pay close attention when lesions are small, as they may remain undetected. Although the configuration of recurrent AF is most often fascicular, recurrences may also appear in different shapes."
"Desmoid tumors are rare tumors which can cause intestinal obstructions. Surgical wide excision is currently the treatment of choice, with the goal of achieving free resection margins."
"Desmoid-type fibromatoses (DTFs), also known as desmoid tumors, are benign but infiltrative neoplasms that often appear next to previous surgical site. Intra-abdominal tumors usually involve the mesentery, but splenic hilum is an unusual localization. We present a case of a desmoid tumor of the splenic hilum laparoscopically resected in a 70-year-old male with a previous history of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and ocular spindle melanoma. Although benign, desmoid tumors might be infiltrative and produce serious complications. Treatment remains controversial, ranging from surgery and medical therapies to observation. Management of DTF must be individualized, considering the risk of complications and recurrence."
"Gardner syndrome is a hereditary disease characterized by familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), accompanied by soft tissue tumors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: a Chinese FAP family was enrolled and followed-up for three years. RESULTS: a novel large germline fragment deletion (EX10_16DEL) of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene was identified by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). An unexpected abdominal tumor grew two years after a subtotal colectomy of the proband. The immunohistochemistry study of the abdominal tumor showed SMA(focal+), calponin(+), beta-catenin(nucleus+) and CD34(focal+), CD117(-), which was consistent with a desmoid tumor. CONCLUSION: when a FAP related desmoid tumor appears, the possibility of Gardner syndrome should be considered. This is the first largest deletion of the APC gene in the Chinese population associated with Gardner syndrome."
"Desmoid fibroma (DF) is a rare connective tissue tumor comprising about 0.03-0.13% of all neoplasms. DF has a low potential for malignant transformation, but it is characterized by aggressive course and unfavorable prognosis. The main contingent of patients consists of women of reproductive age. Despite the nearly two-century history of study, there are certain unsolved problems including endocrine problems associated with this disease. We report a 30-year-old female with DF and diabetes mellitus type 1. Total resection of the affected right rectus abdominis muscle was performed in a single block with aponeurotic sheath and peritoneum after normalization of carbohydrate metabolism. Muscular aponeurotic defect 2710 cm was closed after separation of abdominal wall structures and implantation of polypropylene prosthesis. There are no X-ray and clinical signs of DF recurrence or postoperative hernia after 8 months."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF), also known as deep fibromatosis or desmoid tumor, is an extremely rare neoplasm that develops from fascia and musculoaponeurotic tissue. These tumors are characterized by slow progressive growth, local invasion, and local recurrence after surgical excision, but they lack metastatic potential. DF accounts for 3.5% of all fibrous tumors, with an annual incidence of approximately 2-4/million. Until now, only a small number of cases have been found in the chest wall. Herein, we present a rare case of chest wall DF in a 43-year-old female, which was discovered accidentally due to a thoracic wall mass that extended outward from the sternum. Computed tomography scans revealed a subcutaneous soft tissue mass anterior to the sternum, which was considered to be a mesenchymal tumor or an inflammatory lesion. The patient underwent surgical excision of the mass. The mass was completely removed and all margins were negative. According to the pathological results, the patient was finally diagnosed as DF. Postoperative radiotherapy was suggested subsequently, especially considering the locally aggressive and infiltrative nature of the tumor. However, this was rejected by the patient, and biannual re-examination was recommended instead. Despite the absence of postoperative radiotherapy, there was no evidence of local recurrence 2 years later. We consider regular postoperative follow-up may be able to replace postoperative radiotherapy, and if there exist an opportunity to completely resect the mass, surgical is a worthwhile choice."
"The majority of desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) tumors harbor a beta-catenin mutation, affecting specific codons in CTNNB1 exon 3. S45F tumors are reported to have a higher chance of recurrence after surgery and more resistance to systemic treatments compared to wild-type (WT) and T41A tumors. The aim of this pilot study was to examine the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of S45F and T41A mutated DTF, to explain the observed differences in clinical behavior between these DTF subtypes. Material and Methods: Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation was performed using MeD-seq on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary DTF samples harboring a S45F (n = 14) or a T41A (n = 15) mutation. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between S45F and T41A DTF were identified and used for a supervised hierarchical cluster analysis. DMRs with a fold-change >/=1.5 were considered to be differentially methylated and differences between S45F and T41A tumors were quantitatively assessed. The effect of DMRs on the expression of associated genes was assessed using an independent mRNA expression dataset. Protein-protein interactions between WT beta-catenin and mutant variants and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) were examined by immunoprecipitation experiments. Results: MeD-seq analyses indicated 354 regions that displayed differential methylation. Cluster analysis yielded no distinct clusters based on mutation, sex, tumor site or tumor size. A supervised clustering based on DMRs between small (</=34 mm) and large (>87 mm) DTF distinguished the two groups. Only ten DMRs displayed a fold change of >/=1.5 and six of them were found associated with the following genes: NLRP4, FOXK2, PERM1, CCDC6, NOC4L, and DUX4L6. The effects of DMRs on gene expression yielded a significant difference (p < 0.05) in the expression between S45F and T41A for CCDC6 and FOXK2 but not for all Affymetrix probe-sets used to detect these genes. Immunoprecipitations did not reveal an association of WT beta-catenin or mutant variants with DNMT1. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that S45F and T41A DTF tumors did not exhibit gross differences in DNA methylation patterns. This implies that distinct DNA methylation profiles are not the sole determinant for the divergent clinical behavior of these different DTF mutant subtypes."
"Gardner syndrome is a subtype of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), characterized by a combination of adenomatous intestinal polyps and extracolonic lesions such as multiple osteomas, dental abnormalities, and soft tissue tumors. Although 12% of patients with intestinal polyposis of FAP may occur intra-abdominal desmoid tumors, pregnancy complicating with giant abdominal desmoid tumors is a relatively rare case. CASE PRESENTATION: A 28-year-old pregnant woman was diagnosed with Gardner syndrome in whom an intra-abdominal tumor was found a year after undergoing a laparoscopic total colectomy due to family adenomatous polyposis. At 32 weeks' gestation, she presented to our department for the third time complaining upper abdominal pain caused by the giant abdominal mass about 21 x 12 cm(2) in size. After multidisciplinary consultation and discussion, the decision of fetal preservation treatment was made. After the delivery of a baby girl, abdominal mass resection was performed, and pathological examination revealed a fibrous adenoma. The patient was discharged after a week and was uneventful in the follow-up for half a year. CONCLUSIONS: Gardner syndrome is characterized by typical syndrome including family adenomatous polyposis and extra-intestinal tissue tumor. Were desmoid tumors rarely as large as fetus and local aggressively. In our case, we selected surgery to remove the intra-abdominal desmoid tumor after the natural delivery of the fetus and no abnormalities were observed during the 6 months follow-up. Women during pregnancy have an increased risk for the development of desmoid tumors, likely with the sex hormone to be one of the triggers. Therefore, we suggested that when a patient with Gardner syndrome desire to conceive again, they should go to the hospital for a regular review at least once every 3 months."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a very rare disease that has no characteristic image findings, so it is often difficult to differentiate from gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). A case of desmoid-type fibromatosis that was difficult to differentiate from GIST is reported. The decisive factor in the diagnosis was positive nuclear immunostaining for beta-catenin nucleus. Case presentation : A man is his 30s had no significant past medical history, including no abdominal surgery. A medical check-up found a large tumor in the right lateral abdomen. After some examinations, a preoperative diagnosis of GIST was made, and open ileocecal resection was performed. However, the final diagnosis based on the pathological findings was desmoid-type fibromatosis. Conclusions : We should consider desmoid-type fibromatosis when we find a large abdominal mass, but it may be difficult to diagnose based only on imaging findings. Immunohistochemical examination of the specimen may make the diagnosis. J. Med. Invest. 67 : 375-377, August, 2020."
"Desmoid type fibromatosis (DTF) is a rare benign tumor of connective tissue origin. While these tumors are typically not malignant, they can exhibit aggressive growth patterns causing mass effect on surrounding organs. These tumors typically present in the extremities and abdominal wall, rarely occurring in the mesentery, and abdominal organs. Due to the rarity of this tumor and the variable size and origin, it is difficult to provide exact prognosis, recurrence, and treatment efficacy regarding desmoid tumors arising from the ileocolic mesentery. We present a case of a young male with a sporadic 31 x 25 x 12 cm DTF arising from the ileocolic mesentery that was complicated by mass effect on bowel and intra-abdominal organs requiring surgical intervention. On presentation, the patient exhibited weight gain and abdominal pressure. Abdominal distension without tenderness on palpation was noted on physical examination. The tumor biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of DTF. No evidence of familial adenomatous polyposis or Gardner syndrome was identified. The tumor was surgically excised and intimately associated with the bowel requiring ileocolonic resection with primary anastomosis. At 3-months follow up, surveillance MRI showed no residual or recurrent lesion. A multi-disciplinary approach to this patient's diagnosis and treatment allowed for an accurate diagnosis, efficient treatment, and follow up plan."
"Gardner fibroma (GF) is a benign soft-tissue tumor that is associated with Gardner syndrome and can progress to, or co-occur with, desmoid fibromatosis (DF). Herein, we report a unique case of an 11-year-old boy who presented with a rapidly growing soft-tissue mass after biopsy of a stable fat-rich lesion present in the calf muscles since infancy, with Magnetic resonance imaging findings suggesting an intramuscular adipocytic tumor. The resection showed GF and DF. DF arising from a preexisting GF (the so-called ""GF-DF sequence"") is a well-documented phenomenon. Although immunohistochemistry was negative for nuclear beta-catenin expression, a CTTNB1 S45F mutation, which has been associated with aggressive behavior in DF, was identified in both components using a next-generation sequencing-based molecular assay. This is the first time a mutation in CTNNB1 has been identified in GF and the GF-DF sequence, thus expanding our knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of the GF-DF sequence and highlighting the role of molecular testing in pediatric soft-tissue tumors. The histologic findings of an adipocyte-rich intramuscular GF also are unique, expanding the morphological spectrum of GF and adding GF to the differential diagnosis of intramuscular lesions with an adipocytic component."
"Nasal spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma is very rare. The tumor is sometimes confused with other spindle cell tumors. We herein report a case of nasal spindle cell tumor in a 62-year-old woman. The patient first presented herself to a medical doctor's office after an episode of left epistaxis. An intranasal tumor was found and resected. The tumor was composed of spindle cells, and she was diagnosed with desmoid-type fibromatosis. Five years after the initial episode, an intranasal tumor was found again. The tumor showed a fascicular growth pattern with high cellularity and was predominantly composed of spindle cells. Scattered eosinophilic rhabdomyoblasts were also observed. She was diagnosed with spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma. This is a unique case report not only because nasal spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma is very rare but also because the tumor was initially diagnosed as desmoid-type fibromatosis. It is important to consider spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma as a differential diagnosis of nasal spindle cell tumors."
"Mesenteric fibromatosis-desmoid tumor of mesentery is a rare benign soft tissue tumor of mesentery. On CT, it mimics gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). Case Report: A 44-year-old female with small intestinal mass, preoperatively diagnosed radiologically and pathologically as GIST. Conclusion: Mesenteric fibromatosis is a rare tumor often mistaken for GIST. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry is the key as management of both the tumors differs."

"Desmoid fibromatosis (DF) is an aggressive fibroblastic neoplasm with a high propensity for local recurrence. Although multiple therapeutic modalities seem effective for DF, the standard systemic treatment for symptomatic and progressive DF remains controversial. As targeted therapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been recently reported to contribute to the treatment of DF. Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of anlotinib, a novel multi-kinase angiogenesis inhibitor, in patients with DF. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively collected the clinical medical records of patients with extremity DF who received anlotinib between January 2019 and January 2020 in our center. Anlotinib was started with a dose of 8 mg daily and adjusted according to the drug-related toxicity. Tumor response was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 criteria. Progression-free survival (PFS) was identified as the primary endpoint and analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: In total, 21 (6 male, 15 female) consecutive patients with DF were enrolled. The median medication time was nine months (Q1, Q3: 7.5, 10.5). None of the patients achieved a complete response, but eight (38.1%) patients achieved a partial response and ten patients (47.6%) achieved disease stability. Three (14%) patients developed progressive disease and the 3-, 6-, and 12-month PFS rates were 95.2%, 90.5%, and 84.0%, respectively. The disease control rate was 86.0% (18/21) and the objective response rate was 38.1% (8/21). Moreover, 15/21 (71.4%) patients achieved a reduction in tumor size, accompanied with a decrease in T2-weighted signal intensity on magnetic resonance imaging and clinical benefit. Conclusion: Anlotinib was effective against DF with an acceptable safety profile, and significantly slowed the disease progression. Further, multicenter studies with a longer follow-up time are needed to characterize fully the clinical application of anlotinib in DF."

"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is a tumor with high local recurrence rate. Sixteen patients (18 desmoid tumors) were retrospectively evaluated. Initial surgery was performed in 13/18 tumors, with complete resection in 6 (one with free margin and five with microscopic residual disease); 10/13 had local relapse. Eleven patients with 13 tumors underwent treatment with methotrexate-vinblastine. The response rate to chemotherapy was 54%, and up to 81% if stable disease cases were included. The best response was partial remission. Only 2 had grade 4 toxicity. Twelve of 15 patients had sequelae. In 8 cases sequelae were directly related to the surgical intervention and 3 of them were severe. The 5-year progression-free survival and overall survival were 30% and 93.3%, respectively. DF has a high local relapse rate, regardless of surgical margin involvement. Low dose chemotherapy achieved stable disease and even remission of the lesions with low toxicity. The high rate of sequelae is probably related to the initial surgery performed in the majority of patients and may be avoided by the use of neoadjuvant low dose chemotherapy."
"Gitelman syndrome is a rare, recessively inherited disease characterized by chronic hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia as a result of defective electrolyte co-transport at the level of the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney. Here, we present the first report of a patient with Gitelman syndrome who developed multiple neoplasia including colorectal polyposis, synchronous colorectal cancers, recurrent breast fibroadenomata and a desmoid tumor. Whole-exome sequencing confirmed germline compound heterozygous mutations of c.179C > T and c.1326C > G in SLC12A3, and in addition, identified a monoallelic germline c.934-2A > G splice site mutation in MUTYH. In vitro, magnesium deficiency potentiated oxidative DNA damage in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from the same patient. We postulate that monoallelic MUTYH mutations may manifest in the presence of cooperative non-genetic mechanisms, in this case possibly magnesium deficiency from Gitelman syndrome."
"Desmoid tumors (DTs) are a rare disease of intermediate malignancy characterized histologically by a locally aggressive, monoclonal, fibroblastic proliferation and clinically by a variable and often unpredictable course. For decades, surgical resection has been the standard initial treatment approach; however, more recently, a paradigm shift toward a more conservative treatment strategy has been introduced. More than 5 years ago, The Desmoid Tumor Working Group started a consensus initiative in Europe with the aim of harmonizing the strategy among clinicians and setting up treatment recommendations for patients with DTs. This review summarizes the latest joint, global, evidence-based guideline approach to DT management. Moreover, a number of gray areas in the treatment recommendations are discussed, and possible future perspectives on the treatment armamentarium for patients with DTs are presented."
"Pancreas is an exceptionally rare location for desmoid tumors. There are very few case reports of pancreatic fibromatosis in the English radiology literature. We present a case of a 45-year-old male with a mixed solid and cystic desmoid tumor of the pancreas which was surgically resected and was followed by recurrence in the mesentery. This will be the first case report of pancreatic desmoid with documented recurrence of fibromatosis in the mesentery which was also surgically resected and confirmed on pathology. In this case report, we discuss this entity's radiological findings with pathology correlation, clinical findings and management along with literature review."
"OBJECTIVE. The response of desmoid tumors (DTs) to chemotherapy is evaluated with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) in daily practice and clinical trials. MRI shows early change in heterogeneity in responding tumors due to a decrease in cellular area and an increase in fibronecrotic content before dimensional response. Heterogeneity can be quantified with radiomics. Our aim was to develop radiomics-based response criteria and to compare their performances with clinical and radiologic response criteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Forty-two patients (median age, 38.2 years) were included in this retrospective multicenter study because they presented with progressive DT and had an MRI examination at baseline, which we refer to as ""MRI-0,"" and an early MRI evaluation performed after the first chemotherapy cycle (mean time after first chemotherapy cycle, 3 months [SD, 28 days]), which we refer to as ""MRI-1."" After signal intensity normalization, voxel size standardization, discretization, and segmentation of DT volume on fat-suppressed contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging, 90 baseline and delta 3D radiomics features were extracted. Using cross-validation and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-penalized Cox regression, a radiomics score was generated. The performances of models based on the radiomics score, modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria, Cheson criteria, Choi criteria, and revised Choi criteria from MRI-0 to MRI-1 to predict progression-free survival (PFS, as defined by RECIST 1.1) were assessed with the concordance index. The results were adjusted for performance status, tumor volume, prior chemotherapy, current chemotherapy, and beta-catenin mutation. RESULTS. There were 10 cases of progression. The radiomics score included four variables. A high score indicated a poor prognosis. The radiomics score independently correlated with PFS (adjusted hazard ratio = 5.60, p = 0.003), and none of the usual response criteria independently correlated with PFS. The prognostic model based on the radiomics score had the highest concordance index (0.84; 95% CI, 0.71-0.96). CONCLUSION. Quantifying early changes in heterogeneity through a dedicated radiomics score could improve response evaluation for patients with DT undergoing chemotherapy."

"adipocytic tumors (lipoma, lipoblastoma, and liposarcoma), fibroblastic/myofibroblastic tumors (nodular fasciitis, myositis ossificans, fibrous hamartoma of infancy, fibromatosis colli, desmoid-type fibromatosis, lipofibromatosis, and infantile fibrosarcoma), pericytic tumors (myofibroma/myofibromatosis), skeletal muscle tumor (rhabdomyosarcoma), nerve sheath tumors (neurofibroma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor), and uncertain differentiation (synovial sarcoma). In general, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging are used as first- and second-line imaging modalities, with limited roles for plain radiographs, computed tomography, and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. Many of these tumors have nonspecific imaging findings although there are some key imaging clues that in conjunction with the clinical information allow a specific diagnosis or a narrow differential diagnosis. However, in many instances, histology is required for final diagnosis."
"Diagnosing desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) requires an invasive tissue biopsy with beta-catenin staining and CTNNB1 mutational analysis, and is challenging due to its rarity. The aim of this study was to evaluate radiomics for distinguishing DTF from soft tissue sarcomas (STS), and in DTF, for predicting the CTNNB1 mutation types. METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed extremity STS (non-DTF) or DTF and at least a pretreatment T1-weighted (T1w) MRI scan were retrospectively included. Tumors were semi-automatically annotated on the T1w scans, from which 411 features were extracted. Prediction models were created using a combination of various machine learning approaches. Evaluation was performed through a 100x random-split cross-validation. The model for DTF vs. non-DTF was compared to classification by two radiologists on a location matched subset. RESULTS: The data included 203 patients (72 DTF, 131 STS). The T1w radiomics model showed a mean AUC of 0.79 on the full dataset. Addition of T2w or T1w post-contrast scans did not improve the performance. On the location matched cohort, the T1w model had a mean AUC of 0.88 while the radiologists had an AUC of 0.80 and 0.88, respectively. For the prediction of the CTNNB1 mutation types (S45F, T41A and wild-type), the T1w model showed an AUC of 0.61, 0.56, and 0.74. CONCLUSIONS: Our radiomics model was able to distinguish DTF from STS with high accuracy similar to two radiologists, but was not able to predict the CTNNB1 mutation status."
"Musculoskeletal fibromatoses represent a wide spectrum of fibroblastic and myofibroblastic neoplasms with similar pathologic appearances and variable clinical behavior. These lesions are categorized by location (superficial or deep). Deep fibromatosis in adults is divided into desmoid and abdominal wall type. Desmoid-type fibromatosis typically manifests as a deeply seated but poorly circumscribed soft-tissue mass. Slow insidious growth is common, and lesions are usually painless. It occurs most frequently in patients in the 2nd-4th decades of life, with a peak incidence between the ages of 25 and 35 years. Overall, the disease has a female predilection. Case Report: Herein, we present the case of a 78-year-old man who developed a gradually progressive painless swelling over the right side of the neck over a period of 6 months. The patient was planned for a magnetic resonance imaging scan which showed ill-defined lobulated mass in the right trapezius of size 4 x 7 x 5.4 cm, which was heterogeneous in T2, isointense in T1, multiple ovoid calcifications, and was suspected with cysticercosis or fibroma. Open biopsy was done a week later which was suggestive of fibromatosis. The patient underwent definitive resection of the tumor 1 week later and the tumor was found to be restricted to the muscular plane. Histology was consistent with fibromatosis, the specimen being positive for vimentin, beta-catenin, and smooth muscle actin. The patient was on serial follow-ups and the last follow-up, 3 year later did not show any signs of recurrence of the tumor. Conclusion: This case report is being presented to highlight the radiological differential of cysticercosis in a patient with muscular fibroma, extremely rare presentation of fibromatosis of the trapezius in the 7th decade."
sporadic or hereditary (associated with familial adenomatous polyposis and Gardner syndrome). The diagnosis of desmoid-type tumors is based on imaging modalities and histopathological examination. The primary treatment is resection surgery. We report a 64-year-old male with a distal pancreatic desmoid tumor. We focus on tumor management by the application of radiological modalities and pathological analysis.

"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF), also called desmoid tumor, is an uncommon soft-tissue neoplasm. Characteristically, it expands locally without metastatic potential. However, its tendency of relapse after curative resections has been well documented. Effective treatment options have been limited and there is a clear need for novel treatment strategies. Methods: We used combination therapy including multikinase tyrosine kinase inhibitor for treating AF. Results: We presented a case of an extra-abdominal AF who was successfully treated with meloxicam and sorafenib combination in our clinic. She tolerated this therapy well with only mild side effects. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of an extra-abdominal AF with a major partial response to sorafenib and meloxicam combination. Conclusion: Due to the favorable toxicity profile of sorafenib and meloxicam, this combination might be an effective treatment option for patients with locally aggressive and inoperable AF."
"Gardner syndrome (GS) is a form of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and is characterized by colonic polyposis, osteomas, and soft-tissue tumors. Desmoid tumors (DT) are lesions of mesenchymal origin and are an extra-colonic manifestation of GS. Gardner-associated fibroma (GAF) is considered to be a benign soft-tissue lesion related to DT and FAP. Here we present a case of an 18-year-old female patient with a huge lump in her right thoracic cavity and another lump located in her left lumbar muscles who was diagnosed with GS through a colonoscopy and through adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutation detection. The patient underwent a surgical resection of the right thoracic tumor. Three months later, the left waist lump underwent medical treatment with tamoxifen and celecoxib and was monitored using computed tomography (CT). Subsequently, colonoscopy screening was performed annually to prevent colorectal cancer. GAF is frequent in GS, and such a huge GAP in the thorax is very rare, with few cases reported in the literature. Patients with GS must be closely monitored, and clinical and imaging examinations must be performed to detect any signs of tumors."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is a rare neoplasm characterized by fibroblastic and myofibroblastic proliferation. While characterized as a benign lesion that does not metastasize, desmoid-type fibromatosis exhibits a wide range of behavior from aggressive local tissue invasion and post-surgical recurrence to spontaneous regression. Tumor regression can occur following systemic medical therapy or rarely may occur in the absence of therapy. We present a case of a 50-year-old female with a left thigh vastus medialis intramuscular mass which underwent imaging work-up and subsequent core needle ultrasound-guided biopsy showing results of desmoid-type fibromatosis. Following biopsy, the tumor showed prompt, complete regression with complete MRI resolution 2 months following biopsy. The patient showed no evidence of disease recurrence out to one year on MRI surveillance. This case report will discuss desmoid-type fibromatosis imaging features, treatment strategies, spectrum of disease behavior, and atypical behavior such as the spontaneous tumor regression as seen in this case report. To our knowledge there have been no reported cases of DF spontaneous regression 2 months following a core needle biopsy. Understanding the variable behavior of desmoid-type fibromatosis can assist the radiologist in guiding management of these lesions with the goal of optimizing clinical outcomes and preventing unnecessary aggressive treatments for stable or regressing disease."
"Desmoid type fibromatosis is a benign neoplastic process non-encapsulated locally invasive and aggressive, which arises from a proliferation of bland-looking fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. The most frequent location of fibromatosis is extraabdominal (60%), abdominal wall (25%) and intra-abdominal (8-15%), rarely can originate in the viscera (0.73%), such as the pancreas, gastroesophageal junction, diaphragm and appendix. The annual incidence of desmoid tumor is estimated at 2 to 5 cases per million. In this article, we report a case of unusual presentation, originated in the cecal appendix. CASE: A 41-year-old female patient with acute pelvic pain, admitted to surgical ward with a clinical and ultrasound diagnosis of probably ovarian pedicle tumor. An explorative laparotomy revealed a solid mass of 15 cm in diameter arising from the cecal appendix, with the anatomopathological study corresponding to a desmoid tumor of the cecal appendix. CONCLUSIONS: The desmoid tumor can arise from several extra and intra-abdominal locations, the latter being the rarest and most aggressive. Accurate preoperative diagnosis is very difficult and almost always patients enter to surgery with suspected diagnosis of intraabdominal tumor of unknown etiology. The risk factors associated to its appearance are not yet characterized. The complete surgical resection of the tumor -with free surgical margins (R0)- is the treatment of choice; however, the risk of recurrence is high even with optimal tumor removal."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) are locally aggressive neoplasms, with a need for effective systemic treatment in case of progression to avoid the short- and long-term complications of local treatments. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of adult patients with DF treated with oral vinorelbine (90 mg once weekly) at Gustave Roussy Cancer Institute (Villejuif, Paris, France). Only patients with documented progressive disease according to RECIST v1.1 for more than 3 months (+/-2 weeks) before treatment initiation were included. RESULTS: From 2009 to 2019, 90 out of 438 patients with DF were eligible for this analysis. Vinorelbine was given alone in 56 patients (62%), or concomitantly with endocrine therapy in 34 patients, for a median duration of 6.7 months. A partial response was observed in 29% and stable disease in another 57%. With a median follow-up of 52.4 months, the median time to treatment failure (TTF) was not reached. Progression-free rates at 6 and 12 months were 88.7% and 77.5%, respectively. Concomitant endocrine therapy was associated with longer TTF in women [HR, 2.16; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06-4.37; P = 0.03). Among 64 patients with documented CTNNB1 mutational status, p.S45F or p.S45P mutations were associated with longer TTF compared with p.T41A or wild-type tumors (HR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.23-6.27; P = 0.04). Toxicity profile was favorable, without grade 3-4 toxicity, except for one grade 3 neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: Oral vinorelbine is an effective, affordable, and well-tolerated regimen in patients with advanced, progressive DF. Prolonged activity was observed in patients with tumors harboring CTNNB1 p.S45F or p.S45P mutations."
"Intra-abdominal desmoid fibromatosis (also known as desmoid tumor) is a rare benign but often locally aggressive infiltrative fibrous proliferation. Pancreatic desmoid fibromatosis is even rarer, with only 31 cases previously reported in the English-language literature. These tumors present a distinct diagnostic challenge due to their rarity and non-specific image findings and presentation, with most cases diagnosed as desmoid fibromatosis only after surgical resection. This report presents a rare case of pancreatic desmoid fibromatosis in a 72 year old man, who on a follow-up CT for a previously diagnosed angiomyolipoma of the kidney was found to have a 4.0 cm pancreatic tail mass. This was sampled pre-operatively by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA). Examination of the cytology material showed a low-grade spindle cell lesion. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) performed on FNA cell block showed the lesional cells to be positive for beta-catenin, consistent with fibromatosis. Additional mutational analysis on cell block material revealed the characteristic CTNNB1 gene mutation (T41A), confirming the diagnosis. The mass was then surgically resected and again confirmed to be desmoid fibromatosis on histopathologic examination. On review of previously published cases of pancreatic desmoid fibromatosis, most were initially suspected to be some type of pancreatic neoplasm and were not biopsied prior to surgical resection. This case suggests a potential key role for fine-needle aspiration cytology in the preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic and other intra-abdominal desmoid tumors, particularly as evidence emerges that non-surgical treatment may be a viable first option for some cases."
"Desmoid-Type Fibromatosis (DTF) is a rare mesenchymal neoplasm with a locally invasive pattern and high risk of local recurrence after surgery. Historically, the standard treatment for DTF was surgical resection. However, considering the difficulty of achieving surgical eradication, the possible unnecessary morbidity and the unpredictability of the natural history, a wait-and-see approach has been proposed for asymptomatic DTF. METHODS: We analyzed 87 consecutive patients with histologically-proven sporadic primary DTF, first recurrence or residual disease managed at our institution between 2000 and 2018. Patients and tumor-related variables were reviewed and analyzed. Two different treatment strategies were adopted according to different time periods: in the ""early period"" (2000-2010) patients underwent surgical treatment irrespective of the clinical presentation, whereas in the ""late period"" (2012-2018) asymptomatic patients used to undergo a wait-and-see strategy. The event-free survival (EFS) was compared trough a pre-post comparison. RESULTS: In the early period, surgery was performed in 51 (94.4%) patients and watchful waiting in 3 (5.6%). In the late period, the watchful waiting group accounted for 24 (72.7%) patients and the surgical group for 9 (27.3%). No statistically independent prognostic factors were found. EFS did not show statistically significant differences between early and late period groups. CONCLUSION: Wait-and-see policy has shown to be equivalent to upfront surgery in terms of EFS; therefore, a conservative approach is recommended in asymptomatic patients diagnosed with DTF that can be followed through watchful waiting."
"Desmoid tumors are slowly growing neoplasms that arise from fibroblasts. These tumors are locally aggressive and have a high rate of recurrence after surgery. Pancreatic desmoid tumors are extremely rare. The indications and outcomes of laparoscopic surgery for pancreatic desmoid tumors have not been fully elucidated. This report therefore aimed to describe a rare case of a pancreatic desmoid tumor in a patient who was successfully treated with laparoscopic spleen-preserving pancreatic resection. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a case of a 60-year-old man who presented with back pain. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan revealed a circumscribed tumor in the pancreatic tail measuring 3 cm. The patient underwent laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy. Pathological analysis revealed a desmoid tumor infiltrating the pancreatic parenchyma. There was no evidence of recurrence at 36 months of follow-up. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Isolated sporadic pancreatic desmoid tumors are extremely rare. Laparoscopic radical resection could be a safe and effective treatment for this benign but locally aggressive tumor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report a patient with a pancreatic desmoid tumor who was successfully treated with laparoscopic surgery."
"Low-dose methotrexate (MTX) plus vinblastine (VBL) chemotherapy is an effective treatment for desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF). However, previous reports have described a weekly regimen, with no reports available on a biweekly one. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical outcomes of a biweekly regimen in a cohort prospectively treated in our single institution. Since 2010, we have prospectively treated refractory DF patients with biweekly MTX (30 mg/m(2) ) + VBL (6 mg/m(2) ). Efficacy, progression-free survival (PFS), and correlating factors were analyzed. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded. In total, 38 patients received low-dose MTX + VBL therapy, and its efficacy was assessed in 37 of them. Nineteen (51%) patients showed partial response (PR). Clinical benefit rate was 95%. PFS at 5 y was 80.8%. In PR cases, median time to response was 10 mo. Longer duration of therapy was significantly associated with the response of PR (P = .007) by univariate analysis. There was no clear association between various clinicopathological factors, including tumor size, location, catenin beta-1 (CTNNB1) mutation status with effect. Only 3 AEs of grade 3/4 were observed. Tumor regrowth after MTX + VBL discontinuation was observed in 5 (20%) of 25 patients. Biweekly administration of MTX + VBL chemotherapy was well tolerated compared with weekly administration, and its efficacy was anticipated in DF patents, although the time needed to achieve a response may be relatively long. The treatment interval should be determined taking into account both the condition of the tumor and the patient's preference."
"Desmoid tumors, also called <<agressive fibromatosis>>, are rare soft tissue tumors, locally invasives with a high recurrence tendency but non metastatic. They arise mainly in people with sporadic somatic CTNNB1 gene mutation or with history of trauma, surgery or during pregnancy. These tumors are often extra-abdominal but may also develop in the abdominal wall or, more rarely, in the mesentery or retroperitoneum. It is hard to distinguish local malignancy recurrence with another type of tumor such as desmoid tumor during the follow-up of intra-abdominal resected malignancy. Even if rare, desmoid tumors must be part of the differencial diagnosis, a fortiori in the context of a surgical history. Clinical behavior, high potential of local invasion and recurrency risk of the tumor must be at the center of the therapeutic decision. A conservative approach is totally justified at the price of a close clinical and radiological follow-up."
"non-neoplastic and neoplastic. Common non-neoplastic mesenteric diseases include those involving the mesenteric vasculature and those of inflammatory processes. Mesenteric inflammatory processes can mimic a neoplastic process. Neoplastic diseases of the mesentery are rare. Generally, the morphology, behavior and diagnostic criteria for mesenteric tumors are similar to their soft tissue or organ-specific counterparts. Their recognition can be challenging because they sometimes are overlooked in differential diagnoses."
a complete response (Case 1); a partial response (Case 2); stable disease (Case 3). The fourth had disease progression after a partial response. No patient experienced grade 3 or 4 adverse events.
"Conventional ultrasound is the main imaging modality in obstetrics for assessing the maternal and fetal status. Up to date, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has not found widespread use in gynecology and obstetrics, but recent studies demonstrate promising results. The aim of the present study is to assess safe and valuable application of CEUS during pregnancy to investigate non-obstetric conditions. METHODS: Five pregnant patients on whom CEUS was performed between 2019 and 2020 were included in this retrospective single-center study. A total of six CEUS examinations were performed including one CEUS-guided biopsy (mean age: 31 years, mean weeks of pregnancy: 18 weeks). CEUS examinations were performed by a consultant radiologist (EFSUMB level 3). RESULTS: All included pregnant women safely underwent CEUS. Neither maternal nor fetal adverse effects were detected. CEUS critically helped in the diagnostic workup of a desmoid tumor of the abdominal wall, hepatic hemangioma, amebic hepatic abscess, uncomplicated renal cyst and post-inflammatory alteration of the renal cortex and for excluding active abdominal bleeding. In addition, CEUS-guided biopsy was performed to prevent intratumoral hemorrhage. Findings from CEUS prompted immediate treatment in two women, whereas in three women regular obstetric monitoring of the women could be conducted. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate safe and crucial application of off-label CEUS in pregnant women to assess different non-obstetric conditions allowing to prevent additional ionizing CT or application of (gadolinium-based) contrast agent in MRI. Hence, CEUS might add pivotal value for evaluating obstetric and non-obstetric conditions and thereby directing clinical management of pregnant women in the future."
"Cryoablation (CA) has gained popularity in the treatment of benign and malignant musculoskeletal tumors. While extra-abdominal desmoid (EAD) tumors are not malignant, they remain challenging to treat because of their high local recurrence rate. We reviewed all EAD tumors treated with CA at our institution between November 2012 and March 2020. Fourteen procedures were performed on nine females and one male (mean age, 33 +/- 18 years) as either first-line (n = 4) or salvage therapy (n = 6) with curative intent (n = 8) or tumor debulking (n = 2). Mean tumor size was 63.6 cm(3) (range, 3.4-169 cm(3)). Contrast-enhanced MRI was performed before treatment and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Treatment outcome was based on the change in enhanced tumor volume (ET-V). For curatively treated patients, the mean ET-V change was -97 +/- 7%, -44 +/- 143%, and +103 +/- 312% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. For debulking patients, the mean ET-V change was -98 +/- 4%, +149 +/- 364%, and +192 +/- 353% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. During a mean follow-up of 53.7 months (range, 12-83 months), one grade III and one grade IV complication were noted. We found CA to be safe and well tolerated in patients with EAD."
"10 lesions involved the superficial fascia system including four lesions additionally involving the deep fascia and pectoralis major, and 12 lesions were inside the glandular parenchyma with two lesions originated from the prior surgery site. The detection rates of mammography, ultrasound, and MRI for breast fibromatosis were 33.3% (3/9), 90% (18/20), and 100% (3/3), respectively. We found that fascia involvement may be a characteristic of breast fibromatosis. The lesion located inside glandular parenchyma is prone to be underestimated, whereas combined MR with ultrasound is recommended for the diagnosis. The complete excision with negative margins is important for a good prognosis."
"The abdominal desmoid tumor shows invasive development and high local recurrence rate. The primary treatment method is complete removal of the tumor because of the high recurrence rate; however, the problem for the surgeon is the reconstruction of the abdominal wall after resection of the abdominal desmoid tumor. Case Presentation: A 63-year-old man underwent open drainage and ileostomy for the perforation of ileocecal tumor. After 3 months, he underwent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy closure. Pathological examination revealed no malignancy, and the ileocecal tumor showed the presence of abscess. He noticed a palpable mass in the left abdomen. Enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a large abdominal incisional hernia and an enhanced mass of 40 mm in the left rectus muscle. Needle biopsy was performed and the diagnosis was desmoid tumor. He underwent resection of the desmoid tumor and repair of hernia. We performed wide local resection, with a 2-cm surgical margin. The hernia was repaired by simple closure, and the defect in the left abdomen was repaired with reconstruction using the fascia lata patch through plastic surgery. Conclusion: We encountered a case of abdominal wall desmoid tumor combined with a large abdominal incisional hernia. We selected the use of autologous fascia based on the risk of recurrence. The patient has not shown recurrence of incisional hernia or desmoid tumor 22 months after surgery. The use of fascia lata patch can be considered as a satisfactory alternative for such reconstruction cases."
"The desmoid tumor is a locally aggressive proliferative disease within the family of soft-tissue sarcomas. Despite its relatively good prognosis, the clinical management of desmoid tumors requires constant multidisciplinary evaluation due to its highly variable clinical behavior. Recently, active surveillance has being regarded as the appropriate strategy at diagnosis, as indolent persistence or spontaneous regressions are not uncommon. Here, we review the most recent advances in desmoid tumor therapy, including low-dose chemotherapy and treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We also explore the recent improvements in our knowledge of the molecular biology of this disease, which are leading to clinical trials with targeted agents."
"Abdominal wall endometriosis (AWE) in young women, with previous gynecological abdominal surgery, is the first condition considered by many practitioners when a tumor in the region of the scar appears. AWE seems to be caused by an iatrogenic transfer of endometrial cells at the level of the scar. The onset of the disease may be late in many cases. Despite the fact that the disease could be totally asymptomatic, there are certain risk factors that can be identified during the anamnesis, such as: heredity, menarche at the age of >14 years, menstrual cycle <27 days, delayed menopause, excessive alcohol and caffeine consumption. Suggestive signs include cyclic or continuous abdominal pain caused by a palpable abdominal wall mass with a maximum tenderness in the region of the surgical scar. The differential diagnosis is complex and rare entities like desmoid tumors (DTs) must be taken into consideration. Desmoid tumor, or the so-called aggressive fibromatosis (AF), is a rare fibroblastic proliferation. This tumor can develop in any muscular aponeurotic structure of the body and is considered benign but with a high recurrence rate. DTs can cause local infiltration, subsequently producing certain levels of deformity and potential obstruction of vital structures and organs. The differential diagnosis is challenging in this situations, the imagery exams are useful, especially in detecting the precise location of the tumor. The histological examination of the tumor can state the final and precise diagnosis."
"This study evaluates the results of the active surveillance (AS) approach in adult patients with desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) because AS is advocated as a front-line approach for DTF in the European consensus guidelines. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted (December 19th, 2019, updated on April 14th, 2020). Studies describing the outcomes of the AS approach were included. The PRISMA guidelines were used. RESULTS: Twenty-five articles were included for data retrieval. Forty-two percent of reported patients (1480 of 3527 patients) received AS, the majority were women and the majority had a primary tumour. The median age at diagnosis ranged from 28 to 59 years. Common tumour sites were the extremities/girdles (n = 273), the abdominal wall (n = 253) and the trunk (n = 153). The median reported percentage of progressive disease, stable disease and partial response was 20% (interquartile range [IQR]: 13-35%), 59% (IQR: 37-69%) and 19% (IQR 3-23%), respectively. In 640 patients, the outcome was not specified. The median reported percentage of shifting to an active form of treatment was 29%, most commonly to systemic treatment (n = 195) and surgery (n = 107). The reported median follow-up time ranged between 8 and 73 months. The reported median time to progression and/or initiation of the subgroup shifting from AS to 'active' therapy ranged from 6.3 months to 19.7 months. CONCLUSION: The majority of patients undergoing AS have either stable disease or a partial response, and about one-third of patients shift to an active form of treatment. Selecting patients who will benefit from active surveillance upfront should be the priority of future studies."

"Desmoid tumor also called aggressive fibromatosis is a rare type of benign tumor. It is a mesenchymal malignancy without metastatic potential. The standard management is resection, but other options including observation may be discussed. Desmoid-type fibromatosis may occur throughout the body, but the abdominal wall is the most common site. The aim of our study was to assess the clinicoepidemiological profile, prognostic factors, and treatment outcome of desmoid tumors. Methods: A monocentric retrospective study was conducted over a period of 19 years between February 2000 and November 2019 at the oncology department of Salah Azaiz Institute. Our study concerns 30 patients with desmoid tumor. All data regarding patients were obtained from the medical record. Results: Thirty patients were included. The median age was 35 years with a female predominance (sex ratio = 0.07). A palpable mass was the most common complaint (n = 27). Median tumor size was 5 cm. The principal site of involvement was the abdominal wall (n = 14). Surgery was performed in 27 patients. The histopathology reports listed 14 (52%) cases with negative margins and 13 (48%) cases with positive margins. Radiation therapy was performed in 2 patients. One patient received tamoxifen. Local recurrence occurred in 11 patients. Two patients died of their desmoid tumor. Abdominal wall tumors have less risk of recurrence compared with other sites (p=0.047). Macroscopic margin involvement (R2) was the only prognostic factor influencing disease-free-survival (p=0.034). Conclusion: Desmoid tumors are aggressive tumors with a tendency for local recurrence. Abdominal wall tumors have less risk of recurrence. Macroscopic margin involvement was the only prognostic factor that affects disease-free-survival."
"Cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the standard of care first-line treatment for advanced and metastatic soft-tissue sarcomas (STSs). Certain patients may not be chemotherapy candidates based upon age or co-morbidities, leaving limited treatment options. Pazopanib is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is FDA-approved for metastatic STS after the first line. We proposed a phase II study evaluating pazopanib as a first-line agent in patients with advanced disease who are deemed not to be candidates for chemotherapy. METHODS: Eligible patients were at least 18 years old, not candidates for chemotherapyand were treatment naive. Pazopanib was titrated from 200 mg twice daily to a goal of 800 mg daily. The primary end point was the clinical benefit rate (CBR) (CBR = completed response + partial response + stable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours [RECIST 1.1]) at 16 weeks. The sample size of 56 evaluable patients was calculated to provide 80% power to test a hypothesised CBR of >/=35% against an unfavourable CBR of </=20%. If >/= 17 patients achieved benefit, the null CBR of 20% would be rejected at a nominal 5% alpha level. Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), quality of life and serum biomarkers. FINDINGS: Fifty-six patients were enrolled from May 2015 to February 2019 and are included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Median PFS was 3.67 (2.62-7.25) months. Median OS was 14.16 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.4-NR) months, CBR = 39.29% (22/56) (CI = 0.265-0.533, p = 0.0007). No new or unexpected adverse events were seen. The most common grade I-II events were diarrhoea, nausea and fatigue. The most common grade III-IV events were hypertension and liver function test abnormalities. INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that there is a benefit to front-line pazopanib in patients with STS who are not candidates for cytotoxic chemotherapy."
"Pathological femoral fracture (PFF) after radiation therapy (RT) for soft tissue tumor is a debilitating complication with a high rate of nonunion that requires multiple subsequent procedures and hindrance of functional activity. We aimed to evaluate healing rate after repeated internal fixation in a case series of PFF after RT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who had PFF after RT and were treated at our center between 2007 and 2018. We analyzed our surgical protocols and fracture healing rate. INTERPRETATION: We identified and analyzed a total of seven patients (six females and one male) whose mean age at fracture was 58 years. Primary tumors consisted of soft tissue sarcoma (n = 5), melanoma (n = 1), and desmoid tumor (n = 1). All primary tumors were treated with surgical excision and adjuvant RT. The mean follow-up duration after fracture was 33 months (range, 16-58). At the last follow-up, five out of seven fractures had completely healed, and two lesions showed delayed union at 15 and 16 months, respectively. Among the five complete unions, one fracture was healed after the first fixation. The remaining four lesions were treated with second internal fixation due to nonunion/metal failure or delayed union. The mean time to radiologic healing after the last fixation was 6.8 months (range, 5-8). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that bones within the RT field retain healing capacities, and that repeated internal fixation may be a viable option for the treatment of PFF after RT."
"The treatment modality for desmoid-type fibromatosis has shifted from surgery to conservative treatment. The guideline committee for clinical care of extra-abdominal desmoid-type fibromatosis in Japan conducted a systematic review of treatment with doxorubicin-based chemotherapy for desmoid-type fibromatosis. METHODS: We searched the pertinent literature. Two reviewers evaluated and screened it independently for eligibility and extracted data. They rated each report according to the grading of recommendations development and evaluation methodology. Based on the 'body of evidence', which the reviewers created, the clinical guideline committee decided a recommendation for the clinical question, 'Is doxorubicin-based chemotherapy effective for patients with extra-abdominal desmoid-type fibromatosis?' RESULTS: Fifty-three articles were extracted by the literature search, and one from hand search. After the first and second screenings, five articles were subjected to the final evaluation. There were no randomized controlled trials. According to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors criteria, the response rates of doxorubicin-based regimens and liposomal doxorubicin were 44% (28.6-54) and 33.3% (0-75) on average, respectively. In two reports, the response rates of doxorubicin-based regimens were higher than those of non-doxorubicin-based ones; 54% vs 12%, 40% vs 11%, respectively. The rates of G3 or G4 complications according to common terminology criteria for adverse events were 28% and 13% with doxorubicin-based and liposomal doxorubicin chemotherapy, respectively, including neutropenia or cardiac dysfunction. None of the reports addressed the issue of QOL. CONCLUSION: Although the evidence level was low in the evaluated studies, doxorubicin-based and liposomal doxorubicin chemotherapy was observed to be effective. However, doxorubicin-based chemotherapy is associated with non-ignorable adverse events, and is not covered by insurance in Japan. We weakly recommend doxorubicin-based chemotherapy for patients with extra-abdominal desmoid-type fibromatosis in cases resistant to other treatments."

"Desmoid tumors represent a rare entity of monoclonal origin characterized by locally aggressive behavior and inability to metastasize. Most cases present in a sporadic pattern and are characterized by a mutation in the CTNNB1 gene; while 5-15% show a hereditary pattern associated with APC gene mutation, both resulting in abnormal beta-catenin accumulation within the cell. The most common sites of presentation are the extremities and the thoracic wall, whereas FAP associated cases present intra-abdominally or in the abdominal wall. Histopathological diagnosis is mandatory, and evaluation is guided with imaging studies ranging from ultrasound, computed tomography or magnetic resonance. Current approaches advocate for an initial active surveillance period due to the stabilization and even regression capacity of desmoid tumors. For progressive, symptomatic, or disabling cases, systemic treatment, radiotherapy or surgery may be used. This is a narrative review of this uncommon disease; we present current knowledge about molecular pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment."
"Signaling pathways have a key role in driving the uncontrolled development of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)- associated and sporadic desmoid tumors (DTs). The relationship between the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway and DTs has been extensively studied, but no reliable biomarkers able to detect their histological subtype have been identified for the accurate diagnosis. In this study we studied the differences in miRNA expression between sporadic (20 patients) and FAP-associated DTs (7 patients) using microarray confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The analysis showed 19 dysregulated miRNAs. Among them miR-133b levels were significantly lower in FAP-associated DT than in sporadic DT. Therefore, two mRNAs, associated to miR-133b and beta-catenin expression, the SIRT1 and ELAVL1were analyzed. The qPCR analysis showed that SIRT1 mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated in FAP-associated DT than in sporadic DT, whereas no differences in ELAVL1 expression was observed between these two DT types. In addition, a negative correlation was observed between miR-133b and SIRT1 in FAP-associated DTs, but not in sporadic DTs. The miR-133b-SIRT1-beta-catenin axis may represent a novel mechanism underlying progression of FAP-associated DT."
"Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is one of the key cascades regulating embryogenesis and tissue homeostasis; it has also been intimately associated with carcinogenesis. This pathway is deregulated in several tumors, including colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and desmoid tumors. It has been shown that CTNNB1 exon 3 mutations are associated with an aggressive phenotype in several of these tumor types and may be associated with therapeutic tolerance. Desmoid tumors typically have a stable genome with beta-catenin mutations as a main feature, making these tumors an ideal model to study the changes associated with different types of beta-catenin mutations. Here, we show that the apoptosis mechanism is deregulated in beta-catenin S45F mutants, resulting in decreased induction of apoptosis in these cells. Our findings also demonstrate that RUNX3 plays a pivotal role in the inhibition of apoptosis found in the beta-catenin S45F mutants. Restoration of RUNX3 overcomes this inhibition in the S45F mutants, highlighting it as a potential therapeutic target for malignancies harboring this specific CTNNB1 mutation. While the regulatory effect of RUNX3 in beta-catenin is already known, our results suggest the possibility of a feedback loop involving these two genes, with the CTNNB1 S45F mutation downregulating expression of RUNX3, thus providing additional possible novel therapeutic targets for tumors having deregulated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling induced by this mutation."
"Mesenteric fibromatosis is a benign locally-aggressive mesenchymal neoplasm that lacks the potential for metastasis. It is related to Gardner's Syndrome, previous trauma, abdominal surgery, and prolonged intake of oestrogen. Differentially diagnosing this from similar tumours is crucial in order for establishing the appropriate treatment and only immunohistochemical features can be used for a definitive diagnosis. Although medical therapies play a role in the treatment of mesenteric fibromatosis, surgical resection is the gold-standard procedure. METHODS: Our case study is a 40-year-old male with a concomitant diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and mesenteric fibromatosis, not associated with any of the risk factors mentioned above. We performed CT and PET scans and observed a vascularised and well-defined mesenteric centre-abdominal hypermetabolic solid mass in contact with the gastric body, duodenum, body and tail of the pancreas, transverse colon, and spleen. An ultrasound-guided tru-cut biopsy revealed features suggestive of mesenteric fibromatosis. RESULTS: An elective laparotomy was carried out and a giant mass, arising from mesentery, was excised, including a partial gastrectomy and segmental resection of the transverse colon. Distal pancreatectomy, small bowel resection and successive splenectomy were performed due to a large hypertensive component. The postoperative period was uneventful. The histopathology of the surgical pieces was compatible with intra-abdominal desmoid fibromatosis. CONCLUSION: As far as we know from the literature, this is the largest mesenteric fibromatosis tumour ever to be excised. We also noticed that this is the first reported case of the concomitant presence of mesenteric fibromatosis and non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is not related to any of the described risk factors. Further research is needed to establish what type of association this presentation may indicate."
"The free fibula flap (FFF) is a preferred option for adult mandibular reconstruction. Due to skeletal immaturity, its routine use in pediatric patients remains in question. Inconsistencies regarding the ability of the FFF to grow in concordance with the patients' natural growth currently exist in the literature. The purpose of this report is to quantify mandibular growth in a young patient undergoing partial hemi-mandibular reconstruction with a FFF utilizing advanced three-dimensional software. METHODS: A 2-year old underwent left hemi-mandibular reconstruction with a FFF following resection of a desmoid tumor. The condyle was preserved. Using 3D software, changes in mandibular growth and morphology were evaluated based on preoperative (2.1 years old) and postoperative (2.5 years and 5.2 years old) computed tomography imaging. RESULTS: Mandibular growth occurred throughout the mandible in both postoperative evaluations. Greatest growth was seen in the ramus height. Fibula growth was also seen when comparing measurements to the virtual surgical planning guide. A novel parts comparison analysis revealed the greatest growth potential occurred at the condyle. CONCLUSION: Providing an objective evaluation using 3D software, we have demonstrated growth throughout the reconstructed mandible, with greatest growth occurring at the preserved condyle. Despite scientific limitations of our study, the potential for mandibular growth appears to remain after FFF reconstruction, offering successful functional and cosmetic outcomes."

"In recent years, three-dimensional reconstruction (3DR) models have become a standard tool in several medical fields such as education, surgical training simulation, patient-doctor communication, and surgical planning. Postoncologic reconstructive surgery in thoracic diseases might benefit from 3DR models; however, limited data on this application have been published worldwide. In this paper, the aim was to report our experience with 3DR modeling to determine resection and plan the surgical reconstruction in a patient with a desmoid tumor of the chest wall. For a better understanding of the case study, we describe all the steps from acquiring computed tomography (CT) scans to the final 3D rendering. A 68-year-old, non-smoking man presented at our outpatient department with painless swelling of the right anterobasal chest wall. A thorax-abdomen-brain CT scan revealed homogenous solid tissue with a dense mass measuring 80 mm x 62 mm. The final 3D model was evaluated by the surgical team (three medical doctors), who found the model to be powerful. Based on the results and the accuracy of the model, the multidisciplinary team decided that the tumor was resectable. Consequently, a surgical plan based on the 3D model was developed to perform chest wall reconstruction after radical resection. The patient underwent right anterolateral thoracotomy at the seventh intercostal space, which confirmed the CT scan findings and revealed infiltration of the serratus muscle and medial portion of the diaphragm. A radical tumor en bloc resection with chest wall and diaphragm resection was performed. The full-thickness chest wall and diaphragm defects were reconstructed using two separate biological patches of a porcine dermal collagen implant (Permacol Surgical Implant). Postoperative X-ray revealed unremarkable findings; the patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged 6 days after surgery. This case study illustrates that 3DR models enable a personalized approach to the treatment of desmoid tumors. Therefore, this approach should be developed further and studied systematically."
"CTNNB1 or adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC) mutations (these mutations being mutually exclusive). Desmoid-type fibromatosis of the breast (DFB) is rare with an incidence of 0.2% of breast tumors. The diagnosis of DFB is difficult, as it must be distinguished from metaplastic carcinoma and other spindle cell lesions. Sequencing of 128 DFB identified a lower rate of CTNNB1 mutations using Sanger (65.6%) or Sanger+next-generation sequencing (77.7%) and a higher rate of APC mutations (11.8%) than in all-site DF. By excluding patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (n=2), the rate of APC mutations in DFB was high (10.7%). The distribution of CTNNB1 mutations in DFB was different from all-site DF, with a higher rate of T41A (68.9%), a lower rate of S45F (5.7%), and a similar rate of S45T (12.6%). By combining the 2 molecular techniques in a 2-step manner (Sanger, then next-generation sequencing), we increased the detection rate of CTNNB1 mutations and lowered the rate of wild-type tumors from 34.4% to 9.8%, therefore improving the diagnosis of DFB. The identification of the exon 3 CTNNB1 mutation in breast spindle cell lesions is a highly specific tool for the diagnosis of DFB, in addition to extensive immunohistochemical analysis. Our study also underlines the importance of APC in DFB tumorigenesis. These findings have significant implications for patient care and management."
"This study aimed to establish a specified magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal and size criterion for assessing the response of desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF). METHODS: This retrospective study included 129 patients with DF who received non-surgical therapy. All patients underwent pretreatment and 6-month-interval follow-up MRI for >3 years (6 follow-up visits). The correlation between signal grade and size was determined. Signal grade and size among three response groups (partial response [PR], stable disease [SD], progression disease [PD]) were compared. The specified signal and size criterion was established, used to assess tumour response at each follow-up, and compared with the reference. The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST)1.1 criterion at the end of the 3rd year was considered the reference. RESULTS: MRI signals were moderately correlated with size changes (r = -0.56 and -0.41 for T2 grade and contrast-enhanced T1 grade, respectively). Changes in T2 grade and size in the three response groups were significantly different (all p < 0.01). The signal and size criterion accurately predicted 95% of PR patients at 2nd follow-up and 81.2% of PD patients at the 3rd follow-up, while only 13.1% of PR and 56.3% of PD patients were predicted by RECIST1.1. However, the accuracy of the signal & size criterion for predicting SD was lower than that of RECIST1.1. CONCLUSIONS: MRI signal is useful in assessing the response of DF. Signal & size criterion can identify patients with PR and PD earlier than RECIST1.1."
"Several morphologically overlapping (myo)fibroblastic neoplasms harbour USP6 fusions, including aneurysmal bone cysts, nodular fasciitis, myositis ossificans, cranial fasciitis, fibro-osseous pseudotumour of the digits, and cellular fibroma of the tendon sheath. USP6-induced neoplasms are almost universally benign and cured by local excision. We aim to highlight the diagnostic value of USP6 fusion detection in a series of aggressive-appearing paediatric myofibroblastic tumours. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three deep-seated, radiographically aggressive, and rapidly growing childhood myofibroblastic neoplasms were morphologically and molecularly characterised by USP6 break-apart fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH), transcriptome sequencing, and targeted capture analysis. Each tumour occurred in the lower-extremity deep soft tissue of a child presenting with pain, limping, or a mass. In all three patients, imaging studies showed a solid mass that infiltrated into surrounding skeletal muscle or involved/eroded underlying bone. The biopsied tumours consisted of variably cellular myofibroblastic proliferations with variable mitotic activity that lacked overt malignant cytological features. FISH showed that all tumours had USP6 rearrangements. On the basis of these results, all three patients were treated with conservative excision with positive margins. The excised tumours had foci resembling nodular fasciitis, fibromatosis, and pseudosarcomatous proliferation. Next-generation sequencing revealed COL1A1-USP6 fusions in two tumours and a COL3A1-USP6 fusion in the third tumour. One tumour had a subclonal somatic APC in-frame deletion. No recurrence was observed during follow-up (8-40 months). CONCLUSION: We present a series of benign, but aggressive-appearing, USP6-rearranged myofibroblastic tumours. These deep-seated tumours had concerning clinical and radiographic presentations and did not fit into one distinct histological category. These cases highlight the diagnostic value of USP6 fusion detection to identify benign nondescript tumours of this group, especially those with aggressive features, to avoid overtreatment."
We present the case of a patient with an inflammatory bowel disease to whom a pelvic desmoid tumor is discovered during an infertility study.
"Evolutionarily conserved Notch plays a critical role in embryonic development and cellular self-renewal. It has both tumour suppressor and oncogenic activity, the latter of which is widely described. Notch-activating mutations are associated with haematological malignancies and several solid tumours including breast, lung and adenoid cystic carcinoma. Moreover, upregulation of Notch receptors and ligands and aberrant Notch signalling is frequently observed in cancer. It is involved in cancer hallmarks including proliferation, survival, migration, angiogenesis, cancer stem cell renewal, metastasis and drug resistance. It is a key component of cell-to-cell interactions between cancer cells and cells of the tumour microenvironment, such as endothelial cells, immune cells and fibroblasts. Notch displays diverse crosstalk with many other oncogenic signalling pathways, and may drive acquired resistance to targeted therapies as well as resistance to standard chemo/radiation therapy. The past 10 years have seen the emergence of different classes of drugs therapeutically targeting Notch including receptor/ligand antibodies, gamma secretase inhibitors (GSI) and most recently, the development of Notch transcription complex inhibitors. It is an exciting time for Notch research with over 70 cancer clinical trials registered and the first-ever Phase III trial of a Notch GSI, nirogacestat, currently at the recruitment stage."
"To investigate differential imaging features of intra-abdominal desmoid tumors and peritoneal seeding in patients with history of cancer surgery. METHODS: Thirty-two patients who had a single pathologically proven intra-peritoneal lesion that developed after cancer surgery were enrolled between January 2000 and June 2019. There were 16 desmoid tumors and 16 peritoneal seeding lesions. Portal phase CT and/or (18)F-FDG PET findings were analyzed by two radiologists in consensus for the following items: location, size, shape, margin, contour, homogeneity, necrosis, adjacent organ invasion, calcification, intra-lesional fat, peritoneal infiltration, mass effect, and degree of enhancement. Hounsfield units (HU) and maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of the lesions were measured. Imaging findings were compared using the Chi square test, Fisher's exact test, and student t test. RESULTS: Desmoid tumors frequently showed well-defined margins (9/16) and smooth contours (12/16), whereas peritoneal seeding had ill-defined margins (13/16) and lobulated contours (11/16) (P = 0.028 and 0.013, respectively). Intra-lesional fat was found more frequently in desmoid tumors (7/16) than peritoneal seeding (1/16) (P = 0.014). Desmoid tumors showed iso-attenuation (13/16) compared to psoas muscle in portal phase, while peritoneal seeding depicted high attenuation (12/16) (P = 0.002). Mean HU was significantly lower in desmoid tumors (64.3) than peritoneal seeding lesions (95.1) (P = 0.001). However, the mean SUVmax of desmoid tumors (4.1) did not significantly differ from peritoneal seeding lesions (5.2) (P = 0.519). CONCLUSION: Several CT features including iso-attenuation in portal phase and presence of intra-lesional fat can be helpful in differentiating desmoid tumors from peritoneal seeding in patients with history of intra-abdominal cancer surgery."
"This study was undertaken to clarify the risk factors, including the mutation status of CTNNB1, for the local recurrence after surgery of the rare disease desmoid-type fibromatosis. It was designed as a multiinstitutional joint research project with 7 major centers in Japan participating. The committee members of 7 major medical centers specializing in bone and soft tissue tumors formed this study group to develop clinical care guidelines. Of 196 cases with specimens and medical records collected from the 7 institutions, 88 surgically treated ones were analyzed regarding clinicopathologic prognostic factors including CTNNB1 mutation status. Excluding R2 cases (n = 3), 5-year local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) was 52.9%. No case had received pre- or postoperative radiotherapy. Univariate analysis revealed that extremity location (P < .001) and larger size (8 cm or more, P = .036) were significant adverse risk factors for LRFS. Multivariate analysis indicated that extremity location (P < .001) was a significantly adverse factor in addition to recurrent tumor (P = .041), S45F mutation (P = .028), and R1 surgical margin (P = .039). Preoperative drug treatment, including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, did not reduce the incidence of local recurrence (P = .199). This is the first study to analyze the factors correlating with outcomes of surgical treatment, including CTNNB1 mutation status, in a relatively large number of cases from an Asian country. Tumor location was found to be the most influential prognostic factor for local recurrence, similar to the results from Europe and North America. The development of more sensitive method(s) for determination of CTNNB1 mutation is a priority for future study."
"Desmoid tumors are clinical entities rarely diagnosed at an initial presentation because of its low incidence, they are characterized by a locally aggressive presentation and high rates of local relapse. Its presentation can be intra- or extra-abdominal. We present a clinical case of a female, 15 year old patient, with three months of abdominal pain, a giant intra-abdominal mass was diagnosed with histologic diagnosis of desmoid tumor. Several surgical procedures were performed, having a las a R1 resection (focally microscopic margins). In this case association with pregnancy, abdominal trauma, previous surgeries and genetic syndromes were discarded."
"To evaluate the long-term effectiveness of patients received surgical treatment under the guidance of ""West China Classification"" of desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) in the shoulder girdle. Methods: The clinical data of 32 patients with DTF in the shoulder girdle admitted between June 2003 and December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed, including 14 males and 18 females, aged 14-56 years with an average age of 36.8 years. The maximum diameter of the tumor was 7-19 cm, with an average of 11.1 cm. According to the ""West China Classification"" of DTF in the shoulder girdle, there were 4 cases of region , 3 cases of region , 6 cases of region , 3 cases of region , 5 cases of regions +, 5 cases of regions +, and 6 cases of regions ++. In addition, the involvement of blood vessels and nerves was also taken into consideration for choosing a surgical approach. Finally, 12 cases were operated via anteroposterior approach (group A), 14 via posterior approach (group B), and 6 via combined anterior-posterior approach (group C). The 1993 Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS93) score (including pain, limb function, satisfaction, hand position, hand flexibility, and lifting ability), Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score, range of motion (ROM) of shoulder joint (including flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction), and complications of patients in the 3 groups were recorded and compared. Results: All the 32 patients were followed up 30-190 months, with an average of 94.6 months. At last follow-up, complications occurred in 5 cases (15.6%), including 2 cases (16.6%) in group A, 2 (14.3%) in group B, and 1 (16.6%) in group C. There was no significant difference in the incidence of complications among the 3 groups ( P=1.000). Tumor recurrence occurred in 5 (15.6%) cases, including 1 (8.3%) case in group A, 2 (14.3%) in group B, and 1 (16.6%) in group C. No significant difference was found in the recurrence rate among the 3 groups ( P=1.000). At last follow-up, MSTS93 score of pain, limb function, satisfaction, hand flexibility, and hand position in groups A and B were significantly better than those in group C ( P<0.05), even though no significant difference existed between group A and group B ( P>0.05). The lifting ability score in group C was significantly lower than in group A ( P<0.05), and no significant difference was found between other groups ( P>0.05). The JOA score and flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction activities of shoulder in groups A and B were significantly better than those in group C ( P<0.05). The extension activity in group A was significantly better than that in group B ( P<0.05), the flexion activity in group B was significantly better than that in group A ( P<0.05). There was no significant difference in other indexes between groups A and B ( P>0.05). Conclusion: Taking a rational approach to fully expose and completely remove the tumor is the key point of surgical treatment for patients with DTF in the shoulder girdle. At the same time, preservation of vital structures and reconstruction of soft tissues should also be taken into consideration. Overall, surgical treatment under the guidance of ""West China Classification"" of DTF in the shoulder girdle has achieved satisfactory long-term effectiveness."
"The mainstay of the treatment for desmoid-type fibromatoses has been shifting from surgery to drug treatment, making accurate prediction of the efficacy of drug treatment of extreme importance. On the other hand, desmoid-type fibromatoses arise everywhere in the body. The purpose of this systematic review was to address the clinical question of whether tumour location has an impact on the efficacy of drug treatment. METHODS: A literature search from January 1990 to August 2017 was conducted. Four reviewers independently assessed and screened the literature for eligibility and determined the final articles. They rated each report according to the Grading of Recommendations Development and Evaluation approach. Based on the quality of 'Body of Evidence', our clinical guideline committee developed a recommendation for the clinical question. RESULTS: In total, 128 articles were extracted. After the screenings, 5 were chosen for the final evaluation. The drugs used in these articles were one each of toremifene, sorafenib, and methotrexate and vinblastine and of meloxicam. There were no randomized controlled trials, and two prospective and three retrospective case series were included. Therapeutic effects were observed slightly more markedly in extremity using meloxicam or methotrexate and vinblastine. In contrast, the efficacy of toremifene was slightly higher in non-extremity. However, the evidence level of all of the reports was judged to be low. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the low evidence level, we concluded that the site-specific therapeutic effects of drugs could not be confirmed in desmoid-type fibromatoses."
"An accurate diagnosis is crucial to determine the treatment modality for desmoid-type fibromatosis, although the histopathological diagnosis is occasionally difficult to make. Many desmoid-type fibromatosis have been reported to have hotspot mutation of beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1). In the present study, we performed a systematic review to verify the usefulness of CTNNB1 mutation analysis in the diagnosis of desmoid-type fibromatosis. METHODS: A literature search from January 1990 to August 2017 was conducted. Three reviewers independently assessed and screened the literature for eligibility and determined the final articles to be evaluated. Data regarding the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and usefulness of CTNNB1 mutation analysis in the diagnosis of desmoid-type fibromatosis were recorded. We rated each report according to the Grading of Recommendations Development and Evaluation approach. RESULTS: The search yielded 90 studies, seven of which were included after the first and second screenings. The positive rate of CTNNB1 mutation in desmoid-type fibromatosis was 86.8%, but the cohort of six of the seven reports was already diagnosed histopathologically as desmoid-type fibromatosis. Therefore, the usefulness of CTNNB1 mutation analysis in a cohort that is difficult to diagnose histopathologically is not clear in this review. Nevertheless, CTNNB1 mutation showed very high specificity in desmoid-type fibromatosis, indicating the usefulness of CTNNB1 mutation analysis in its diagnosis in combination with histological examination. CONCLUSION: Because the lack of data precludes any useful comparison with histological diagnosis, the evidence level is low. However, considering its specificity, CTNNB1 mutation analysis may be useful in cases in which the histopathological diagnosis is difficult."
"To report the risk of a serious etiology in a cohort of children with Horner syndrome without a known cause at presentation. METHODS: The medical records of children (<18 years of age) with Horner syndrome of unknown etiology at presentation who underwent a workup at a single tertiary-care pediatric hospital over a 20-year period were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 48 patients with Horner syndrome were included. Median age at diagnosis was 12 months (range, 1 month to 17 years). A serious etiology was discovered in 7 (15%): neuroblastoma in 5, nasopharyngeal carcinoma in 1, and desmoid tumor in 1. Other causes were congenital/idiopathic (27 [56%]), acquired/idiopathic (10 [21%]), and likely birth trauma (4 [8%]). In 3 patients with a serious etiology, there were significant clinical manifestations of the pathology in addition to Horner syndrome. In the other 4 cases with a serious etiology (all neuroblastoma), the patients presented with Horner syndrome in isolation, and the tumor was discovered during a routine workup. All 5 neuroblastoma cases presented before 5 years of age; urine catecholamines were elevated in 4 of the 5. Imaging revealed mass lesions in the neck or upper chest in all 7 cases with a serious etiology. CONCLUSIONS: In children presenting with Horner syndrome of unknown cause, there is a small but nontrivial risk of a serious underlying etiology. When a young child presents with Horner syndrome in isolation, urine catecholamine testing and imaging of the oculosympathetic pathway are recommended to rule out neuroblastoma."
"Spinal solitary fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytoma (SFT/HPC) is a rare mesenchymal malignancy. Radiographically, SFT/HPCs have a mutable appearance, with irregular borders, heterogeneous contrast enhancement, and variable but frequently hypointense T2 signal. We report a series of 5 neurosurgically managed spinal SFT/HPCs treated at our institution, with particular attention to 3 lesions demonstrating marked T2-hypointensity and differential diagnosis for the unusual finding of a ""T2 dark"" spinal lesion. Retrospective chart review of prospectively maintained surgical database, queried by diagnosis and site codes, 2002-2017. Retrospective radiographic review, with initial screening via keyword search of MR reports for ""T2"" and ""hypointense."" Four primary and one metastatic spinal SFT/HPCs were operatively treated during the study period (median follow-up 12 months; range 10-92). Three demonstrated marked T2 hypointensity on preoperative MRI, underwent primary resection-GTR in two, STR in one-and have remained progression-free on routine postoperative surveillance. Two patients with isointense lesions recurred within the follow-up period. Radiographic review identified a host of predominantly rare T2-hypointense lesions, including arteriovenous malformation, disk fragmentations, calcific arachnoiditis, calcifying pseudoneoplasm of the neuraxis, cavernoma, cord hemorrhage/acute blood, desmoid, granulocytic sarcoma, pigmented villonodular synovitis, Edheim-Chester, extramedullary hematopoiesis, IgG4-negative inflammatory pseudotumor, idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis, B-cell lymphoma, primary melanoma neoplasm, melanotic schwannoma, meningioma, opacification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, osteoblastoma, osteochondroma, osteosarcoma, and synovial cyst. T2 hypointensity is associated with SFT/HPC, and may be an indicator relative indolence. ""Dark"" T2 spinal lesions are rare, with a narrow differential populated predominantly by rare entities."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is a rare, locally infiltrative, and fibroblastic proliferative disease. DF usually arises from abdominal fascial tissue, but in rare cases, it can occur in extra-abdominal areas. A 73-year-old Japanese male complained of a painless, left anterior neck mass of 3-month duration. Computed tomography revealed the mass measured 9 x 7 x 6 cm and extended to the anterior mediastinum, with invasion of the left clavicle. En bloc resection of the tumor with the left sternoclavicular joint and the medial portion of the left clavicle was performed by cervico-thoracic approach with L-shaped partial sternotomy. Histopathologic examination showed fascicular growth of spindle-shaped cells separated by abundant collagen. Immunohistologic examination revealed nuclear staining of beta-catenin and cytoplasmic staining of vimentin. Genetic analysis of 160 cancer-related genes by next-generation sequencing (NGS) demonstrated only a missense mutation in the CTNNB1 gene (c.133T>C, p.S45P). DF extending from the neck to the anterior mediastinum is rare. We report the complete resection of a large-sized DF with the clavicular invasion. A low-frequency CTNNB1 mutation of DF was identified. Genetic analysis with NGS was beneficial for the diagnosis."
"Familial adenomatous polyposis is described as one of the common two types of genetic disorders: APC and MUTYH gene associated polyposis syndrome and the clinical differences between the two can sometimes be unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis and comparison was made of clinical, surgical, and histological criteria, mutation types and the long-term results of patients who underwent genetic analysis which resulted in the diagnosis of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis between 1984 and 2018. RESULTS: Of the total 71 patients included in the study, 14 were identified with the MUTYH gene, and 57 with the APC mutation. In patients with the APC mutation, 63% had duodenal adenoma, 61% gastric polyp and 54% had desmoid tumor. Of the patients with the MUTYH mutation, 21% had duodenal adenoma and 21% were diagnosed with gastric polyps. In 21% of the patients with APC mutation, the polyp count was <100, and 64% of those with the MUTYH mutation had >100 polyps in the colon No statistical difference was determined between the groups in respect of the proportion of patients with >100 polyps. CONCLUSION: The pre-operative genetic testing of patients with polyposis coli will be useful in determining the future clinical outcome and helpful in guiding an informed decision as to whether to apply surgical treatment. It is useful to determine the colonic and extra-colonic involvement of genetic mutation diseases in patients with Familial adenomatous polyposis."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a rare, potentially locally aggressive disease. Herein we present our experience in the treatment with radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In total 40 patients who received 44 treatments from 2009 to 2018 at the Heidelberg University Hospital with photons (N = 28) as well as protons (N = 15) and carbon ions (N = 1) were investigated. The median age at radiotherapy was 41 years [range 8-78]. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) was confirmed for nine patients and 30 had a unifocal desmoid tumor. The localizations were abdominal wall, abdominopelvic cavity, thoracic wall, extremity, head and neck and trunk. The median prescribed dose was 54 Gy/ Gy (RBE) [range 39.6-66, IQR 50-60]. Eleven treatments were performed at the time of first diagnosis; 33 at the time of progression or recurrence. Post-operative radiotherapy was performed in 17 cases. The median planning target volume was 967 ml [84-4364 ml, IQR 447-1988]. Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier Method. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 32 months [1-153]. At the end of the follow-up interval all patients but one were alive. The estimated local progression free survival of the treated lesion in 3 and 5 years was 76.4% and 63,8%, respectively. The progression-free survival in 3 and 5 years was 72.3 and 58.4% and the overall survival was 97.4 and 97.4%, respectively. In case of macroscopic tumor (N = 31) before radiotherapy a partial remission was observed in 12 cases (38.7%) and a complete remission in 4 cases (12.9%). Progression was observed in 13 (29.5%) cases, predominantly at the margin of the planning target volume (PTV, N = 5, 38,4%) followed by progression within the PTV (N = 4, 30.8%). In univariate analysis multifocal localization was associated with impaired progression-free survival (p = 0.013). One patient developed a grade V gastrointestinal bleeding, otherwise no acute toxicity > degrees III was observed. Late toxicity was depending on the localization of the desmoid tumor and was especially severe in patients with FAP and abdominopelvine desmoids including gastrointesinal fistula, perforation and abscess. CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy in the treatment of desmoids can lead to long term control. Treatment of patients with abdominopelvine desmoids should be avoided, as the risk of higher-grade complications is substantial."
"Plantar fibromatosis is a benign fibroblastic, connective tissue proliferative disorder of the superficial plantar aponeurosis of the foot. It belongs to a family of similar diseases (Peyronies and Dupytrens) that were first described in 1610 by Plater.[1] George Ledderhose, a German physician, initially described the disease in 1897 following his observation of fifty cases.[2] Ledderhose disease is diagnosed by identifying nodules within the central or medial bands of the plantar fascia of the foot. Onset is slow and patients usually present after the disease becomes locally aggressive causing pain and swelling in the medial non-weight bearing plantar surface of the feet.[3]"

"It is challenging to know at the first which patients with desmoid fibromatosis (DF) are better suited to conservative or aggressive treatment. To investigate whether the low signal intensity bundles on T1- or T2-weighted images (WI), termed the ""black fiber sign (BFS),"" can predict non-progressive behavior in the conservative approach. METHODS: This retrospective study included 59 patients with primary DF managed with wait-and-see approach from 2005 to 2018 and serial MR images were analyzed. Three observers blinded to the patient information verified the presence or absence of BFS on baseline T1 or T2WI. The likelihood of progression-free survival (PFS) after ascertaining the presence or absence of the BFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed with the log-rank test. RESULTS: PFS was significantly higher in cases with BFS than without BFS on T1WI (p < 0.01), but there was no significant difference in PFS between cases with and without BFS on T2WI. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that the absence of BFS on T1WI was a high-risk factor for progression (hazard ratio, 14.9; p < 0.01). Drastic tumor regression was apparent with significantly increased low-signal area in cases with BFS on T1WI. Intra- and interobserver reliabilities of BFS on T1WI were in almost-perfect agreement (kappa > 0.8). CONCLUSION: Our retrospective observational data support that presence of BFS in baseline MRI may be a predictor for progression-free survival of DF. BFS on T1WI is easily identifiable and can be utilized clinically in patients with DF. KEY POINTS: * We proposed a new imaging marker for prediction of desmoid fibromatosis progression. * The absence of black fiber sign predicted a high risk of disease progression."
"Soft tissue tumors of the abdomen and retroperitoneum encompass a wide range of benign and malignant neoplasms. Retroperitoneal sarcomas, the most common, are composed of rare malignancies with numerous histiotypes. Surgery remains the cornerstone of treatment and the only curative option for retroperitoneal sarcomas. With histiotype-dependent local and distant recurrences, it is imperative these cases are discussed in a multidisciplinary tumor board setting at specialized sarcoma centers. This review discusses the current evidence for the management of abdominal and retroperitoneal soft tissue tumors, with particular focus on retroperitoneal sarcomas and desmoid tumors."
"To evaluate the imaging characteristics of aggressive angiomyxoma (AA) and identify features which would help to differentiate it from similar appearing lesions. METHODS: A retrospective review of departmental records was done and cases where AA was suspected on CT or MRI were included. With histopathology as gold-standard, the cases were grouped into AA or mimics and differentiating features were identified on USG, CT and MRI. Fischer's exact test was applied for the statistical significance of the differentiating features. RESULTS: 18 patients were identified of which 2 were excluded for lack of histopathology records. 10 were AA and 6 mimics which included 2 fibromatoses, 2 neurogenic tumors, and 1 each of germ cell tumor and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. On MRI, all AA showed T2 hyperintensity and intense contrast enhancement with characteristic laminated pattern in 7/9 cases. Diffusion restriction was seen in 2/3 cases, cystic component in 4/10 and hemorrhage in 1/10 cases. Pelvic fibromatosis was the closest imaging differential showing laminated pattern in one of the cases. CONCLUSION: Large pelvic mass with abdominal/perineal extension in reproductive age female patient should lead to suspicion of AA. Laminated pattern on T2 weighted images and intense homogeneous contrast enhancement further add to the diagnostic confidence. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This study for the first time describes radiological mimics of AA. Large cystic component, diffusion restriction, hemorrhage and organ infiltration have not been previously described in AA."
"We report the case of a 55-year-old man with a surgical history of distal gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction performed 3 years prior to the present episode. During the follow-up, a newly developed, rapidly growing intraabdominal mass was detected in the mesentery of the small intestine. Although the patient had been asymptomatic, surgical resection was planned with the suspicion of malignancy, especially lymph node recurrence of the gastric cancer, owing to its rapid growth. Laparotomy showed that the tumor was located in the mesentery of the small intestine near the Roux-en-Y limb, and due to the involvement of the feeding vessels to the Roux-en-Y limb, the anastomotic site was resected en bloc with the tumor, and the whole Roux-en-Y limb was reconstructed. The histopathological finding was compatible with desmoid-type fibromatosis of the mesentery of the small intestine. Here we report our case and discuss the previously reported literature, especially related to gastric cancer."

"The treatment for desmoid-type fibromatosis involves surgical resection and medication therapy, but the standard treatment has not yet been established. In the West, the usefulness of radiation therapy has been reported. We encountered a patient with desmoid-type fibromatosis in the pelvis who was treated by radiation and medication therapies and achieved a good tumor reduction effect. The patient was a 70-year-old man. He had a 6-year history of pain in the right leg and had a palpable mass on the right side of the anus; he was admitted to our department. CT showed a 12x7x12 cm mass in the pelvis, and CT-guided needle biopsy revealed a desmoid-type fibromatosis. Because tumor exclusion resulted in obstruction of the rectum, radiation therapy(60 Gy in 30 Fr)was started after performing transverse colon colostomy; simultaneous medication therapy with a COX-2 inhibitor and the anti-allergic agent tranilast was administered. Cystic degeneration was observed 5 months after the end of radiation therapy, and after 12 months, the tumor volume had halved. Around 28 months after the end of radiation therapy, medication treatment has been continued with slow contraction."
"A 40-year-old man with no previous history of abdominal surgery or noteworthy family history presented to our hospital because of a palpable abdominal mass. Abdominal CT revealed a 9 cm diameter mass in the mesocolon. The differential diagnosis included desmoid tumor, and right hemicolectomy with partial resection of the pancreas head and duodenum was performed. Pathologically, the tumor cells were negative for S-100, c-kit, CD34, and desmin but partially positive for a-SMA and slightly for b-catenin. From these findings, desmoid tumor of the mesocolon was diagnosed. Invasion of the pancreas was also found. Desmoid tumor is pathologically benign, but because of its malignant-like characteristics, such as direct invasion and local recurrence, it is treated as a malignant tumor. Desmoid tumors are associated with familial adenomatous polyposis coli and Gardner syndrome, or they arise in patients who have a history of laparotomy or antecedent trauma. In this paper, we report a rare case of resected sporadic desmoid tumor in the mesocolon with pancreatic invasion, together with a review of the literature."
"The objective of this study was to evaluate treatment outcomes for patients with desmoid tumors (DTs) receiving local therapy with surgery alone, radiation therapy (RT) alone, or combined modality therapy (RT and surgery). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional cohort study of 412 patients with nonmesenteric DTs who received local therapy at the authors' institution between 1965 and 2018. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 95 months (range, 1-509 months). Local recurrence occurred in 127 patients (31%) at a median time of 21 months (interquartile range, 12-38 months). The 5-year local control (LC) rate was 67%. Patient or tumor factors that were significantly associated with poorer 5-year LC in a multivariable analysis included an age </= 30 years (57% vs 75% for an age > 30 years; hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; P = .004), an extremity location (57% vs 71% for a nonextremity location; HR, 1.77; P = .004), and large tumors (59% for >10 cm [HR, 2.17; P = .004] and 65% for 5.1-10 cm [HR, 1.71; P = .02] vs 76% for </=5 cm). Subset analyses of these high-risk patients revealed no local therapy strategy to be superior for young patients </= 30 years old (HR for surgery, 1.42; P = .33; HR for RT, 1.36; P = .38) or for large tumors > 10 cm (HR for surgery, 1.55; P = .46; HR for RT, 0.91; P = .91). However, for patients with extremity tumors, surgery alone was significantly associated with inferior LC (HR for surgery, 5.15; P < .001; HR for RT, 1.51; P = .38). CONCLUSIONS: Local therapy provides durable tumor control in the majority of patients with DTs. However, young patients, patients with an extremity location, and patients with large tumors are at increased risk of recurrence. When active treatment is indicated, systemic therapy should perhaps be considered as a first-line option in these high-risk subsets. Prospective multi-institutional studies evaluating this strategy are warranted."
"The treatment of desmoid tumours (DTs) has greatly evolved in recent years, and surgery is no longer considered a first-line treatment. Percutaneous biopsy with molecular analysis for beta-catenin or APC gene mutation provides a certain diagnosis. After imaging, a specialized multidisciplinary tumour board (MDT) addresses the following therapeutic strategy. As more than half of patients stabilize or regress, despite initial progression, active surveillance is offered to most patients as the first option. Surgery is proposed for complications such as perforation and occlusion, which sometimes are the first manifestations of the disease. In these cases, limiting surgery to the treatment of complications and leaving the tumour in place is possible if significant bowel sacrifice is needed, especially in patients with previous colectomy for polyposis. Medical therapy is discussed by the MDT in cases of functional or life-threatening masses and is preferred to local treatments that could be mutilating and often incomplete. First-line surgery is now contraindicated in cases of incomplete unplanned surgery, recurrence, pregnancy or DTs occurring in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). The best indications of second-line surgery are significantly progressing disease when morbidity is acceptable, such as parietal locations. Medical and other locoregional treatments (radiotherapy, isolated limb perfusion and cryotherapy) should be considered by the MTB when surgery might cause sequelae."
"Fibromatoses or desmoid tumors are relatively rare tumors derived from the musculoaponeurotic system. This tumor has no specific clinical symptoms and it is sometimes misdiagnosed as other diseases such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). PATIENT CONCERNS: A 28-year-old man visited Peking Union Medical College for a tangible abdominal mass without abdominal pain or distention. DIAGNOSES: Considering the imaging characteristics and clinical manifestation, this mass was primarily diagnosed as GIST before surgery. During the surgery, the occupancy was found under the ileocecal mesentery, with grayish white appearance, tough texture, and poor mobility, which was not consistent with the character of the GIST. After the surgery, pathological examination and individual immunohistochemistry results demonstrated that the lesion was compatible with the diagnosis of retroperitoneal fibromatosis with purulent inflammation of chronic lymphadenitis. INTERVENTIONS: Therefore, we decided to perform tumor mass resection, right colon resection, partial duodenum resection, and intestinal anastomosis on laparotomy, but the right ureter was retained. After excision of the tumor, the ends of the intestine segment were continuously sutured. OUTCOMES: The patient experienced no intraoperative or postoperative complications, and was discharged 3 days after surgery. Periodic follow-up physical examinations such as the abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography were performed each 3 months, and no evidence of recurrence was observed during the whole 12 months. LESSONS: To sum up, intra-abdominal fibromatosis is an extremely rare tumor that must be differentiated from other tumors of the digestive tract, and pathological and immunohistochemical examination is a critical part of the diagnosis. Early diagnosis of fibromatosis is essential for the outcome. Extensive resection of the mass minimizes the risk of relapse."
"We present a case in which serotonin syndrome developed immediately after the initiation of low-dose methadone following an increase in oxycodone dose and the initiation of duloxetine. The symptoms of serotonin syndrome were alleviated and later disappeared upon cessation of methadone alone. The case was a 47-year-old woman with a desmoid tumor. The administration of duloxetine (20 mg/day) was initiated while the patient took oxycodone sustained-release tablets (40 mg/day). The following day, excessive perspiration, chills, and tremors appeared after the initiation of 15 mg/day methadone. Discontinuation of methadone led to an alleviation of the symptoms which completely disappeared 3 days later. The results suggest that low-dose methadone can trigger serotonin syndrome as early as after the first dose. Thus, it is important to be aware of the risks and to immediately take action if symptoms appear."
"Desmoid tumors are a manifestation of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), associated with mutation of the APC gene. Although considered benign tumors, desmoids can be aggressive and cause considerable morbidity. Known risk factors for desmoid tumor growth include location of mutations within the APC gene, family history of desmoid tumors, previous surgery, female gender, and pregnancy. Desmoids occur at diverse sites, commonly within the abdomen or at sites of previous surgery; thoracic desmoids are relatively uncommon. Reported here is a highly desmoid tumor-prone FAP family with a truncating mutation in the APC gene at codon 1550 (c.4648G>T) in which female siblings developed remarkably similar thoracic desmoids with highly aggressive tumor behavior during the onset of puberty, throughout adolescence, and in one sibling during and following pregnancy. Both siblings had a fatal outcome. This case underscores the potential for aggressive behavior of desmoids during adolescence and the need for close vigilance during the adolescent and young adult (AYA) age range in desmoid-prone FAP kindreds."
"A 42-year-old female patient with a history of cervicothoracic junction meningioma World Health Organization grade I, resected in early 2011, was admitted to the hospital with intractable headache and lower extremity weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an epidural mass compressing the spinal cord at the prior surgical site, which was interpreted as recurrent meningioma. Following surgical resection, histopathological analysis revealed desmoid fibromatosis (desmoid tumor). In retrospect, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging performed prior to surgery should have allowed for prospective exclusion of meningioma as the recurrent mass and suggested an alternative diagnosis such as post-traumatic desmoid fibromatosis or the need for biopsy to confirm diagnosis."
"To demonstrate techniques of laparoscopic ureteral reconstruction for long-segment ureteral defects in gynecologic surgeries. DESIGN: Step-by-step demonstration of a laparoscopic ureteral reimplantation using the Boari flap and ileal interposition. SETTING: Gynecologic diseases often involve the ureter; hence, knowledge of ureteral reconstruction techniques is imperative in gynecologic surgeries. The important aspect of ureteral reconstruction is to ensure tension-free anastomosis; therefore, various methods are required depending on the length of the ureteral defect [1]. The Boari flap and ileal interposition are preferred for repairing 8-cm to 12-cm and >12-cm ureteral defects, respectively. These methods have traditionally required large incisions [2,3]. Laparoscopic ureteral reimplantation using the Boari flap and ileal interposition has been reported to be as safe as the open technique and superior in terms of postoperative recovery in urologic surgeries [3,4]; however, to the best of our knowledge, it has not been reported in the field of gynecology. To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate the techniques of laparoscopic Boari flap and ileal ureter replacement in gynecologic surgeries. The technique was approved by our institutional review board. INTERVENTIONS: The first case involved an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor, whereas the second case involved recurrent endometrial cancer. In both cases, long-segment ureteral resection was required to achieve complete tumor clearance. Laparoscopic ureteral reimplantation was performed successfully, without any complications, using the Boari flap in the first case and ileal interposition in the second. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic ureteral reimplantation is technically feasible for the management of long-segment ureteral defects."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF), also known as desmoid tumor, is an extremely rare, benign, mesenchymal fibrous tumor with no potential for metastasis. It can arise from any part of the body, most commonly extra-abdominally. Intra-abdominal DF can present sporadically, in sites of previous trauma, surgical scars and irradiation, or in association with familial adenomatous polyposis and Gardner syndrome. Intra-abdominal DF is uncommon and especially rare after a common surgery like cholecystectomy. We report a rare case of a 67-year-old male who presented with a locally aggressive intra-abdominal DF in the gallbladder fossa, status post cholecystectomy. This progressively enlarging infiltrative enhancing solid mass in the gallbladder fossa on serial computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated gastric outlet obstruction, biliary obstruction, portal vein narrowing and encasement of hepatic artery. Diagnosis of DF in this postoperative setting was delayed and challenging due to uncharacteristic clinical presentation. Radiologists should be aware of this unusual diagnosis and spectrum of imaging findings to help in timely surgical management and planning."
"A 36-year-old man was admitted to hospital for a right thyroid nodule incidentally discovered on a chest computed tomography scan for a rib fracture. He had no history of radiation to the head and neck, no known family history of endocrine disease, and no medical or surgical history. A 17 x 10 mm, well-demarcated, multinodular, whitish nodule with neither necrosis nor hemorrhage was found in the right thyroid. Microscopically, the tumor consisted of epithelial cell nests with oval, plasmacytoid or polygonal cells with speckled chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli and granular cytoplasm. The surrounding stroma showed amyloid deposition and prominent spindle cell proliferation with myxoid substance. Epithelial cell nests showed an immunoreactive pattern for typical medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), and the spindle cell stroma showed nuclear expression of beta-catenin. This may be the first report on histopathologic findings of MTC with desmoid-type fibromatosis. Further studies are necessary to discover the clinicopathologic characteristics and pathogenesis of this rare type of tumor."
"A rare clinical observation of desmoid fibroma associated with a breast implant is presented. When making a morphological (cytological, histological) diagnosis at the light-optical level before surgery, a differential morphological diagnosis was performed between cicatricial changes, the stromal component of the phyloid tumor and desmoid fibroma. Only immunohistochemistry allowed us to establish a diagnosis of desmoid fibroma, since tumor cells expressed diffusely SMA, focally desmin, and most importantly, ss-catenin expression was observed in some cells."
"*Intra-abdominal desmoid tumor is rare with no particular imaging features, so preoperative diagnosis is quite difficult.*R0 resection is essential for treatment but often requires extensive surgical trauma, which can be a risk for recurrence.*A laparoscopic approach for this tumor was effective, with the resulting diagnosis and resection being less traumatic.*The first report of successful laparoscopic complete resection and reconstructive procedures were demonstrated."
"The development of desmoid fibromatosis after tumor resection may mimic local recurrence. To our knowledge, this phenomenon has not been reported after extremity sarcoma resection. We report four cases of desmoid-type fibromatosis (""desmoid tumors"") mimicking local recurrence after extremity sarcoma resection. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients treated for extremity sarcoma by our orthopedic oncology service from 2014 to 2019 and identified four patients with biopsy-proven desmoid tumors. We extracted clinical, pathologic, radiographic, and operative data for the primary neoplasms and desmoid tumors. RESULTS: Four patients with postresection surveillance magnetic resonance imaging suspicious for local recurrence underwent further analysis showing desmoid tumors. Patients underwent image-guided needle biopsy, with specimens demonstrating fibromatosis-type histologic characteristics. Two cases were beta-catenin positive. Desmoid tumors were managed with observation. No patient had experienced local or distant recurrence of the primary tumor at a mean follow-up of 30 months after resection (range, 23-34 months); none underwent surgery for symptoms of desmoid tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Desmoid tumors should be considered part of the differential diagnosis when assessing patients with radiographic concern for postresection local recurrence of extremity bone and soft-tissue sarcoma. An image-guided needle biopsy can inform diagnosis and management."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is an uncommon disease which mimics sarcoma but is more locally aggressive but with less metastatic potential than sarcoma. Diagnosis is difficult and treatment protocols have changed to include more non-surgical options as compared with sarcoma. This is a retrospective study of the clinical presentation, imaging findings, treatment given, and outcomes of pathologically proven desmoid-type fibromatosis patients who presented to government medical college Kozhikode."

"With recent conservative strategies, prognosis of patients with desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) is about function preservation. We analyzed the long-term quality of life (QoL) of pediatric patients with DTF. METHODS: All French young patients (<21years) treated between 2005 and 2016 for a DTF in the EpSSG NRSTS-05 study were analyzed. A first wait-and-see strategy was recommended. Patients' QoL was analyzed with the internationally validated Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ). We focused on the relevant subscales scores: physical functioning (PF), role social limitations physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health perception (GH) and physical (PhS) and psychosocial (PsS) summary measures. RESULTS: Among the 81 patients, 52 families answered the CHQ (median delay since diagnosis = 6.2years; min2.2-max13.3 years). Median age at diagnosis was 11.5 years. Primary site: limbs (52%), head/neck (27%), or trunk (21%). Five year-Progression Free Survival was 39.1% (95%CI: 27.7-50.5%). As initial management for these 52 patients, 30 patients were first observed (57%), 13 had surgery (25%) and 9 received chemotherapy (18%). Total burden of therapy was exclusive surgery (9pts/18%), exclusive chemotherapy (18pts/35%), surgery + chemotherapy (13pts/25%), chemotherapy + radiotherapy (1 pt), surgery + chemotherapy + radiotherapy (1 pt), wait and see (10 pt). Regarding the parent forms, patients have significant lower PF (86.0vs.96.1; p = 0.03), RP (82.0vs.93.6; p = 0.04), GH (60vs.73; p < 0.005) and PhS (46.2 vs.53; p = 0.02) scores compared to healthy population. Comparison of QoL subscales scores according to initial strategy (wait-and-see vs.surgery/chemotherapy) did not reveal any difference (PF = 87.3vs.84.9; p = 0.80/RP = 83.4vs.78.7; p = 0.72/BP = 78.9vs.78.2; p = 0.95/GH = 59.7vs60; p = 0.97). Similar results were found using the children or adult forms. CONCLUSIONS: Initial wait-and-see strategy does not affect long term functional impairment."
"Primary mesenteric fibromatosis is a rare, locally invasive, non-metastasizing type of intra-abdominal fibromatoses with a very high rate of recurrence. In this study, we aimed to present our surgical approach, tumor characteristics, clinical presentation and long-term follow-up results in cases of primary mesenteric fibromatosis. MATERIAL AND METODS: The data collected from 11 patients who underwent surgery due to primary mesenteric fibromatosis in our clinic between 2010 and 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Abdominal ipain, abdominal distention, and two patients (18.2%) were operated on with a diagnosis of acute abdomen in the emergency setting due to mechanical bowel obstruction in one patient There were 11 patients in our study. Six patients were female and 5 were male. The mean age was 44.2+/-15.8 years. Abdominal mass was detected in 5 patients (45.5%) who had complaints of mechanical bowel obstruction such as nausea and vomitingand gastrointestinal perforation in other patient. Mesenteric mass was detected in 3 patients (27.3%) with vague abdominal pain. One patient (9.1%) presented with abdominal pain and swelling of the right leg. After a mean follow-up period of 43.4+/-28.4 months, only 1 patient (9.1%) had recurrence and required reoperation approximately 80 months after the first operation. One patient (9.1%) died of anastomotic leakage and sepsis in the first 30 days postoperatively, and other patient (9.1%) idied of other reasons 1 year later postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Although mesenteric fibromatosis is a benign tumor pathologically, the main principle in the treatment of this tumor which is clinically aggressive and has high recurrence rate is wide surgical resection. Mesenteric fibromatoses have a varied clinical presentation. Radiological imaging methods helps diagnosis and planning the surgical treatment. Immunohistochemical characteristics confirms the diagnosis and differentiates from other similar tumors. KEY WORDS: Desmoid tumor, Fibromatosis, Mesentery, Mesenteric tumor,Mesenteric fibromatosis."
"An intra-abdominaldesmoid tumor, especially omentaldesmoid tumor, is rare. Here, we report a case of omentaldesmoid tumor after a smallbowelresection for gastrointestinalstromaltumor (GIST). A 73-year-old man underwent a partial resection of smallbowelfor GIST. He received adjuvant therapy with imatinib due to high risk of recurrence. After 2.5 years of treatment, a follow-up CT showed a 15mm nodule in the omentum near the splenic flexure. We considered the possibility of recurrence and imatinib failure, and laparoscopic tumor resection was performed for differential diagnosis. Immunohistochemicalstaining showed negative for c-kit, CD34, desmin, and S100. However, it was diagnosed as desmoid tumor because of positive b-catenin. Intra-abdominal desmoid tumor should be a differential diagnosis for a new single lesion in patients with GIST."
"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, also known as malignant schwannoma, are rare soft tissue sarcomas. They commonly invade axial sites and rarely do they occur in the thorax. Herein, we present the case of an enormous metastatic multilobulated intrathoracic malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor that was first misdiagnosed as desmoid fibromatosis and successfully resected for palliative purpose."
?
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis following thoracotomy is rare and has been previously reported only in <20 cases; however, it might mimic chest wall recurrence of previous cancer and needs differential diagnosis. When the tumor location corresponded to the thoracotomy incision, we should consider desmoid-type fibromatosis as a differential diagnosis."
"We report an unusual case of low-grade fibromatosis-like metaplastic carcinoma (LG-FLMC) of the breast. This exceedingly rare epithelial breast malignancy has been reported only 68 times in the past 20 years, and is classified as a subtype of metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC). It is a locally aggressive tumor with a low potential for lymph node and distant metastases, but with a tendency to recur after excision. Here we describe a less common presentation of LG-FLMC, provide its molecular characterization, discuss the major differential diagnosis and bring a short review of the literature. CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old woman presented with a self-palpated breast lump that had discordant radio-pathological features. While imaging results were compatible with an infiltrative malignancy, on core needle biopsy (CNB) a sharply delineated lesion composed by a bland-looking population of spindle cells was observed; excision was recommended for final diagnosis. Histology of the resection specimen showed small areas of epithelial differentiation and foci of peripheral invasion. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a co-immunoreactivity for epithelial and myoepithelial markers in the spindle cell component. Mutation analysis with a capture-based next generation sequencing method revealed pathogenic mutations in GNAS, TERT-promotor and PIK3R1 genes. A diagnosis of LG-FLMC was rendered. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of a broad differential diagnosis, exhaustive sampling and the use of a broad immunohistochemical panel whenever dealing with a low-grade spindle cell lesion in the breast, and provides further insights into the molecular background of LG-FLMC."
"Spontaneous disease stabilization of desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) has been demonstrated in many reports, and the watchful waiting approach without any frontline treatment is becoming popular as an initial management strategy. In this study, we aimed to assess the disease stabilization rate and identify predictive factors for disease stabilization of DF in patients with conservative treatment. Methods: We reviewed 76 patients with sporadic extra-abdominal DF who were managed with frontline conservative treatment in our institute. The minimum follow-up was 12 months. Stabilization was defined as radiological evidence of no change or continuous decrease in size of the tumor for six months or more. The primary endpoint was stabilization of DF. Possible patient-, disease-, and treatment-related factors predictive of disease stabilization were analyzed with multivariate analysis. Results: At final follow-up, 54 of the 76 tumors (71%) were stable, and mean time to stabilization was 30.4 months (range, 7 to 112 months). On Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the spontaneous stabilization rate was 25.4% at one year, 52.7% at two years, and 70.9% at three years. The mean time to spontaneous stabilization was longer in patients with </= 40 years of age (p = 0.022) or recurrence (p = 0.041). On multivariate analysis with the Cox proportional hazard method, recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.79; p = 0.041) and younger age (HR, 2.04; p = 0.022) were identified as independent prognostic factors for longer time to disease stabilization. Conclusions: Frontline conservative treatment seems to be the optimal treatment for most patients with DF. Younger patients or those with recurrence may require longer time to spontaneous disease stabilization."
"The purpose of this systematic review is to assess and compare the efficacy of surgical treatment for patients with asymptomatic extra-peritoneal desmoid-type fibromatosis to the wait-and-see policy by evaluating (1) the exacerbation rate (exacerbation; recurrence after surgery or progressive disease following non-surgical treatment) and (2) treatment-associated complications in extra-peritoneal desmoid-type fibromatosis. METHODS: We evaluated documents published between 1 January 1990 and 31 August 2017. The risk of bias in the selected literature was analyzed using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool. Quality of evidence was evaluated using Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. RESULTS: One prospective cohort study, four case-control studies and five case series studies were identified. Meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the exacerbation rate after treatment on one prospective cohort study and four case-control studies. In comparing surgical and non-surgical treatments, the exacerbation rate was significantly higher in the surgical treatment group (odds ratio: 1.32, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.73, P = 0.05). However, in the case series study, the recurrence rate was 23.4% for the surgical treatment group, while the progressive disease rate was 28.1% for the non-surgical treatment group. The postoperative complication rates associated with surgical treatment in the two studies were 20.8 and 17.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: When considering the exacerbation rate, non-surgical treatment might be appropriate for asymptomatic patients with extra-peritoneal desmoid-type fibromatosis. However, if patients with tumor-related symptoms opt for surgery, including those who face difficulties due to the presence of tumors, it is important to fully explain to them the possibility that the recurrence rate and treatment-associated functional failures may increase depending on the site of occurrence."
"Desmoid tumors are rare soft tissue tumors. Wide local excision has been the standard surgical treatment for desmoid tumors. However, this procedure results in high local recurrence rates, so non-surgical treatments should be considered. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of radiation therapy on patients with desmoid tumors, especially those with unresectable disease. METHODS: We evaluated studies published between 1 January 1990 and 31 August 2017 and cited in PubMed and Ichushi (in Japanese). All studies evaluating the effect of radiation therapy on desmoid tumors were included. Data regarding radiation dose, recurrence and adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: Among 218 identified studies, only 6 were finally included in this review. Local control was achieved in 253 of 317 patients with unresectable or unresected tumors who underwent definitive radiation therapy (the crude rate of local control was 79.8%). Toxicity was evaluated in patients who underwent definitive radiation therapy or surgery plus radiation therapy. One of the most common acute complications was skin toxicity. Frequent late complications of radiation therapy included fibrosis/contracture/joint stiffness, skin disorders, lymphedema and pain. Six patients developed secondary malignancies in the radiation field. CONCLUSIONS: In patients treated unsuccessfully with surgery, watchful waiting and pharmacotherapy, radiation therapy may be an option as salvage therapy because of the high rate of local control. Because desmoid tumors frequently develop in young individuals, children and young patients who receive radiation therapy for the treatment of desmoid tumors should be followed up on a long-term basis with periodic monitoring for late radiation toxicities."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF, aggressive fibromatosis) is a non-metastasizing mesenchymal neoplasm of deep soft tissue with a tendency towards local recurrence. Genetic alterations affecting canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling are reported in the majority of DTF. While most sporadic DTF harbor somatic mutations in CTNNB1, germline mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) are known to occur in hereditary DTF types (FAP, Gardner-Syndrome). Additional single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in AKT1 (E17K) and BRAF (V600E) were reported in pediatric DTF with potential clinical implications. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) in a large cohort of 204 formalin-fixed DTF samples, comprising 22 pediatric cases (patients age </=18 years). The mutational status was correlated with clinicopathological characteristics. Overall, deleterious CTNNB1 mutations were detected in 89% of DTF, most frequently affecting the serine/threonine phosphorylation sites T41 and S45 of beta-catenin. While the T41A CTNNB1 mutation was significantly more often identified in the mesenterial localization, DTF originating from extra-intestinal sites more frequently harbored the S45P CTNNB1 alteration. Beyond common mutations in CTNNB1, additional SNVs were demonstrated in 7% of the DTF cohort and in 18% of the pediatric DTF subgroup. The mutational spectrum included deleterious mutations in AKT1 (G311S/D and T312I), ALK (R806H and G924S), AR (A159T), EGFR (P848L), ERBB2 (H174Y), IDH2 (H354Y), KIT (V559D), RET (T1038A), SDHA (R325M), and SDHD (R115W), as characterized by in silico prediction tools. In conclusion, our study indicates that DTF may harbor a broader mutational spectrum beyond CTNNB1 mutations, comprising targetable alterations including the herewith first reported imatinib-sensitive KIT V559D mutation in DTF."
"To make recommendations on the indications for molecular testing regarding the diagnosis, prediction of prognosis, and treatment selection in adult patients with s oft tissue sarcomas (STS) excluding gastrointestinal stromal tumour. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This guideline was developed by the Cancer Care Ontario's Program in Evidence-Based Care (PEBC) and the Sarcoma Disease Site Group (DSG). The medline, embase, and Cochrane Library databases, main guideline websites, abstracts of relevant annual meetings, and PROSPERO databases were searched (January 2005 to October 2016). Internal and external reviews were conducted, with final approval by the PEBC and the Sarcoma DSG. RESULTS: Based on the available evidence, we made three S trong Recommendations, 14 Recommendations, 9 Qualified Statements, and seven No Recommendations. The three Strong Recommendations include: i) MDM2 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is recommended as a sensitive and specific test to differentiate patients with atypical lipomatous tumour/well-differentiated liposarcoma, or dedifferentiated liposarcoma from lipoma or other STS in the differential diagnosis; ii) SS18 (SYT) break-apart by FISH or SS18-SSX (SYT-SSX) fusion by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction is recommended as a sensitive and specific test to differentiate patients with synovial sarcoma from other sarcomas; iii) CTNNB1 S45F mutation by polymerase chain reaction is recommended as a prognostic factor for poor recurrence-free survival in patients with desmoid tumours. CONCLUSION: This guideline may serve as a framework for the thoughtful implementation of molecular studies at cancer centres and other jurisdictions. Some of the recommendations may need to be updated when new evidence appears in the future."
"This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and treatment methods for intra-abdominal aggressive fibromatosis. Methods: We reviewed the clinical data from 16 patients who were diagnosed with intra-abdominal aggressive fibromatosis and were admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital between March 1983 and September 2018. Results: Among the 16 patients, 11 patients presented with a hard smooth abdominal mass with clear borders and a diameter of 4.3-25.0 cm. Six patients had a history of abdominal surgery and 3 patients had a history of familial adenomatous polyposis. Computed tomography imaging revealed a slightly dense mass with mild-to-moderate enhancement. Of all the 16 patients, 11 patients underwent surgical treatment and no recurrence occurred in 10 case after complete resection while recurrence occurred in 1 case after partial resection. Two patients underwent surveillance and 3 patients received cytotoxic drugs treatment, and no disease progression was observed via imaging during their follow-up. Conclusions: Intra-abdominal aggressive fibromatosis is histologically benign tumor with high local recurrence rate. Surgery is an effective treatment and complete resection is essential in reducing the local recurrence rate."
"Desmoid tumors are rare malignancies derived from myofibroblasts, which can cause significant morbidity due to life-threatening invasion of local structures. Risk factors include familial adenomatous polyposis, antecedent surgical trauma and estrogen exposure. We described a previously healthy 27-year-old female in whom a desmoid tumor developed 2 years after a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was performed for the treatment of obesity. Computed tomography scan demonstrated a 16-cm complex density intra-abdominal mass. Exploratory laparotomy was performed, revealing a mass firmly adherent to the Roux limb, as well as the jejunojejunostomy and distal portion of the bilopancreatic limb. En bloc resection of the mass and the Roux limb was required, as well as reconstruction of the Roux-en-Y anatomy. This case describes a unique, long-term complication of bariatric surgery, in light of a growing population of patients with altered gastric anatomy."

"A 68-year-old man who was on treatment for pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex complained a worsening of sputum. Although he archived negative sputum culture two months ago, sputum culture tests revealed the newly isolation of Mycobacterium abscessus repeatedly. Chest computed tomography showed newly-appeared extra-pulmonary mass lesion in contact with a cyst at the bottom of his right lung. From the results of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, we first suspected loculated pleural effusion due to Mycobacterium abscessus infection. A thoracoscopic examination was performed as the right pneumothorax developed, and the pleural lesion was successfully resected and diagnosed as an intrathoracic desmoid tumor. Intrathoracic desmoid tumor is very rare, and this is the first report of a case with pulmonary Mycobacterium abscessus disease."
"Desmoid tumors of the small bowel wall are rare tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. The signs and symptoms ranging from non-specific to severe abdominal pain to the sensation of a mass and abdominal fullness. We present the case of a 48-year-old man who presented 3 years post-one-anastomosis gastric bypass (mini-gastric bypass) with vague abdominal pain and early satiety of one-month duration. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed a well-defined compressive mass in the left hypochondrium. A laparoscopic exploration was performed, but it was converted into a laparotomy due to the huge size of the mass. The desmoid tumor at the gastrojejunal anastomosis was resected, followed by a Roux-en-Y reconstruction. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged on the seventh day post-operation. He did not show any signs or symptoms suggestive of complications or recurrence during his follow-up."

"We report a case of an intraabdominal desmoid tumor that occurred at a gastro-pancreatic lesion with spontaneous cystic features, and present the successful laparoscopic resection of the tumor. CASE PRESENTATION: A 20-mm retroperitoneal cystic mass with a solid component was found adjacent to the stomach and pancreatic body in a 52-year-old woman with no history of familial adenomatous polyposis. Laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with wedge resection of the stomach was performed, and complete resection was achieved without intraoperative and postoperative complications. Histopathological examination by immunohistochemistry enabled diagnosis of a desmoid tumor that had originated from the stomach and invaded the pancreatic parenchyma with a spontaneous cystic change. We herein report an extremely rare case of an intraabdominal desmoid tumor with a spontaneous cystic change. CONCLUSION: Regardless of its rarity, desmoid tumor should be included in the preoperative differential diagnosis of a cystic intraabdominal mass, and laparoscopic function-preserving surgery may be an optimal treatment option."
"The management of desmoid-type fibromatosis has considerably evolved these last years, toward first-line active surveillance then systemic or local symptomatic treatment in case of aggressive tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging is the modality of choice in each of these treatment settings. It needs multiparametric approach taking into account mainly the tumor size, and T2-weighted signal that is correlated with histological composition and clinical behavior. A volumetric approach should be favored for the evaluation of tumor size change. The interest of paramagnetic contrast injection and tumor enhancement requires further investigation."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis, aggressive fibromatosis) is a rare and locally aggressive monoclonal, fibroblastic proliferation characterised by a variable and often unpredictable clinical course. Previously surgery was the standard primary treatment modality; however, in recent years a paradigm shift towards a more conservative management has been introduced and an effort to harmonise the strategy amongst clinicians has been made. We present herein an evidence-based, joint global consensus guideline approach to the management of this disease focussing on: molecular genetics, indications for an active treatment, and available systemic therapeutic options. This paper follows a one-day consensus meeting held in Milan, Italy, in June 2018 under the auspices of the European Reference Network for rare solid adult cancers, EURACAN, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma Group (STBSG) as well as Sarcoma Patients EuroNet (SPAEN) and The Desmoid tumour Research Foundation (DTRF). The meeting brought together over 50 adult and pediatric sarcoma experts from different disciplines, patients and patient advocates from Europe, North America and Japan."

"Benign soft tissue lesions are 300 times as common as soft tissue sarcomas; hence, the likelihood of confusion is high. Lesions that are larger than 5cm, deep, show infiltrative growth, or recur despite benign histology are suspicious for soft tissue sarcoma. The biopsy incision must be carefully chosen; in large lipomas, atypical lipomatous tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Lymphomas can be misdiagnosed and treated as undifferentiated soft tissue sarcoma. Vascular tumors and epithelioid lesions require more attention in histopathologic diagnostics and staging. Inflammatory lesions and aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumor) should also be borne in mind. In general, staging should be adapted to the underlying tumor biology. Neoadjuvant and adjuvant multimodal therapy must be discussed with the patient and used in a targeted manner. Superficial infiltrating sarcomas are prone to intralesional resection and may require intraoperative frozen section histology. If plastic reconstruction is necessary, a two-step procedure after proven tumor-free margins can be beneficial. Cavities and seromas, tight sutures, and closing the wound with clips are particularly critical. Wound drains at the thigh, pelvis, and groin should be left longer. Early revision in cases of hematoma or critical wound healing have proven beneficial. Adjuvant therapies are best planned before discharge from hospital. Overall, tumor-specific follow-up can significantly reduce the disadvantages of a recurrence resection."
"Aggressive fibromatosis or desmoid fibromatosis is a soft tissue neoplasm which is non-metastatic in nature. Among all soft tissue tumours, it comprises of 3% cases and is more common in females as compared to males. Objective of our study was to evaluate the treatment outcomes of extra abdominal fibromatosis in patients who were treated in our setup and determine the recurrence patterns. Methods: It is retrospective cohort of 15 patients that were treated in section of Orthopaedics, department of surgery, Aga Khan University hospital, Karachi from January 1990 to December 2015. It included all adult patients of age >18 years with biopsy proven extra abdominal aggressive fibromatosis. Data was analysed on SPSS 22 version.. Results: Out of 15 patients, there were 7 males (46.7%) and 8 females (53.3%). Median age was 22 years. Majority of patients [10 (66.6%)] had upper limb lesion. On initial biopsy we had 11 (73.3%) cases of primary fibromatosis while 2 (13.3%) were recurrent and 2 (13.3%) were spindle cell carcinoma. The median (IQR) follow-up time of the participants was 3 (2-3) months. Complications occurred in 8 (53.3%) patients. A significant difference was observed in the haemoglobin levels before and after surgery with a mean difference of 2.74 (p-value<0.001). Recurrence of disease occurred in 4 (26.7%) patients and all of these patients who had recurrence underwent 2nd surgery versus 1 of the participants who had second surgery without recurrence and this was a significant difference (p value <0.004). Conclusion: Extra abdominal fibromatosis is commonly found among younger age groups, affecting females more as compared to males. Less than half of the patients had recurrence of disease in our study and intra-operative and postoperative complications are common surgical outcomes and our study results are compatible with previously reported literature."
"The diagnosis of bland-looking spindle cell lesions of the breast is often challenging because there is a close morphological and immunohistochemical overlap among the different entities. The present review will discuss reactive spindle cell nodule/exuberant scar, nodular fasciitis, inflammatory pseudotumor, myofibroblastoma (classic type), lipomatous myofibroblastoma, palisaded myofibroblastoma, benign fibroblastic spindle cell tumor, spindle cell lipoma, fibroma, leiomyoma, solitary fibrous tumor, myxoma, schwannoma/neurofibroma, desmoid-type fibromatosis, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, low-grade fibromatosis-like spindle cell carcinoma, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor and low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma arising in the breast parenchyma. The pathologist should be aware of each single lesion to achieve a correct diagnosis to ensure patient a correct prognostic information and therapy. Accordingly representative illustrations and morphological/immunohistochemical diagnostic clues will be provided."
"Desmoid tumors (TDs) are derived from mesenchymal stem cells and their pathogenesis is strongly linked to the Wingless/Wnt cascade where the deregulation of beta-catenin plays a major role. A mutation of the CTNNB1 encoding beta-catenin is found in the majority of sporadic TD cases and constitutional mutations of APC have been described in heritable forms in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Estrogens could also play a role in pathogenesis and this is the basis for the use of hormone therapy. Other signaling pathways have been involved in the development of TDs such as Notch, Hedgehog, JAK/STAT, PI3 Kinase/AKT and mTOR. Metalloproteases are expressed in TDs and play a role in invasiveness. TGF-ss, as a growth factor, stimulates the transcriptional activity of beta-catenin. Future studies will need to focus on better describing and understanding the immune environment of TDs. One of the major difficulties for the experimental study of TDs is the virtual absence of a preclinical model, either in vitro or in vivo. This is partly why the interactions between the different signaling pathways presented here and their consequences for the development of TDs are still poorly understood."
"nodular and cranial fasciitis, fibrous hamartoma of infancy, nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, nuchal-type and Gardner fibromas, desmoid fibromatosis, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and giant cell fibroblastoma, solitary fibrous tumor, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma, infantile fibrosarcoma, low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, and sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma. While some of these neoplasms characteristically arise in the head and neck, others are rarely described in this anatomic region and may therefore be particularly difficult to recognize. Distinction between these entities, however, is crucial, particularly as the molecular pathogenetic basis for these neoplasms are being rapidly elucidated, in some instances allowing for targeted therapeutic approaches."
"The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefit of using quantitative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping in the initial diagnosis and post-therapeutic follow-up of extremity soft tissue masses. Patients and Methods: This study included 90 patients with extremity soft tissue masses. The DWI was obtained with 3 b values, including 0, 400, and 800 s/mm(2). Calculation of the ADC value of the lesion was done by placing the region of interest (ROI) to include the largest area of the lesion. ADC values were compared with the histopathology. Eighteen patients had posttherapeutic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: Benign masses, fibromatosis, and malignant soft tissue masses had mean ADC values of 1.18 +/- 1.0191 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s; 1.31 +/- 0.245 x 10(-3) mm(2)/sec; and 1.3 +/- 0.7 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively. Myxomatous malignant masses had an ADC value of 2.6 +/- 0.55 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, while nonmyxomatous malignant masses had an ADC value of 1.1 +/- 0.8 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s. ADC cutoff value between benign and non-benign (including malignant and locally aggressive masses) was 0.6 x 10(-3) mm(2)/sec with 98.3% sensitivity and 50% specificity (P = 0.5123). The statistical difference between malignant soft tissue masses (mean ADC 1.309 +/- 0.723 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) and fibromatosis masses (mean ADC value 1.31 +/- 0.245 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) using a comparative T-test proved to be of poor significance level (P value ~ 0.9757). Nine patients with soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) had pre and post-therapeutic MRI examinations showing a mean increase of the recorded ADC values by about 0.28 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s in the post-therapy study as compared with the recorded initial pretreatment values. Analysis of the post-therapy follow-up studies of fibromatosis showed that lesions with favorable response to chemotherapy or radiotherapy (8/12) exhibited significantly lower ADC values than those showing progressive disease course. Conclusion: DWI with ADC mapping of extremity soft tissue tumors are so complicated that they alone may not be of much value in differentiating between benign and malignant tumors; however, it can be used as a tool for monitoring response to treatment."

"Desmoid tumours (DT) are commonly associated with Gardener's syndrome. Their surgical resection may be complicated by their close proximity to major vessels, multiple organ involvement, and frequent local recurrence. Multivisceral transplantation (MVTx) is an alternative treatment for patients with intestinal and liver failure. In patients with DT closely associated with renal structures but without end-stage kidney disease, concomitant excision of the patient's own kidney, ex vivo tumour resection with nephron-sparing surgery, or autotransplantation has been proposed. Case Presentation: A 36-year-old Caucasian female weighing 60 kg with Gardener's syndrome with a history of abdominal surgery was presented to our department with progressive abdominal distention associated with paroxysmal pain. With the use of CT, the patient was diagnosed with a mass arising from the mesenterial region. The patient had normal kidney function and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The patient was indicated for MVTx. Management and Outcome: After 16 months on the waiting list, the patient received a multivisceral graft from a deceased donor. Following the restoration of graft vascular flow, the patient's right kidney was removed and the DT dissected ex vivo before autotransplantation into the right pelvic fossa. The patient received immunosuppressive, antithrombotic, and antibiotic treatment. There was no acute rejection, though the patient experienced pulmonary infection, dysphagia, and oesophageal reflux with fungal infection. The patient had required temporary dialysis for acute renal failure for 75 days. One year after the surgery, nausea and violent vomiting caused delayed gastric emptying caused by spastic pylorus. Clinical improvement was achieved using gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM). Conclusion: MVTx with kidney autotransplantation is a feasible treatment option in patients with familiar adenomatous polyposis complicated by an abdominal DT. Precise tumour dissection with nephron-sparing surgery was carried ex vivo. G-POEM was used to relieve MVTx-related gastroparesis. The patient had no disease reoccurrence after one-year follow-up."
"To describe a rare case of aggressive fibromatosis of the stomach and discuss the differential diagnoses. METHODS: A 47-year-old man presented with nonspecific abdominal pain. Gastroscopy revealed stomach wall swelling. An antral gastrectomy was performed. Histological examination revealed spindle-shaped cells and morphology typical of aggressive fibromatosis. We performed a literature search to identify conditions with features similar to those of aggressive fibromatosis. RESULTS: Aggressive fibromatosis does not metastasize, but it is locally invasive and has a tendency to relapse; however, our patient has not had recurrence > 1 year after surgery. Aggressive fibromatosis of the stomach may be confused with an inflammatory fibroid polyp, a gastrointestinal stromal tumor, schwannoma, leiomyoma, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, scirrhous carcinoma of the stomach, follicular dendritic cell sarcoma, inflammatory malignant fibrous histiocytoma, myofibroma/myofibromatosis, and solitary fibrous tumor of the stomach. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive fibromatosis of the stomach is a rare spindle cell tumor that must be differentiated from a variety of conditions."
"Desmoid tumors are locally aggressive tumors that have a high rate of reoccurrence, even after resection. Percutaneous cryoablation is an effective alternative treatment with less associated risk. A patient in the fifth decade of life with a history of ductal carcinoma-in-situ, status post bilateral mastectomy and silicone implant placement, presented with a palpable mass in the left breast, core biopsy proven to be a desmoid tumor underneath the implant. The patient underwent two cryoablation procedures in a six-month period. During both procedures part of the implant was included in the ablation zone without any negative effects on the implant. Cryoablation is a feasible treatment option for desmoid tumors adjacent to silicone breast implants."
"Desmoplastic fibroma of bone (DFB), a bone tumor, is considered to be an osseous counterpart of desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF). Herein, we report a case of DFB with CTNNB1 point mutation. The 5-year-old male patient had complained of trismus and pain in the jaw. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass in the left mandible. Radical treatment involved surgical resection. Microscopically, the lesion consisted of a bundle-like proliferation of uniform spindle-shaped cells with abundant collagenous stroma, which resembled DF. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed intranuclear accumulation of beta-catenin in the tumor cells. Based on clinical and histologic analysis, we diagnosed the patient as having DFB. We examined the CTNNB1 and APC sequence and found an A-to-G transition at codon 41 of CTNNB1; i.e., Thr was substituted by Ala. Our findings suggest that the dysregulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is related to the tumorigenesis of some cases of DFB. This hypothesis indicates that there are some cases of DFB in which nuclear positive expression of beta-catenin is useful for diagnosis."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) frequently arises in patients with neuromuscular choristoma (NMC). We hypothesize that NMC-associated DTF occurs in soft tissues innervated by the NMC-affected nerve, and arises from CTNNB1-mutated (myo) fibroblasts within or directly adjacent to the NMC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of patients treated at our institution was performed for patients with biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of NMC-DTF. Clinical presentation, physical examination, electrodiagnostic findings and radiological features (MR and FDG PET/CT images for each NMC-DTF) and pathologic re-review of available materials were analyzed. A literature review was also performed. RESULTS: Eight patients from our institution met the inclusion criteria. All patients presented with neuropathic symptoms and soft tissue or bone changes in the nerve territory innervated by the NMC. All MR images (N=8 cases) showed the characteristic features of NMC, and also showed direct contact between unifocal (N=5) or multifocal (N=3) DTF(s) and the NMC-affected nerve NMC. FDG PET/CT (N=2 cases) showed diffuse, increased FDG uptake along the entire affected nerve segment, contiguous with the FDG-avid DTF. In all cases, the DTFs arose in the soft tissues of the NMC-affected nerve's territory. No patient developed DTF at any other anatomic site. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that NMC-DTF arises solely within the NMC-affected nerve territory, and has direct contact with the NMC itself. Based on all these findings and the multifocality of NMC in several cases, we recommend imaging and surveillance of the entire NMC-affected nerve (from spine to distal extremity) to identify clinically-occult DTF in patients with NMC."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a rare type of soft-tissue tumor originating from connective tissue of the fascia or aponeurosis, which exhibits aggressive growth, high likelihood of relapse and less frequent distant metastasis. The present study aimed to predict the recurrence rate and time by retrospectively analyzing the clinical data (sex, age and recurrence time), imaging findings [tumor location, maximum diameter, border, computed tomography (CT) enhancement ratio, magnetic resonance enhancement ratio and T2 signal ratio] and pathological features (Ki-67 and microscopic margin) in a total of 102 cases of pathologically confirmed desmoid-type fibromatosis. The risk ratio of each factor was calculated using the Cox proportional hazards regression model and the cumulative recurrence-free survival rate was determined using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. The cohort comprised of 73 females and 29 males, with mean age of 32.86+/-12.64 years (range, 6-78 years). The 1-year and 2-year recurrence rate was 31 and 54%, respectively. The median age at recurrence was 29 years. Univariate analysis indicated that sex, maximum tumor diameter, CT enhancement ratio and Ki-67 had a significant effect on the recurrence time. Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that sex, maximum tumor diameter, Ki-67 and T2 signal ratio were independently associated with the time of recurrence, and the risk ratios were 0.424, 1.100, 1.084 and 1.268, respectively. Therefore, in male patients with a larger maximum tumor diameter, positivity for Ki-67 and a higher T2 signal ratio, desmoid-type fibromatosis was more likely to recur after surgery."
"NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3 and NOTCH4 are transmembrane receptors that transduce juxtacrine signals of the deltalike canonical Notch ligand (DLL)1, DLL3, DLL4, jagged canonical Notch ligand (JAG)1 and JAG2. Canonical Notch signaling activates the transcription of BMI1 protooncogene polycomb ring finger, cyclin D1, CD44, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A, hes family bHLH transcription factor 1, hes related family bHLH transcription factor with YRPW motif 1, MYC, NOTCH3, RE1 silencing transcription factor and transcription factor 7 in a cellular contextdependent manner, while noncanonical Notch signaling activates NFkappaB and Rac family small GTPase 1. Notch signaling is aberrantly activated in breast cancer, nonsmallcell lung cancer and hematological malignancies, such as Tcell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large Bcell lymphoma. However, Notch signaling is inactivated in smallcell lung cancer and squamous cell carcinomas. Lossoffunction NOTCH1 mutations are early events during esophageal tumorigenesis, whereas gainoffunction NOTCH1 mutations are late events during Tcell leukemogenesis and Bcell lymphomagenesis. Notch signaling cascades crosstalk with fibroblast growth factor and WNT signaling cascades in the tumor microenvironment to maintain cancer stem cells and remodel the tumor microenvironment. The Notch signaling network exerts oncogenic and tumorsuppressive effects in a cancer stage or (sub)typedependent manner. Smallmolecule gammasecretase inhibitors (AL101, MRK560, nirogacestat and others) and antibodybased biologics targeting Notch ligands or receptors [ABT165, AMG 119, rovalpituzumab tesirine (RovaT) and others] have been developed as investigational drugs. The DLL3targeting antibodydrug conjugate (ADC) RovaT, and DLL3targeting chimeric antigen receptormodified T cells (CARTs), AMG 119, are promising anticancer therapeutics, as are other ADCs or CARTs targeting tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 17, CD19, CD22, CD30, CD79B, CD205, Claudin 18.2, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)2, FGFR3, receptortype tyrosineprotein kinase FLT3, HER2, hepatocyte growth factor receptor, NECTIN4, inactive tyrosineprotein kinase 7, inactive tyrosineprotein kinase transmembrane receptor ROR1 and tumorassociated calcium signal transducer 2. ADCs and CARTs could alter the therapeutic framework for refractory cancers, especially diffusetype gastric cancer, ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer with peritoneal dissemination. Phase III clinical trials of RovaT for patients with smallcell lung cancer and a phase III clinical trial of nirogacestat for patients with desmoid tumors are ongoing. Integration of human intelligence, cognitive computing and explainable artificial intelligence is necessary to construct a Notchrelated knowledgebase and optimize Notchtargeted therapy for patients with cancer."
"About 15 % of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis ""PAF"" develop one or more desmoid tumors in their lifetime. These are benign mesenchymal tumors with local aggressivity but with no potential for metastases. Most of the desmoids tumors result from a sporadic genetic anomaly in the beta catenin gene. When related to familial adenomatous polyposis or ""PAF"", this mutation is not present, and the patients must be sent in genetic counselling. The PAF is a dominant autosomic illness related to a germinal mutation in the APC gene. Sometimes, these tumors can be the first manifestation of the illness. The diagnosis in a context of PAF can be easily done by imaging, but a pathological confirmation is needed. These tumors raise a therapeutic problem because of their heterogeneity and the absence of predictive biomarkers along illness evolution. The identification of prognostic biological and clinical factors would make easier the selection of patients requiring first-line treatment, as spontaneous remissions have also been observed in patients with FAP whom which an active surveillance could also be a valid therapeutic option. The particularity of desmoids tumors associated to PAF lies in their predominantly intra-abdominal location and the risk of complication. In the last ten years, surgery has largely given way to conservative treatments such as chemotherapy and more recently to tyrosine kinase inhibitors that have shown their efficacy with a significant improvement in progression-free survival of patients."
"Locoregional therapy for advanced or recurrent desmoid tumor is part of our therapeutic armamentarium. Radiation therapy at a dose of 56Gy is feasible and has led to favorable results despite limited prospective data available. Cryoablation is a novel, very promising technique that may be applied in the same clinical picture of advanced, progressing or recurrent disease, in the hands of trained teams. All these options have to be discussed in sarcoma tumor boards due to the rarity of the disease and the expertise needed."
"Inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene is the initiating event in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients. Up to 90% of FAP patients show intestinal tumors and other extracolonic malignancies including hepatoblastomas, desmoid tumors, and brain cancer. APC mutation mice (Apc(Min/+) mice) develop benign polyps in the intestinal tract. It has been reported that small numbers of Apc(Min/+) mice develop breast carcinomas. Here, we found that approximately 1.6% of Apc(Min/+) mice suffered skin neoplasm. The results demonstrated that these skin tumors are not derived from intestinal adenomas. Sequencing of skin tumors of Apc(Min/+) mice and Apc(Min/+) mice skin. The data showed that somatic mutations and gene expression levels changed greatly in skin tumors compared to control. Similarly, APC mutation accounts for 27% in the patients of nonmelanoma skin carcinomas in cancer database, and two above genes mutation coexist was observed in all patients. Furthermore, using gene mutation reagent (DMBA)-treated Apc(Min/+) mice skin, the skin epithelium and glandular begin hyperplasia in Apc(Min/+) mice. These findings revealed that the somatic mutation hit on the germline mutation increase the tumor incidence, suggesting that the somatic mutation should be avoided if the germline mutation exists in one body."
"Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) represents a heterogeneous group of aggressive primary breast cancers that can show differentiation into carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements. Due to its rapid growth, this malignancy can replace precursor lesions, which remain unknown in most cases. Herein, we describe a MBC presenting as a deceptive post-biopsy hematoma. Histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluation of the primary tumor revealed a squamous cell carcinoma arising in a background of squamous metaplasia of lactiferous ducts (SMOLD). In the absence of ductal carcinoma in situ, we consider SMOLD as a nonobligatory precursor of MBC. The tumor showed 'dedifferentiation' into spindle, mucin-producing, osteoclast-like giant cell and fibromatosis-like carcinoma. Next-generation sequencing revealed the driver mutations HRAS(Q61R) and PIK3R1(c.1738_1745+2del) in addition to MYH11(S638L) and amplification of ERCC5 and FGF14, which were potential contributors to tumor phenotype. Tumor dedifferentiation was probably facilitated by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) with aberrant expression of platelet and endothelial adhesion molecule-1, leading to early metastasis via hematogenous route rather than lymphatic. The co-occurrence of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway abnormalities along with EMT could mediate divergent growth in breast cancer."
"Desmoid-type fibromatoses (or desmoid tumors) are entities of intermediate biological potential and are locally invasive. Radical surgery, as state of the art therapy, is frequently limited by incomplete resections. Hormone modifying therapies are promising but further research is required. Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose Polymerase-1 (PARP-1), a DNA repairing enzyme, might be a pathogenetic factor and could become a potential target for therapy as shown by the successful treatment of selected carcinomas and sarcomas by PARP-inhibition. In this study, we investigated the expression of estrogen receptors (ER) alpha (1) and beta (2), progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), as well as PARP-1 via immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR in 69 tissue samples of desmoid tumors. Immunohistochemistry was quantified using the Immunoreactivity Score (IRS). Overall expression patterns were correlated with clinical-pathologic parameters to determine their value as a prognostic factor. Among the investigated hormone receptors only ERbeta showed partial cytoplasmic reactivity. PARP-1 revealed variable nuclear positivity with IRS ranging from 0 to 6. Univariate survival analysis showed that higher expression of estrogen receptor 1 was associated with shorter disease-free survival (p=0.005). Uni- (p=0.03) and multivariate (p=0.003) analyses of mRNA data revealed that higher PARP-1 expression correlated with earlier recurrence. According to this study PARP-1 expression is associated with poorer prognosis, that is faster recurrence, highlighting the possibility of PARP-1-targeting agents as a therapeutic option. Hormone receptors were of minor prognostic relevance in this study."
"Patients with ruptured, perforated or fistulized (RPF) sarcomas commonly have issues such as sepsis and malnutrition and are usually unsuitable for oncologic resection in the emergency setting. We present our approach for managing a series of patients and the outcomes which were achieved with multidisciplinary care. METHODS: We reviewed records of patients referred to the section of sarcoma surgical oncology. Clinicopathologic factors, preoperative and operative interventions as well as short-term oncologic outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were identified between 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2018. Median age was 42.8 years. Histologies were; Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (7), desmoid (4), spindle cell tumor (2), dedifferentiated liposarcoma (2), and nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (1). Five patients had preoperative sepsis, 8 received antimicrobials, and 50% required hospitalization with a median stay of 21 days. Total parenteral nutrition was administered to 5 (31.3%) patients. Median tumor size and estimated blood loss were 13.1 cm and 350 mL respectively. No perioperative mortality occurred. Two patients have expired at a median follow-up of 16.1 months. CONCLUSION: Preoperative optimization, including the use of percutaneous drains, and antibiotics to control sepsis, where necessary, can lead to eventual oncologic resection with acceptable morbidity and no short-term mortality for patients with RPF sarcomas."
"The treatment modality for desmoid-type fibromatosis has shifted from surgery to conservative treatment. This systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose chemotherapy with methotrexate and vinblastine for patients with extra-abdominal desmoid-type fibromatosis. METHODS: We searched the pertinent literature from January 1990 to August 2017. Two reviewers evaluated and screened the literature independently for eligibility and extracted data. We evaluated the quality of body of evidence and made a recommendation according to the Grading of Recommendations Development and Evaluation methodology. RESULTS: The search yielded 40 studies, 9 of which were included after the first and second screenings. There were three prospective case series but no randomized controlled trials among the nine studies. There was no case-control report (vs. no treatment). According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria, the mean response rate (complete remission or partial response) was 36% (11-57%). Including stable disease, namely, clinical benefit was consistently as high as 85% (69-100%). Mean adverse event rate of G3 or G4 according to CTCAE was 31%. One study reported improvement of pain (87.5%) because of this chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of this chemotherapy was convincing. However, the overall evidence was weak, and this chemotherapy is not covered by insurance in Japan; we only weakly recommend low-dose chemotherapy with methotrexate and vinblastine in patients with extra-abdominal desmoid-type fibromatosis."
"Desmoid tumors, also known as aggressive fibromatosis, are extremely rare, accounting for less than 3% of soft-tissue sarcomas and less than 0,03% of all neoplasms. The diagnosis is usually delayed because of the lack of specific symptoms, and can sometimes lead to serious and, even fatal complications. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 27-year-old male patient presenting with the clinical picture of acute appendicitis. During the operation, we found a tumor in the jejunum with a necrotic zone and perforation on its surface, causing hemorrhagic effusion into the abdominal cavity and subsequent peritonitis. The tumor was removed with negative margins via resection of the small bowel. The final histological result showed aggressive fibromatosis. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive fibromatosis remains a serious problem with the possibility of locally aggressive behavior with high rates of recurrence. Sometimes, its clinical and macroscopic recognition can be immensely tricky. As shown by our patient, on rare occasions, desmoid tumors can lead to acute surgical abdomen requiring an emergency operation."
"Desmoid is a locally aggressive fibroblastic neoplasm, typically showing a heterogeneous solid mass, and its pathogenesis is multifactorial, including surgical scars. We herein report a rare case of an intra-abdominal desmoid, consisting of solid and cystic components covered with epithelial linings, that emerged after distal gastrectomy. The preoperative diagnosis was inconclusive, so laparotomy was performed. Histopathology of the solid component showed proliferating spindle cells, which were positive for beta-catenin in their nuclei. Clinicians need to bear in mind that desmoids can appear in a solid-cystic form, and immunostaining of beta-catenin should be applied for tumors that emerge around postoperative wounds."
"The objective of this study was to develop an alternative method of non-contrast monitoring of tissue ablation during focused ultrasound treatment. Desmoid tumors are benign but locally aggressive soft tissue tumors that arise from fibroblast cells. Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has emerged as an alternative to conventional therapies, showing promising results in reduction of tumor volume without significant side effects. The gold-standard assessment of the reduction of viable tumor volume post-treatment is non-perfused volume (NPV) and evaluation of NPV is typically performed with post-treatment gadolinium enhanced MR imaging. However, as gadolinium cannot be repeatedly administered during treatments, there is a need for alternative non-contrast monitoring of the tissue to prevent over and under treatment. Methods: Double-echo and multi-echo images were acquired before, during and after the MRgFUS treatment. T2 maps were generated with an exponential fit and T2 maps were compared to post-treatment post-contrast images.Results: In all five MRgFUS treatment sessions, T2 mapping showed excellent qualitative agreement with the post-contrast NPV.Conclusions: T2 mapping may be used to visualize the extent of ablation with focused ultrasound and can be used as a predictor of NPV prior to the administration of contrast during the post-treatment assessment."
"The role of patient groups has grown steadily stronger since the first General Meeting of cancer patients in 1999 and the emergence of the rare diseases issue in the mid-eighties. This article demonstrates the role of a patient group (SOS DESMOIDE) gathering people suffering from a rare disease (the desmoid tumor) in the stimulation of scientific and medical research as well as the improvement of patient care, information and support provided to patients. It substantiates these elements with numerous socio-medico-psychological surveys, scientific publications and medical research implemented by medical teams and supported, even sometimes initiated, by SOS DESMOIDE. This research effort illustrates the significant impact of a partnership between patients and physicians-researchers on medical and scientific breakthroughs in a specific pathological field."
"We summarize here available data about systemic treatments of desmoids tumors, as well in adult patients as pediatric patients. Until 2018, the level of evidence associated with these treatments (NSAI, hormonal therapies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, chemotherapy) was very low, based on retrospective studies or non-randomized phase 2 trials with limited number of cases. In 2018-2019, 2 large randomized trials have been published, including one large superiority phase 3 trial comparing sorafenib to placebo. This trial clearly demonstrates the clinical benefit of sorafenib over placebo (level of evidence IA). To conclude, wait-and-see policy must be the first-line approach, systemic treatment is indicated in case of disease progression. Randomized trials are feasible in this exceptional disease."
"After an adapted imaging, the diagnosis of a desmoid tumor (DT) is provided by a percutaneous microbiopsy, with a molecular analysis for beta-catenin or APC gene mutation. The therapeutic strategy must be decided in a specialized multidisciplinary tumor board (MTB). Surgery is no longer the first-line treatment for a DT. Except within a surgical complication, active surveillance is offered to the majority of patients, since more than half stabilize or regress after an initial progression, whether the location is peripheral or intra-abdominal. If the localization and/or volume are likely to be functional or life-threatening, medical induction therapy is discussed in MTB, before a local treatment whose potential sequelae would be definitive. Incomplete unplanned resection, recurrence, pregnancy or desmoids occurring in a polyposis context are no longer routine surgical indications. In an emergency setting (occlusion, peritonitis), it is discussed to treat only the mechanical complication and leave the DT in place, if its resection would lead to too much digestive resection, especially in patients who have already undergone colectomy for polyposis. The best indications for surgery are patients who have parietal locations with significant and documented progression, because surgery can be easily completed at the cost of an acceptable morbidity. In localizations where surgery would cause sequelae, medical treatment or other regional loco treatments are discussed in MTB."
"Desmoid tumors (DTs), derived from the abdomen, are a type of rare and aggressive borderline tumor exhibiting high recurrence and malignant potential. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinicopathological and molecular characteristics of abdominal DT in a Chinese population and to provide clues for selecting the optimal treatment strategy for different types of abdominal DT. The clinicopathological data of 15 consecutive patients with DT was collected. Matched fresh-frozen tumor tissues and peripheral blood samples were used to detect mutations of adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC), beta-catenin (CTNNB1) and MutY DNA glycosylase (MUTYH) using Sanger sequencing. Pearson's test was conducted to analyze the differences between sporadic DT and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) associated with DT. Time to progress (TTP) and overall survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. A review of the patient clinicopathological characteristics revealed that FAP-associated DT exhibited a higher rate of abdominal surgery history (P=0.011), with no significant differences in any other characteristics. Sequencing revealed that mutations in the APC, CTNNB1 and MUTYH genes were common in DT, and only one patient harbored no mutations in these genes. Survival analyses revealed that patients with FAP exhibited shorter TTP (P=0.030). Log-rank test demonstrated a tendency towards shorter TTP in the cases where an R2 resection was performed (P=0.072) and a tendency towards poor prognosis in the cases of DT associated with FAP (P=0.087). In conclusion, Abdominal DTs were prone to occur in patients with FAP with a history of abdominal surgery. Mutations in the APC, CTNNB1 and MUTYH genes were detected in patients with DTs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of abdominal DT occurrence in patients with MUTYH-associated FAP. The prognosis of DT associated with FAP may be worse compared with that of sporadic DT."
"This meta-analysis (PROSPERO CRD42018100653) uses individual patient data (IPD) to assess the association between recurrence and CTNNB1 mutation status in surgically treated adult desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) patients. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The majority of sporadic DTF tumors harbor a CTNNB1 (ss-catenin) mutation: T41A, S45F, and S45P or are wild-type (WT). Results are conflicting regarding the recurrence risk after surgery for these mutation types. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed on June 6th, 2018. IPD from eligible studies was used to analyze differences in recurrence according to CTNNB1 mutation status using Cox proportional hazards analysis. Predictive factors included: sex, age, mutation type, tumor site, tumor size, resection margin status, and cohort. The PRISMA-IPD guideline was used. RESULTS: Seven studies, describing retrospective cohorts were included and the IPD of 329 patients were used of whom 154 (46.8%) had a T41A mutation, 66 (20.1%) a S45F mutation, and 24 (7.3%) a S45P mutation, whereas 85 (25.8%) patients had a WT CTNNB1. Eighty-three patients (25.2%) experienced recurrence. Multivariable analysis, adjusting for sex, age, and tumor site yielded a P-value of 0.011 for CTNNB1 mutation. Additional adjustment for tumor size yielded a P-value of 0.082 with hazard ratio's of 0.83 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48-1.42), 0.37 (95% CI 0.12-1.14), and 0.44 (95% CI 0.21-0.92) for T41A, S45P and WT DTF tumors compared to S45F DTF tumors. The effect modification between tumor size and mutation type suggests that tumor size is an important mediator for recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Primary sporadic DTFs harboring a CTNNB1 S45F mutation have a higher risk of recurrence after surgery compared to T41A, S45P, and WT DTF, but this association seems to be mediated by tumor size."
"APC gene pathogenic variants are characterized by a lifetime risk of nearly 100% to develop a colorectal carcinoma. International guidelines suggest a prophylactic surgery in the second decade. METHODS: A descriptive analysis was performed evaluating a surgical series of adolescent patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) enrolled in the prospectively maintained hereditary polyposis registry. RESULTS: Thirty-eight adolescent patients (median age 16 years; range, 7-19) underwent laparoscopic prophylactic surgery. APC gene pathogenic variants were detected in all patients, and six patients were proband. No patients were converted to open surgery. Median postoperative stay was five days (4-16). Early postoperative complications were one dural puncture and one anastomotic leakage. Regarding late complications, we observed one patient having small bowel obstruction 56 months after surgery. Pathological reports showed one patient with pTis adenocarcinoma in two separate sites; 33 patients with low-grade dysplasia, four with high-grade dysplasia. One patient developed a desmoid tumor 37 months after surgery. After a median follow-up of 40.5 months, no patients died or had a second abdominal surgery because of cancer in rectal stump. CONCLUSIONS: Rectal sparing surgery was the first choice in the major respect of patients' quality of life. Laparoscopic prophylactic surgery for FAP is well accepted from adolescents. It represents a safe option due to the low incidence of post-surgical desmoids and quick postoperative recovery."
"The exposure of the peritoneum to desiccation during surgery generates lasting damage to the mesothelial lining which impacts inflammation and tissue repair. We have previously explored open abdominal surgery in mice subjected to passive airflow however, operating theatres employ active airflow. Therefore, we sought an engineering solution to recapitulate the active airflow in mice. Similarly, to the passive airflow studies we investigated the influence of humidified-warm carbon dioxide (CO2) on this damage in the context of active airflow. Additionally, we addressed the controversial role of surgery in exacerbating desmoidogenesis in a mouse model of familial adenomatous polyposis. Methods: An active airflow mouse-operating module manufactured to produce the equivalent downdraft airflow to that of a modern operating theatre was employed. We quantified mesothelial cell integrity by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) sampled from the peritoneal wall that was subjected to mechanical damage or not, with and without the delivery of humidified-warm CO2. To explore the role of open and laparoscopic surgery in the process of desmoidogenesis we crossed Apc(min/) (+) C57Bl/6 mice with p53 (+/-) mice to generate animals that developed desmoid tumors with 100% penetrance. Results: One hour of active airflow generates substantial damage to peritoneal mesothelial cells and their microvilli as measured at 24h post intervention, which is significantly greater than that generated by passive airflow. Use of humidified-warm CO2 mostly protects the mesothelium that had not experienced additional mechanical (surgical) damage at 24h. Maximal damage was evident in all treatment groups regardless of flow or use of gas. At day 10 mechanically-damaged peritoneum remains in mice but is essentially repaired in the gas-treated groups. Regarding desmoidogenesis, operating procedures did not increase the frequency of desmoid tumors but their frequency correlated with time following surgery but not age of mice. Conclusions: Active airflow generates more peritoneal damage than passive airflow and is reduced significantly by the use of humidified-warm CO2. Introduced peritoneal damage is largely repaired in mice by day 10 with gas. Desmoid tumor incidence is not increased substantially by surgery itself but rises over time following surgery compared to non-surgery mice."
"Clinical experience suggests a high prevalence of emotional distress in patients with desmoid tumor (DT). We examine longitudinal Distress Assessment and Response Tool (DART) scores to estimate prevalence and persistence of distress, and compare cross-sectional data between DT and malignant sarcoma cohorts, to identify predictors of distress. METHODS: Patients with DT completed DART at: T1-diagnosis, T2-during, T3-<6 months, and T4->/=6 months, post-treatment. DART includes patient-reported outcome measures of physical symptoms (ESAS-r), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and social difficulties (SDI-21). Descriptive prevalence and persistence of anxiety, depression, and wellbeing are reported, and mixed model regression analyses determine predictors of distress. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2018, a total of 152 DART screens from 94 patients with DT were completed (T1: n = 44, T2: n = 31, T3: n = 22, T4: n = 55). Patients had a mean age 40 years, 78% were female and DT locations were abdominal wall (48%), extremity (30%), and mesentery (22%). Moderate to severe ESAS-r scores (>/=4) persisted at T4 for anxiety (20%), depression (13%), and poor wellbeing (31%). Compared to 402 patients with malignant sarcoma, patients with abdominal wall sited DT reported severe PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores twice as frequently. Abdominal wall location, female sex, history of mood problems, and psychosocial concerns were significant predictors of anxiety, depression, and poor wellbeing in DT. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with DT experience persistently high emotional distress compared to patients with malignant sarcoma. Women with abdominal wall DT, prior mood, and current psychosocial concerns need early attention within multidisciplinary treatment settings to reduce persistent distress."
"Retroperitoneal desmoid-type fibromatosis (RPDF) is a rare mesenchymal neoplasm, and it covers a broad spectrum of aggressive monoclonal, fibroblastic proliferation. There is no evidence-based or established optimal treatment available for this intriguing disease yet. Therefore, we here investigated the clinicopathological characteristics, surgical, and survival outcomes in RPDF among Chinese patients.Patients with histologically confirmed RPDF were retrospectively studied from 2010 to 2018 within the West China Hospital of Sichuan University. Demographics, clinicopathological characteristics, treatment, and survival outcome data were collected.Of the 29 cases of RPDF, 19 were females. Tumor diameter ranged from 4 to 40 cm, with a median of 10 cm. Of these patients, surgical resection was the primary treatment adopted for RPDF in 26 cases; while 3 patients underwent watchful waiting. In surgical group, complete and incomplete macroscopic resection was achieved in 21 (80.77%) and 6 (19.23%) cases, respectively. Totally, 21 (80.77%) cases underwent multi-visceral resection. With a median follow-up duration of 48 months, 11 patients experienced tumor progression for the entire cohort. Tumor progression was observed for those patients with incomplete and complete macroscopic resection in 2/5 (40.0%) and 6/21 (28.6%) cases, respectively. In the watchful waiting group, there were no documented cases of RPDF regression. The progression-free survival rate was 86.1%, 71.5%, and 62.3% at 1-, 2-, and 3-years, respectively.RPDFs are rare types of tumor, which have characteristically varied natural histories. Surgical resection had a relative favorable outcome, but some patients were associated with burden of significant surgical complications."

"Although the use of ionizing radiation in malignant conditions has been well established, its application in benign conditions has not been fully accepted and has been inadequately recognized by health care providers outside of radiation therapy. Most frequently, radiation therapy in these benign conditions is used along with other treatment modalities, such as surgery, in instances where the condition causes significant disability or could even lead to death. Radiation therapy can be helpful for inflammatory/proliferative disorders. This article discusses the current use of radiation therapy in some of the more common benign conditions."
"Bone sarcomas are rare tumors arising in bone, representing only a small fraction of solid malignant tumors. Desmoids are benign, infiltrative soft tissue neoplasms. Because of their scarcity and a paucity of data, the management of these tumors can be challenging, especially for clinicians who infrequently encounter these tumors. This article reviews the current literature regarding the diagnosis, work-up, and treatment of these uncommon mesenchymal tumors."

"Desmoid tumors (or aggressive fibromatosis) are locally infiltrative connective-tissue tumors that can arise in any anatomic location; they can be asymptomatic, or they can result in pain, deformity, swelling, and loss of mobility and/or threaten visceral organs with bowel perforation, hydronephrosis, neurovascular damage, and other complications. Existing clinical trial endpoints such as the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1) and progression-free survival are inadequate in capturing treatment efficacy. This study was designed to develop a novel clinical trial endpoint by capturing patient-reported outcomes (PROs). METHODS: Following best practices in qualitative methodology, this study used concept elicitation (CE) interviews to explore desmoid patients' perspectives on key disease-related symptoms and impacts. Qualitative analysis was performed to determine the relative frequency and disturbance of symptoms and impacts as well as other characteristics of these concepts. A draft PRO scale was then developed and tested with cognitive interviewing. Information from the interviews was subsequently incorporated into the refined PRO scale. RESULTS: CE interviews with desmoid patients (n = 31) helped to identify salient concepts and led to a draft scale that included symptom and impact scales. Cognitive interviews were completed with additional patients (n = 15) across 3 phases. Patient input was used to refine instructions, revise and/or remove items, and modify the response scale. This resulted in an 11-item symptom scale and a 17-item impact scale. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first disease-specific PRO instrument developed for desmoid tumors. The instrument is available as an exploratory endpoint in clinical trials. This study highlights the feasibility and challenges of developing PRO instruments for rare diseases."
"Due to the rarity and varied natural history of desmoid-type fibromatosis, evidence-based treatment standards for this disease remain lacking. This study evaluated outcomes in patients with desmoid-type fibromatosis managed at a Canadian institution over two decades. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records of 227 patients with desmoid-type fibromatosis referred from 1990 to 2013 were retrospectively reviewed to investigate management strategies including active surveillance, surgery, radiation therapy, cryoablation, and systemic therapy, including tamoxifen and chemotherapy. RESULTS: Thirty-two per cent of cases were men, median age 40 years, median tumour size 5.4 cm. Initial treatments were surgery (79%), tamoxifen (13%), radiation therapy (5.0%), chemotherapy (1.8%) and cryoablation (1.2%). Active surveillance was used upfront in 26% of cases, most after 2005. At a median follow-up of 77 months, one patient died of disease, 13 died of unrelated causes and the remainder were alive with no evidence of disease (56%), stable/responding disease (33%) or progressive disease (4%). The recurrence rate was 25% after upfront surgery. Response rates and disease control rates were 40% and 76% for active surveillance; 68% and 96% for radiation therapy; 31% and 67% for tamoxifen; and 53% and 80% for chemotherapy. On univariable analysis, factors associated with a higher recurrence after initial surgery were young age (P = 0.012), male gender (P = 0.012) and extremity location (P = 0.005). On multivariable analysis, only young age was significantly associated with recurrence risk (P = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Active surveillance was associated with spontaneous regression and long-term disease control consistent with other studies. Primary radiation therapy appeared to provide a similar response and disease control compared with systemic treatments and may be a viable option for patients who are not candidates for surgery or active surveillance."
"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) will often require abdominal surgical intervention for indications not directly related to their IBD. Because these patients often have a history of multiple previous abdominal operations and/or ostomies, they are at increased risk for incisional and parastomal hernias. They may also have develop symptomatic cholelithiasis, chronic pain, or desmoid disease. All of these potentially surgical issues may require special consideration in the IBD population."
"/dtrf.iamrare.org), more than 300 desmoid tumor patients have consented to the Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation Natural History Study and completed the Participant Profile. The majority of the respondents are between the ages of 21 and 50 years (76%), female (81.2%), White (91.5%), and live in the United States (47.1%). The majority of tumors are in the lower or upper extremity, (22.9%) followed closely by abdominal desmoid tumors (21.5%). Most are willing to donate specimens (89.9%) and participate in trials (97.2%). Ongoing efforts are addressing the demographic differences between the respondents and non-respondents and any selection bias based on access to the registry and study. The Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation Natural History Study is built on the largest desmoid tumors registry and has recruited more desmoid tumors participants since launching in September 2017. It will serve to fill desmoid tumors knowledge gaps and assist other researchers in their recruitment efforts for additional studies."
"Infantile myofibromatosis (IM) is an aggressive neoplasm composed of myofibroblast-like cells in children. Although typically localized, it can also present as multifocal disease, which represents a challenge for effective treatment. IM has previously been linked to activating somatic and germline point mutations in the PDGFRbeta tyrosine kinase encoded by the PDGFRB gene. Clinical panel-based targeted tumor sequencing of a tumor from a newborn with multifocal IM revealed a novel PDGFRB rearrangement, which was reported as being of unclear significance. Additional sequencing of cDNA from tumor and germline DNA confirmed a complex somatic/mosaic PDGFRB rearrangement with an apparent partial tandem duplication disrupting the juxtamembrane domain. Ectopic expression of cDNA encoding the mutant form of PDGFRB markedly enhanced cell proliferation of mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) compared to wild-type PDGFRB and conferred tumor-forming capacity on nontumorigenic 10T1/2 fibroblasts. The mutated protein enhanced MAPK activation and retained sensitivity to the PDGFRbeta inhibitor imatinib. Our findings reveal a new mechanism by which PDGFRB can be activated in IM, suggest that therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors including imatinib may be beneficial, and raise the possibility that this receptor tyrosine kinase might be altered in a similar fashion in additional cases that would similarly present annotation challenges in clinical DNA sequencing analysis pipelines."
"To analyze the appearance of primary and recurrent aggressive fibromatosis (AF) on MRI with a focus on configuration and to determine potential risk factors for recurrences detected on MRI follow-up scans. METHODS: From 79 consecutive patients with histologically proven diagnosis of AF, 39 patients underwent a minimum of four 1.5 T MRI follow-up scans after resection of primary AF between 2008 and 2018. The primary and recurrent tumors were radiographically examined for configuration, limitation and extent on MRI. Epidemiological data and loco-regional subcutaneous edema, muscle edema and post-operative seroma were included. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 39 +/- 2.6 years. Primary and recurrent AF most often occurred in the thigh. The main appearance of primary AF was significantly most often fascicular (p = 0.001-0.01) with heterogeneous and marked contrast enhancement. 21 % (n = 8) of the patients developed recurrences of AF. A fascicular configuration with homogeneous/heterogeneous contrast enhancement was the main appearance of recurrent AF, but recurrent AF appeared nodular, polycyclic, ovoid or streaky/flat as well. Recurrent AF significantly most often occurred within the first 9 months after primary tumor resection (p = 0.009), especially in patients up to 25 years of age (RR = 6.1; 95 % CI: 1.8-20.9; p = 0.004). The cases of recurrent AF were altogether significantly smaller than the primary tumors (p = 0.001). Post-treatment subcutaneous and muscle edema were present in 77 % and 56 %, respectively. Patients with muscle edema after primary tumor resection had a significantly higher risk for AF recurrences (relative risk ratio (RR) = 1.8; 95 % CI: 1.16-2.8; p = 0.0096). There was no significant difference detected in patients with complete or incomplete resection of the primary tumor. CONCLUSION: Primary and recurrent aggressive fibromatosis has a mostly fascicular configuration, but may appear ovoid, nodular, streaky/flat or polycyclic as well. High risks for tumor recurrences are detected for patients up to 25 years of age, patients within the first 9 post-operative months and patients with muscle edema after primary tumor resection. KEY POINTS: . Primary aggressive fibromatosis mostly has a fascicular configuration with heterogeneous contrast enhancement. . Recurrent aggressive fibromatosis usually has a fascicular configuration with heterogeneous/homogeneous contrast enhancement. . Patients within the first 9 post-operative months and up to 25 years of age have a significantly higher risk for recurrences. . Muscle edema after resection of primary aggressive fibromatosis is associated with a significantly higher risk for recurrences. CITATION FORMAT: . Sedaghat S, Surov A, Krohn S et al.

"Introduction. Myofibromas are rare tumors of pericytic lineage, typically affecting children, and are sometimes aggressive. A subset of sporadic and familial myofibromas have activating variants in PDGFRB. The relationship of myofibroma and PDGFRB to the NOTCH pathway has not yet been described. Methods. Ten myofibroma cases were sequenced with a targeted panel of 447 genes, including copy number variation and selected fusions. Immunohistochemical analysis of total NOTCH3 and activated NOTCH3 was assessed for all 10 myofibroma cases, and a series of histologic mimics (n = 20). Results. Alterations identified by next-generation sequencing included PDGFRB sequence variants in 8/10 cases (80%), a NOTCH3 variant in 1/10 cases (10%), and a NOTCH2 variant in 1/10 cases (10%). All 10 cases also showed a pattern of low-amplitude (1.5- to 2-fold) copy number alterations including gains in PDGFRB and NOTCH3. Ten of 10 myofibromas (100%) showed cytoplasmic staining for total NOTCH3 and 9 of 10 cases (90%) showed nuclear staining for activated NOTCH3. Within the control cohort of histologic mimics, 3 of 3 nodular fasciitis cases (100%) were positive for activated and total NOTCH3, and the remaining 17 cases were negative for pan NOTCH3, while 3 of 3 desmoid-type fibromatosis cases (100%) showed patchy weak nuclear staining for activated NOTCH3. Discussion. Our findings suggest a common pathway of PDGFRB/NOTCH3 activation in myofibromas, even in cases that lack PDGFRB sequence variants. These results support the pericytic lineage of myofibroma. Identification of the characteristic genomic alterations or immunohistochemical staining pattern may facilitate a difficult pathologic diagnosis, and support the use of targeted treatments."

The diagnosis of desmoid fibromatosis or other spindle cell tumors in the sinonasal region is very rare in children and needs to be thoroughly confirmed with immunohistochemical and/or molecular tests. We report 2 patients with such rare tumors and describe the use of next-generation sequencing in their evaluation. A 3-year-old female had a 4.4-cm midline nasal cavity mass involving the bony septum and extending into the base of the skull bilaterally. The moderate cellular fibroblastic proliferation revealed areas of thick keloid-like collagen bands and other areas with myxoid edematous stroma. Deep targeted sequencing identified a novel G34V mutation in the CTNNB1 gene consistent with desmoid fibromatosis. An 11-month-old male infant presented with a right nasal mass that extended through the cribriform plate into the anterior cranial fossa and involved the right ethmoid sinus and adjacent right orbit. Histology revealed an infiltrative atypical fibrous proliferation with focal calcifications that was negative for CTNNB1 and GNAS mutations. A novel RET E511K variant was identified in the tumor and later was also found in the germline and hence rendered of unknown significance. Both cases highlight the utility of next-generation sequencing in the evaluation of pediatric sinonasal spindle cell tumors that may have overlapping pathologic features. Reporting of rare or novel variants in tumor-only sequencing should be cautiously evaluated in children and pairing with germline sequencing may be needed to avoid the pitfall of assigning uncommon variants.
"Gardner's syndrome is a clinical subgroup of Familial Adenomatosus Polyposis, arare, autosomal disease. It is characterized by gastrointestinal polyps and extra-intestinal manifestations including multiple osteomas, skin and tissue tumours. The authors describe a case of a male patient, and discuss the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with Gardner's syndrome. We conclude that the knowledge of rare syndromes is very important for the correct treatment."
"To investigate the reconstructive methods and effectiveness of modified pedicled anterolateral thigh (ALT) myocutaneous flap for large full-thickness abdominal defect reconstruction. Methods: Between January 2016 and June 2018, 5 patients of large full-thickness abdominal defects were reconstructed with modified pedicled ALT myocutaneous flaps. There were 3 males and 2 females with an average age of 43.7 years (range, 32-65 years). Histologic diagnosis included desmoid tumor in 3 cases and sarcoma in 2 cases. The size of abdominal wall defect ranged from 20 cmx12 cm to 23 cmx16 cm. Peritoneum continuity was reconstructed with mesh; lateral vastus muscular flap was used to fill the dead space and rebuild the abdominal wall strength; skin grafting was applied on the muscular flap, the rest abdominal wall soft tissue defects were repaired with pedicled ALT flap. The size of lateral vastus muscular flap ranged from 20 cmx12 cm to 23 cmx16 cm, the size of ALT flap ranged from 20 cmx8 cm to 23 cmx10 cm. The donor site was closed directly. Results: All flaps and skin grafts survived totally, and incisions healed by first intention. All patients were followed up 6-36 months (mean, 14.7 months). No tumor recurrence occurred, and abdominal function and appearance were satisfying. No abdominal hernia was noted. Only linear scar left in the donor sites, and the function and appearance were satisfying. Conclusion: Modified pedicled ALT myocutaneous flap is efficient for large full-thickness abdominal defect reconstruction, decrease the donor site morbidity, and improve the donor site and recipient site appearance."

"Ledderhose's disease, also known asplantar fibromatosis, is a rare benign nodular hyperplasia of the plantar aponeurosis. The disease is locally aggressive and can be managed very well conservatively. In patients who present with severe pain on weight-bearing might require surgical excision. Case Report: We would like to report about a case of 40-year-old female with bilateral Ledderhose's disease. She was treated conservatively to no avail. On surgical excision of the fibrosis tissue, the patient gives complete relief of symptoms. In this paper, we would to discuss both the conservative and surgical methods adopted to prevent post-operative complications. Conclusion: Ledderhose disease is a rare benign aggressive disease which presents as nodules over the sole of the foot. The disease is usually manageable conservatively. Wide margin surgical excision of the nodule in severe cases will provide pain-free mobilization and prevent recurrence."
"The behavior of desmoid tumors is unpredictable and varies from spontaneous remission to symptomatic and radiologic progression. This study aimed to evaluate the radiologic and symptomatic course of the disease in patients initially managed with active surveillance. METHODS: Patients with a primary desmoid tumor at any anatomic location diagnosed between 1998 and 2016 were identified in a prospectively maintained database from a single sarcoma reference center in the United Kingdom. Inverse univariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the course of the disease and indications for initiating treatment. RESULTS: The study identified 168 patients with a primary desmoid tumor initially managed with active surveillance. The tumors were located in the abdominal wall (n = 61, 36%), an extremity (n = 51, 30%), chest wall (n = 30, 18%), intra-abdominal site (n = 15, 9%), or elsewhere (n = 11, 6%). Of all the patients, 36% experienced radiologic progressive disease, 36% had stable disease, and 27% regressed. The patients younger than 50 years were more likely to progress (p = 0.046), whereas the patients with chest wall or upper-extremity tumors reported significantly more pain (p = 0.01). Eventually, 46% of the patients proceeded to treatment. The median time to start of treatment after initial surveillance was 31 months, whereas the median follow-up time for the patients not receiving any treatment was 40.5 months. The indications for initiation of treatment were pain (32%), progression (31%), or both (13%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with desmoid tumors can be managed with initial active surveillance, although almost half of patients may eventually need treatment. Pain, tumor progression, or both are the most common indications for the initiation of treatment."
"During a follow-upstudy after the treatment of T cell lymphoma, a 21-year-old man reported an intra-abdominal mass in his right lower abdomen, which was then confirmed using abdominal CT. Therefore, recurrence was suspected due to his medical history. To perform a biopsy, laparoscopic surgery was scheduled, which located the tumor in the mesentery of the terminal ileum, involving the cecum. For this, laparoscopic ileocecal resection was performed. After 7 days, the patient was discharged without complications. Histopathologically, the mass was diagnosed as a desmoid tumor via immunostaining. It is relatively rare that an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor occurs without risk factors in a young man. We herein report a case of an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor, which was successfully treated using laparoscopic surgery."
"Desmoid tumors (DTs) are local aggressive neoplasms, whose therapeutic approach has remained so far unsolved and in many instances controversial. Nowadays, immunotherapy appears to play a leading role in the treatment of various tumor types. Characterization of the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) and immune checkpoints can possibly help identify new immunotherapeutic targets for DTs. We performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) on 33 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections from DT samples to characterize the TME and the immune checkpoint expression profile. We stained for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, FoxP3, CD45RO, CD56, CD68, NKp46, granzyme B, CD27, CD70, PD1 and PD-L1. We investigated the expression of the markers in the tumoral stroma, as well as at the periphery of the tumor. We found that most of the tumors showed organization of lymphocytes into lymphoid aggregates at the periphery of the tumor, strongly resembling tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs). The tumor expressed a significant number of memory T cells, both at the periphery and in the tumoral stroma. In the lymphoid aggregates, we also recognized a significant proportion of regulatory T cells. The immune checkpoint ligand PD-L1 was negative on the tumor cells in almost all samples. On the other hand, PD1 was partially expressed in lymphocytes at the periphery of the tumor. To conclude, we are the first to show that DTs display a strong immune infiltration at the tumor margins, with formation of lymphoid aggregates. Moreover, we demonstrated that there is no PD-L1-driven immune suppression present in the tumor cells."
"Medulloblastomas may occur in a predisposition context, including familial adenomatosis polyposis. Medulloblastomas related to a germline pathogenic variant of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) remain rare and poorly described. Their similarities with sporadic WNT medulloblastomas still require description. METHODS: We performed a multicentric retrospective review of 12 patients treated between 1988 and 2018 for medulloblastoma with an identified or highly suspected (personal or familial history) APC germline pathogenic variant. We report personal and familial history APC gene pathogenic variants whenever available: clinical and histologic characteristics of the medulloblastoma, treatments, and long-term outcome, including second tumor and late sequelae. RESULTS: Medulloblastomas associated with APC pathogenic variants are mainly classic (11/11 patients, 1 not available), nonmetastatic (10/12 patients) medulloblastomas, with nuclear immunoreactivity for ss-catenin (9/9 tested cases). Ten of 11 assessable patients are disease free with a median follow-up of 10.7 years (range, 1-28 y). Secondary tumors included desmoid tumors in 7 patients (9 tumors), 1 thyroid carcinoma, 2 pilomatricomas, 1 osteoma, 1 vertebral hemangioma, and 1 malignant triton in the radiation field, which caused the only cancer-related death in our series. CONCLUSIONS: Medulloblastomas associated with an APC pathogenic variant have an overall favorable outcome, even for metastatic tumors. Yet, long-term survival is clouded by second tumor occurrence; treatment may play some role in some of these second malignancies. Our findings raise the question of applying a de-escalation therapeutic protocol to treat patients with APC germline pathogenic variants given the excellent outcome, and reduced intensity of craniospinal irradiation may be further evaluated."
"Papillary thyroid cancer with desmoid-type fibromatosis (PTC-DTF) is an uncommon tumor characterized by extensive stromal proliferation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts with a small component of PTC. We report a case of PTC-DTF with infiltration of the mesenchymal component of tumor into perithyroidal muscle and early recurrence of desmoid after thyroidectomy, an outcome previously not reported. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 20-year-old man underwent left hemithyroidectomy for a thyroid nodule. Pathology demonstrated a 4.2cm tumor with PTC-DTF with the PTC comprising <10% of the tumor. The stromal component extended into adjacent skeletal muscle. After completion thyroidectomy, histopathology of the right thyroid lobe revealed no malignancy or fibromatosis. Neck MRI 16 months after the initial operation revealed a 10.5cm tumor in the left thyroid bed. Core biopsy and open excisional biopsy showed desmoid-type fibromatosis without PTC. The patient is undergoing chemotherapy of his recurrent desmoid-type fibromatosis. DISCUSSION: In patients with PTC-DTF there is a risk of recurrence of the benign component of the tumor. In recent reports, the role of less aggressive surgery, or even non-surgical management, of patients with recurrent DTF has been emphasized, in particular when extensive surgery may be associated with high risk of functional loss. The management of our patient adheres to modern recommendations for the treatment of DTF. CONCLUSION: Patients with PTC-DTF should be carefully monitored after thyroidectomy for both recurrent PTC and local recurrence of the fibrous component of the tumor."
"We review the role of hormonal therapy in the management of different conjunctive tumors. Progestin and aromatase inhibitors seem active in low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma, but larger case-series are needed. There is no evidence to support the use of hormonal therapy as an adjuvant treatment for low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. We did not find relevant data on the use of hormonal therapy for other uterine sarcomas (e.g., high-grade endometrial sarcoma, undifferentiated uterine sarcoma, and adenosarcoma). Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, anti-estrogens and aromatase inhibitor seem active in advanced aggressive angiomyxoma, but larger studies are warranted. The use of aromatase inhibitor in estrogen-receptor-positive uterine leiomyosarcoma requires further clinical investigation. There is no evidence supporting the use of hormonal therapy in desmoid-type fibromatosis. International collaboration efforts are warranted to better explore the role of hormonal therapies in management of estrogen-receptor-positive uterine leiomyosarcoma, low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma, and aggressive angiomyxoma."

"The use of radiation therapy in the treatment of retroperitoneal sarcomas has increased in recent years. Its impact on survival and recurrence is unclear. METHODS: A retrospective propensity score matched (PSM) analysis of patients with primary retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcomas, who underwent resection from 2000 to 2016 at eight institutions of the US Sarcoma Collaborative, was performed. Patients with metastatic disease, desmoid tumors, and palliative resections were excluded. RESULTS: Total 425 patients were included, 56 in the neoadjuvant radiation group (neo-RT), 75 in the adjuvant radiation group (adj-RT), and 294 in the no radiotherapy group (no-RT). Median age was 59.5 years, 186 (43.8%) were male with a median follow up of 31.4 months. R0 and R1 resection was achieved in 253 (61.1%) and 143 (34.5%), respectively. Overall 1:1 match of 46 adj-RT and 59 neo-RT patients was performed using histology, sex, age, race, functional status, tumor size, grade, resection status, and chemotherapy. Unadjusted recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 35.9 months (no-RT) vs 33.5 months (neo-RT) and 27.2 months (adj-RT), P = .43 and P = .84, respectively. In the PSM, RFS was 17.6 months (no-RT) vs 33.9 months (neo-RT), P = .28 and 19 months (no-RT) vs 27.2 months (adj-RT), P = .1. CONCLUSIONS: Use of radiotherapy, both in adjuvent or neoadjuvent setting, was not associated with improved survival or reduced recurrence rate."
"Desmoid tumors are locally aggressive nonmalignant soft tissue tumors, which frequently recur after therapy. The optimal treatment is still controversial because of the lack of large research. A few studies have reported the effects of other treatments in one lesion when surgery is not possible or would cause notable functional impairment. Our aim was to examine the outcome of radiotherapy (RT) in the treatment of primary or recurrent unresectable desmoid tumors of the neck. Materials: A retrospective analysis was performed on 30 patients between 1/2008 and 12/2017, with 3 primary and 27 recurrent unresectable desmoid tumors of the neck. All cases were reviewed by pathologists. Results: The median follow-up time was 50.5 months (range 2-126 months). Radiotherapy doses varied from 50 to 66 Gy (median 60 Gy, 23/30 patients) with all fraction size of 2 Gy. The objective response rate (ORR: CR or PR) to definitive RT was 56.7% (17/30 patients). On Chi-square statistic, ORR was significantly influenced by tumor size (</=5 cm versus >5 cm) (p = .046). Age (</= 40 versus >40 years) (p = .804), gender (p = .629), and RT dose (</=60 versus >60 Gy) (p = .613) were not significantly associated with ORR. The most common acute side effects of the radiation-related complication were grade 1-2 skin toxicities. Conclusion: Radiotherapy is a valuable option in the management of primary or recurrent unresectable DTs of the neck with good local control. Multi-institutional and prospective studies are warranted to further validate our findings."
"Cryoablation is being more and more often used to treat desmoid tumors. We report our experience of cryoablation as a local and analgesic treatment for inoperable or recurring desmoid tumors. METHODS: This study includes 34 patients who underwent percutaneous cryoablation of 41 desmoid tumors between July 2012 and September 2016. All patients underwent pain assessment using a visual analog scale (VAS) and preoperative imaging. All cryoablation procedures were performed using the same cryoablation system. Patients received clinical and radiological follow-up at 6 months post-procedure, with pain-rating and adverse events being recorded. A long-term follow-up was achieved until 31 December 2018. Disease-free survival at 3 years was also recorded. Radiological tumor response was determined by tumor measurements using RECIST 1.1. RESULTS: Twelve patients benefitted from curative treatment on 100% of the tumor volume, but 22 patients received debulking treatment because of the risk of neighboring structures. Two patients had a postoperative hematoma grade 2 of the CIRSE classification system for complications, and two patients had grade 4 complications involving palsy of the common fibular nerve. Disease-free survival at 3 years was 42.2%. The mean VAS pain scores were 5.7 and 2.4 at pretreatment and 6 months, respectively, showing a mean reduction of 3.3 (p < 0.001). At 6 months, all measured tumor dimensions were significantly lower than pretreatment. CONCLUSION: Cryoablation is an effective therapeutic option for the local treatment and for the analgesic management of desmoid tumors."
"To propose a follow-up strategy for desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) based on tumor growth behavior and the signal on T2-weighted MRI. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 296 MRI studies of 34 patients with histologically proven DF. In each study, tumor volume and T2 signal relatively normal striated muscle were assessed. Volume variation and monthly growth rates were analyzed to determine lesion growth behavior (progressing versus stable/regressing lesions). Growth behavior was correlated with T2 signal, tumor location, beta-catenin status, treatment strategy, and follow-up duration. Interobserver variability of volume measurements and interobserver measurement variation ratio were assessed. RESULTS: There were 25 women and 9 men with a mean age of 39.9 +/- 19 (4-73) years. Mean follow-up time in the patients included was 55 +/- 41 (12-148) months. In progressing lesions, the mean average monthly growth ratio was 10.9 +/- 9.2 (1.1-42.5) %. Interobserver variability of volume measurements was excellent (ICC = 0.96). Mean interobserver measurement variation ratio was 20.4 +/- 23.6%. The only factor correlated with tumor growth behavior was T2 signal ratio (p < 0.0001). Seventeen out of 34 (50%) patients presented a signal change over the threshold of 1 during follow-up. There were five occurrences of secondary growth after a period of stability with a mean delay until growth of 38.2 +/- 44.2 (17-116) months. CONCLUSION: DF growth rate was quantitatively assessed. A threshold for volume variation detection was established. DF growth behavior was significantly related to T2 signal. An evidence-based follow-up strategy is proposed. KEY POINTS: * In progressing desmoid fibromatosis, the mean average monthly growth ratio was 10.9 +/- 9.2%. * Lesions with muscle/tumor T2 signal ratios lower than 1 tended to be stable or regress over time. * Given the interobserver measurement variability and MRI in-plane spatial resolution, a variation higher than 42.6% in tumor volume is required to confirm punctual progression."
"This study aimed to determine the clinical significance of MRI characteristics as a possible predictor of responsiveness to meloxicam treatment in patients with desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF). Additionally, it analysed the correlation between CTNNB1 mutation status and signal intensity of MRI. METHODS: Forty-six patients consecutively treated with meloxicam composed this study. The low-intensity area (LIA) on T2-weighted MRI was determined. We divided patients into two groups based on the efficacy of meloxicam: a clinical benefit group (CB group, including CR: complete response; PR: partial response; and SD: stable disease) and non-clinical benefit group (NB group, including PD: progressive disease). Correlations of the efficacy with LIA and CTNNB1 mutation status with LIA were investigated. RESULTS: In total, 11, 17 and 18 patients showed PR, SD and PD, respectively. The mean LIA ratio before treatment was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in the CB group than in the NB group. For predicting the efficacy, sensitivity was 68%, and specificity was 89% when setting the cut-off value as 20% for LIA. Mean changes in the LIA ratio before and after treatment were significantly higher (P = 0.01) in the CB group than in the NB group. Mean LIA ratio before treatment was significantly lower (P < 0.001) in the S45F mutation group than in the other mutation group. In multivariate analysis, the LIA ratio before treatment was a significant predictor of responsiveness (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: MRI characteristics were a useful predictor of the efficacy of meloxicam in DF patients. It may be possible to predict the clinical outcome more accurately when combined with other factors, such as CTNNB1 mutantion status."
"Desmoid tumors of the extremities often present with pain and functional limitation, but treatment can lead to morbidity and recurrence is common. The impact of treatment with respect to traditional ""oncologic"" metrics (such as recurrence rate) has been studied extensively, with a shift in recent years away from local therapies as first-line management; however, little is known about the association between treatment modality and long-term functional outcomes for patients with this benign disease. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: In a retrospective review of consecutive patients treated at two institutions, we asked: (1) Is event-free survival (EFS) different between patients who undergo local treatment and those who do not for primary as well as for recurrent desmoid tumors? (2) What treatment-related factors are associated with worse Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) function scores at a minimum of 1 year after treatment? METHODS: Between 1991 and 2017, 102 patients with desmoid tumors of the extremities (excluding those of the hands and feet) were treated at two institutions; of those, 85 patients with 90 tumors were followed clinically for at least 1 year (median [range] 59 months follow-up [12 to 293]) and were included in the present analysis. We attempted to contact all patients for administration of PROMIS function (Physical Function Short Form [SF] 10a and Upper Extremity SF v2.0 7a) and Pain Interference (SF 8a) questionnaires. Complete survey data (minimum 1 year follow-up) were available for 46% (39 of 102) of patients with 40 tumors at a median of 125 months follow-up; only these patients were included in PROMIS data analyses. Though there was no formal institutional treatment algorithm in place during the study period, surgical resection typically was the preferred modality for primary tumors; radiation therapy and systemic treatments (including cytotoxic or hormonal agents earlier in the study period, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors later) were often added for recurrent or very symptomatic disease. We coded treatment for each patient into discrete episodes, each defined by a particular treatment strategy: local treatment only (surgery and/or radiation), systemic treatment only, local plus systemic treatment, or observation; treatment episodes rendered at other institutions (that is, before referral) were not included in the analyses. Treatment failure was defined as recurrence after surgical resection, or clinically significant radiologic and/or symptomatic progression after systemic treatment, and EFS was defined as time from treatment initiation to treatment failure or final follow-up. Episodes of treatment for recurrent tumors were analyzed in a pooled fashion, wherein discrete treatment episodes for patients with multiple recurrences were included separately as independent events. We analyzed 56 primary tumors (54 patients), and 101 discrete treatment episodes for recurrent tumors (88 patients). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed separately for the primary and recurrence cohorts, both comparing EFS among patients who received any local treatment (local treatment and local plus systemic treatment groups) versus those who did not (systemic treatment and observation groups). PROMIS function data were analyzed on the bases of patient- and treatment-specific variables, including the PROMIS Pain Interference score as a potential explanatory variable. RESULTS: Within both the primary and recurrence cohorts, there were no differences between the local treatment, systemic treatment, and local plus systemic treatment groups with respect to gender, age, axillary/hip girdle location, or tumor volume. Among primary tumors, 5-year EFS was 44% (95% CI 24 to 80) for the systemic-only group versus 15% (95% CI 5 to 44) for the local treatment group (p = 0.087). Within the pooled recurrence treatment episode cohort, 5-year EFS after systemic-only treatment was 70% (95% CI 52 to 94) versus 56% among patients receiving any local treatment (95% CI 44 to 70; p = 0.46). PROMIS function scores were lowest among patients who underwent two or more resections (39 versus 51 versus 47 for >/=2, 1, and 0 resections, respectively; p = 0.025); among those who received both surgery and radiation at any point, either concurrently or in separate treatment episodes, as compared with those who did not (39 versus 46; p = 0.047); and among those with higher levels of pain interference (38 versus 47 for pain interference scores > 50 versus < 50; p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with local modalities (surgery and/or radiation, with or without additional systemic therapy) did not experience improved EFS as compared with those treated without local modalities; this was the case for both the primary and the recurrent tumor cohorts. However, PROMIS function scores were lowest among patients who underwent two or more surgical interventions and among those treated with surgery and radiation at any time, suggesting that more aggressive local treatment may be associated with poorer long-term functional outcomes. Prospective collection of patient-reported outcomes data at multiple time points will allow for more direct correlations between treatment modality and impact on function and will help to elucidate the ideal management strategy for these benign but often-symptomatic tumors. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study."
"Fibromatosis of the breast is a rare condition that can be locally aggressive. The mainstay of treatment remains wide local excision, with varied adjuvant therapy as needed. The authors describe their experience in the treatment of a series of patients and propose the classification of primary and secondary breast fibromatosis. A single-institution retrospective analysis of patients treated for breast fibromatosis from 2003 to 2017 was completed. Demographic data, pertinent past medical history, and treatment modalities were reviewed. Primary breast fibromatosis was defined as arising in the absence of previous surgery or radiation therapy to the ipsilateral breast. Secondary breast fibromatosis was defined as arising in the setting of previous surgery or radiation therapy to the ipsilateral breast. A total of 16 patients were included with the median age 40 (28-64) years. The average size of the lesion was 6.37 cm (range of 1.5-15 cm). Mean follow-up time was 65 months. Surgical excision was completed in 14 patients, with two recurrences. There were no recurrences in patients with surgical margins >1 cm. Two patients were treated nonsurgically. There were seven patients with primary fibromatosis of the breast and nine patients with secondary fibromatosis of the breast. Fibromatosis of the breast is difficult to diagnose prior to surgical excision. We advocate for the multi-disciplinary treatment of this disease process with an aggressive surgical approach to achieve margins >1 cm."
"Desmoid tumors, also known as aggressive fibromatosis, are fibromuscular neoplasms that arise from mesenchymal cell lines. They may occur in almost all soft tissue compartments. Primary desmoids of the small bowel are rare but potentially serious tumors presenting unique challenges to the general surgeon. We present one case of a 59-year-old man presenting with three months of abdominal distension secondary to a small bowel desmoid. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed an 18-cm mass in the mid-abdomen without obvious vital structure encasement. Percutaneous biopsy of the mass indicated a desmoid tumor. The patient underwent a successful elective exploratory laparotomy with resection and primary enteric anastomosis. Final pathology revealed the mass to be a primary desmoid of the small bowel. His post-operative course was uneventful. At two years after surgery, he is symptom free, and there is no evidence of disease recurrence. Due to the rare nature of primary small bowel desmoids, there are few specific care pathways outlined. This is a challenging pathology to treat that often requires a multidisciplinary team of surgical and medical oncologists."
"There is currently no standard treatment for desmoid tumors (DTs) associated with familial polyposis coli (FAP). Familial adenomatous polyposis in DT patients is sometimes a life-threatening condition. Methods: We enrolled all consecutive patients with FAP treated at Unit of General Surgery and Transplant, University of Naples Federico II and evaluated the incidence of DTs on FAP between 1996 and 2016. Results: We observed 45 consecutive patients with FAP; of these 5 were DT-FAP-associated. All 5 cases with FAP were young women, age 25 to 65 years, previously treated by colectomy. Of these, 4 patients presented a parietal localization and had been treated with a wide surgical exeresis; one patient had an intra-abdominal, mesenteric tumor that was unresectable at laparotomy. We performed CT-guided drainage, ureteral stenting, medical therapy (sulindac+tamoxifene), and chemotherapy (dacarba-zine+doxorubicine).All patients were alive and underwent follow-ups for 5 years post-surgery; only 1 patient with parietal localization showed a local relapse after 2 years. Conclusions: We propose a modulated approach to the single patient with FAP, with surgery as treatment of choice for parietal localization disease and integrating different kinds of therapies (surgery alone or associated with RT, CT) for the intra-abdominal tumor."
"Personalised tumour therapies aim to selectively target pathways and structures to which a tumour shows an oncogenic addiction. OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: This article aims to provide an overview of relevant genetic alterations in bone and soft-tissue tumours, which might serve as potential therapeutic targets for personalised medicines in the future. Recent approaches towards a personalised treatment of various tumours of bone and soft tissues are reviewed. RESULTS: Molecular diagnosis has become an essential tool for the characterisation of bone and soft-tissue tumours. Currently, no targeted therapies are routinely available for bone sarcomas. Denosumab is merely a symptomatic treatment for giant cell tumours of the bone. Imatinib has become the paradigm of a targeted treatment for subgroups of malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Antiangiogenic multikinase inhibitors, various other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and monoclonal antibodies are currently being evaluated in several (sub-)types of soft-tissue sarcomas. Sorafenib showed promising results in the treatment of aggressive desmoid-type fibromatosis. Histology-tailored chemotherapies did not yield superior results in a prospective randomised multicentre trial. CONCLUSION: More in-depth knowledge is required for many sarcomas to link their genetic alterations to tumorigenesis in order to develop efficient personalised treatment strategies. Clinical trial designs need to be adapted to evaluate new therapeutic strategies in these ultra-rare tumours and their various sub-types more efficaciously."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) is an uncommon, benign, collagen-forming soft tissue neoplasm that is characterized by monoclonal myofibroblast cell proliferation and derived from musculoaponeurotic structures. It has a locally invasive pathological behavior and a high potential for recurrence. Fibromatoses with onset in infancy and childhood are characterized with higher cellularity and more aggressive growth. The mainstream management of AF is surgical removal with microscopically lesion-free margins. In advanced cases, radical surgery can lead to function loss and disfigurement. Hence, early diagnosis and management can avoid complications. Although uncommon (two to four cases per million per year are reported), approximately 25 percent of AF incidents occur in children younger than 15 years of age. Pediatric dentists are likely to be the first practitioners to encounter new cases of AF in younger populations and should have knowledge and understanding of this entity. The purpose of this report is to present a rare case of AF affecting the mandible of a young patient."
"Desmoid tumors are monoclonal fibroblastic proliferations arising from soft tissue classified as intra-abdominal, extra-abdominal and abdominal wall types. We present a patient with an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor diagnosed 20 months after laparoscopic resection of rectal cancer. A 70-year-old woman with hematochezia was diagnosed with advanced rectal cancer. Preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by laparoscopic low anterior resection was performed. During follow-up, a nodular soft-tissue density measuring 28 mm was detected in the presacral region. Metastasis from rectal cancer was diagnosed and four courses of chemotherapy were given, including capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab. Computed tomography scan showed that the mass slightly decreased in size and surgical resection was performed. Histopathological examination revealed a proliferation of spindle-shaped cells and collagenous stroma diagnosed as a desmoid tumor. This report highlights the possibility of a desmoid tumor in the differential diagnosis of an intra-abdominal mass found during follow-up after resection of colorectal cancer including following laparoscopic resection."

"A rare case of a jejunal mesenteric pseudocyst treated by robotic resection is reported. A 25-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with intermittent abdominal discomfort which was exacerbated by strenuous physical activities. Physical examination revealed a fluctuant mass without tenderness. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a 4 cm-sized non-enhancing heterogeneous mass on a proximal small bowel loop mesentery. Based on the findings, a differential diagnosis of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor, hematoma, desmoid tumor, and mesenteric cyst was made. Robotic diagnostic laparoscopy was performed to obtain an accurate diagnosis and treatment. Exploration of the cavity revealed a 4 cm fairly mobile mass originating from the mesentery of the jejunum. Segmental resection of the jejunum and its mesentery, including the mass and extracorporeal anastomosis, was performed without any complications. Macroscopically, the mass was cystic and the lumen had grumous material. The final pathological diagnosis was a mesenteric pseudocyst. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course."
"Pediatric peripheral nerve tumors (PNTs) are rare. Most are related to neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) with the potential for malignancy. An ongoing debate occurs about the best approach to such patients. This study describes a cohort of pediatric patients with PNTs and discusses clinical characteristics and surgical treatment. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of seven pediatric patients with eight PNTs surgically treated from 2007 to 2018. Information concerning patient demographics, clinical presentation, PNTs characteristics, treatment choice, and outcome were recorded. RESULTS: All children presented with intense pain and a palpable mass. Three of the eight tumors were associated with a neurological deficit. Among the four patients with NF1, two had a neurofibroma and two a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). Histologically, three of the lesions were a benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor (BPNST), three a MPNST, and one each a desmoid tumor and Ewing's sarcoma. Two of the eight tumors underwent partial tumor excision and six gross total excisions. CONCLUSIONS: Intense pain at rest, day, and/or night, preventing normal activities; a palpable, hard, immobile mass; an intense Tinel's sign related to the lump; clinical evidence of NF1; and high-speed growth of a tumor in the trajectory of the nerve or plexus should alert the clinician to the potential for malignancy. Preoperative biopsy is not indicated when clinical and imaging findings suggest a benign tumor. The surgical management of PNTs must be to achieve total resection, including wide margins with malignant tumors, though this is not always possible."

"Primary leiomyosarcoma (LMS) of vascular origin is a rare lesion, and patients with LMS of vascular origin have poorer prognoses than patients with LMS of other origins. The inferior vena cava is the most commonly affected vessel and accounts for 60% of all vascular cases. However, LMS originating from the ovarian vein is extremely rare, and we are only aware of 15 reported cases. Therefore, we report our experience with a case of LMS originating from the right ovarian vein and review the related literature. CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old Japanese woman with no symptoms was admitted to our hospital because of abnormal findings in a routine abdominal ultrasonography check-up. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a well-defined, lobulated solid mass with a diameter of 5.5 cm in the right retroperitoneal space. The mass exhibited relatively low uptake during (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Based on these findings, the differential diagnosis included a retroperitoneal tumor, such as a desmoid tumor, leiomyoma, LMS, and malignant mesothelioma. Operative findings confirmed that the mass had originated from the right ovarian vessels, and en bloc excision was performed for the mass and the right ovarian vessels. The final pathological diagnosis was LMS originating from the right ovarian vein, and the surgical resection margins were free from tumor cells. After histological findings confirmed the LMS diagnosis, the patient underwent adjuvant radiation therapy and has not exhibited signs of local recurrence or metastasis in the 6 months after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: We encountered a 71-year-old woman with LMS originating from her right ovarian vein. The prognosis of vascular LMS is generally poor. Therefore, careful follow-up will be required for our patient."
"Extra-abdominal desmoid tumours are benign and rare, and lead to a persistent treatment dilemma because of their high recurrence rate and their heterogeneous behaviour. The goal of this retrospective study was to evaluate the results of different treatment modalities for extra-abdominal desmoid tumours at four sarcoma treatment centres. METHODS: The mean follow-up time for the 96 patients included in the study (63.5% female; mean age 38.9 years) was 8.4 years (2.0&ndash;40.5 years). The initial treatments were surgery (n = 44), surgery with radiation (n = 16), watchful waiting (n = 15), radiation only (n = 9), or systemic treatment (n = 12). Patient demographics, tumour sites, and the follow-up status of all patients were reviewed and evaluated for each of the treatment modalities. RESULTS: The local recurrence rate was 45.5% in patients with primary surgical treatment and 37.5% following surgery combined with irradiation. Patients who were treated with radiation alone showed regressive (33.3%) or stable disease (66.6%). Systemic treatment alone resulted in disease progression in 41.7% of our patients. In the watchful waiting group, 73.3% showed stable disease, 20.0% showed spontaneous regression, and 6.7% showed progression after a mean follow-up of 4.1 years (2.0&ndash;11.5 years). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a watchful waiting approach should be the first line treatment in asymptomatic desmoid tumours. However, radiation can help improve local control rates in patients who have undergone surgery. Progression and local recurrence rates following systemic treatment were comparable to those observed in surgery combined with radiation."
"Treatment modality of desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) has changed from surgery with a wide surgical margin to conservative treatment. In this study, tumor characteristics of DF, transition of the treatment modality, and clinical outcome of surgical treatment were analyzed based on data obtained from the bone and soft tissue tumor registry established in Japan. METHODS: Data were collected as registration data and follow-up data. Five hundred and thirty registered cases of DF were identified, including 223 cases with follow-up data with or without surgical treatment. RESULTS: The number of registered patients increased gradually. The frequency of surgical treatment was gradually reduced year by year. The 3-year local recurrence free survival (LRFS) was 77.7%, with tumor location and size tending to correlate with LRFS. Interestingly, there was no significant difference in LRFS between wide and marginal margin (P = 0.34). CONCLUSIONS: The treatment modality has shifted from surgical to conservative treatment, with risk factors for surgical treatment similar to those noted in previous studies. The National registry system is crucial for a rare disease such as DF, and in the future, a population based registry system should be established to better comprehend the actual status of DF."

"Desmoid tumours are locally aggressive tumours associated with substantial morbidity. No systemic treatments are approved for this disease, with methotrexate-vinblastine the only chemotherapy regimen assessed in a clinical trial setting to date. VEGF overexpression is a common feature in aggressive desmoid tumours. Pazopanib is an oral antiangiogenic agent targeting VEGF receptors 1, 2, and 3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-like protein (PDGFR) alpha and beta, and c-KIT tyrosine kinases. We aimed to assess antitumour activity and safety of targeted therapy or combination chemotherapy in progressive desmoid tumours. METHODS: DESMOPAZ was a non-comparative, randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial conducted at 12 centres from the French Sarcoma Group. We enrolled adults (>/=18 years) with progressive desmoid tumours, normal organ function and centrally documented progressive disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 based on two imaging assessments obtained within less than a 6-month interval. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to oral pazopanib 800 mg per day for up to 1 year or to an intravenous regimen combining vinblastine (5 mg/m(2) per dose) and methotrexate (30 mg/m(2) per dose), administered weekly for 6 months and then every other week for 6 months. Randomisation was stratified according to inclusion centre and tumour location. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who had not progressed at 6 months in the first 43 patients who had received one complete or two incomplete cycles of pazopanib. This endpoint was also assessed as a prespecified exploratory endpoint in all patients who had received one complete or two incomplete cycles of methotrexate-vinblastane. Safety analyses were done for all patients who received at least one dose of allocated treatment. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01876082. FINDINGS: From Dec 4, 2012, to Aug 18, 2017, 72 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned (n=48 in the pazopanib group; n=24 in the methotrexate-vinblastine group). Median follow-up was 23.4 months (IQR 17.1-25.5). 46 patients in the pazopanib group and 20 patients in the methotrexate-vinblastine group were assessable for activity. In the first 43 patients assessable for the primary endpoint in the pazopanib group, the proportion of patients who had not progressed at 6 months was 83.7% (95% CI 69.3-93.2). The proportion of patients treated with methotrexate-vinblastine who had not progressed at 6 months was 45.0% (95% CI 23.1-68.5). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events in the pazopanib group were hypertension (n=10, 21%) and diarrhoea (n=7, 15%) and in the methotrexate-vinblastine group were neutropenia (n=10, 45%) and liver transaminitis (n=4, 18%). 11 patients (23%) had at least one serious adverse event related to study treatment in the pazopanib group, as did and six patients (27%) in the methotrexate-vinblastine group. INTERPRETATION: Pazopanib has clinical activity in patients with progressive desmoid tumours and could be a valid treatment option in this rare and disabling disease. FUNDING: GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis."
"Aggressive breast fibromatosis (referred to as a desmoid tumor) is a rare, locally invasive, non-metastasizing tumor with high recurrence rate. The therapeutic modalities range from surgery and radiotherapy to medical treatments. However, the optimal treatment is controversial, especially in a situation of repeated recurrence. Here, we present a case of a patient with aggressive breast fibromatosis with multiple recurrence after surgeries, who underwent high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment effectively without side effects. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of HIFU treatment in aggressive breast fibromatosis, which indicates that HIFU might be a novel, promising modality for this rare disease."
"Desmoid fibromatosis (DF) is a rare fibroblastic proliferation that was historically treated with surgery. We report (a) outcomes using low-dose chemotherapy, methotrexate (MTX), and vinorelbine (VNL) for patients with progressing disease (PD) and (b) whether tumor volume (Vtumor ) and T2 signal on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are more reflective of treatment response compared with maximum tumor dimension (Dmax ) defined by RECIST1.1. METHODS: Patients with biopsy-proven DF, treated with MTX/VNL from 1997 to 2015 were reviewed. MRI for a subset of patients was independently re-evaluated for response by RECIST, Vtumor , and quantitative T2 hyperintensity. RESULTS: Among 48 patients treated for a median 19 months MTX/VNL, only nine (19%) had previous surgery. RECIST-based overall response rate was complete response (CR) 20 (42%) + partial response (PR) 19 (39%), stable disease (SD) 8 (17%), for a clinical benefit rate of 98%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 120 months, (95%CI 84-155 months). Thirty-six (75%) patients had not progressed at a median 38 months from treatment completion. Most common grade 1/2 toxicities included nausea (n = 12, 25%) and fatigue (n = 9,19%) with no grade 3/4 toxicities. In 22 patients with serial MRIs, there was a decrease in Dmax mean by 30%, Vtumor by 76%, and in 19/22 (86%) a decrease in T2 signal intensity. CONCLUSION: Low-dose MTX/VNL for a defined duration has high efficacy with sustained benefit and minimal toxicity for treating DF. Vtumor and T2 signal might better predict treatment response than RECIST."

"BACKGROUND Desmoid tumors are fibrous neoplasms that originate from the musculoaponeurotic structures in the body. Abdominal wall desmoid tumors are rare, but they can be locally aggressive, with high incidence of recurrence. These tumors are more common in young, fertile women. They frequently occur during or after pregnancy. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 63-year-old post-menopausal woman with a desmoid tumor of the anterior abdominal wall. She had no relevant family history. During abdominoplasty, an incidental mass was excised and biopsied, and was identified as a desmoid tumor with free margins. One year later, the patient presented with vague abdominal discomfort and feeling of heaviness. An incision was made through the previous abdominoplasty scar to maintain the aesthetic outcome. A large mass, arising from the abdominal wall and extending intra-abdominally, was excised and was determined to be a recurrent desmoid tumor. CONCLUSIONS Recurrent anterior abdominal wall desmoid tumors in post-menopausal women are rare and locally aggressive, with a high risk of recurrence. During abdominal wall repair in abdominoplasty, desmoid tumor filaments might seed deep intra-abdominally. Therefore, it is necessary to take adequate safe margins before abdominal wall repair. Post-operatively, surgeons should keep a high index of suspicion for tumor recurrence."
"Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is a rare disorder caused by reduced ferrochelatase activity and shows incomplete autosomal dominant inheritance. Meticulous perioperative management can avoid characteristic complications. This report describes a case of a bleeding jejunal tumor in a patient with EPP. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 49-year-old man with a history of EPP was admitted to our department with abdominal distention and severe anemia. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed an abdominal tumor measuring 5cm, originating from the small bowel wall or mesentery. Tumor resection was planned after correction of anemia. Red blood cell transfusion restored his hemoglobin to acceptable levels; however, his liver function worsened. Institution of liver support therapy achieved gradual reduction in his elevated liver enzymes; however, hyperbilirubinemia persisted. He underwent tumor resection on the 12(th) day of hospitalization. Yellow filters were used to avoid operating room light-induced tissue injury. The tumor was located in the jejunum 30cm from the Treitz ligament toward the anal aspect. The histopathological diagnosis was desmoid-type fibromatosis of the jejunum. Postoperatively, his hemoglobin levels were stabilized; however, his serum bilirubin level remained high. His serum bilirubin level gradually decreased following hemin injections (150mg/day). DISCUSSION: Reducing heme synthesis and minimizing protoporphyrin generation are important perioperatively. Additionally, preventing operating room light-induced tissue burns and selecting appropriate anesthestic agents are important during surgery. CONCLUSION: The institution of appropriate treatment and adequate intra- and perioperative measures can ensure safe surgery in patients with EPP even under emergency conditions."
"Desmoid tumors are rare locally invasive, benign neoplasms that develop along aponeurotic structures. Current treatment is complicated by associated morbidity and high recurrence rates. METHODS: A retrospective, single-institution review identified 23 patients (age: 16-77) with extra-abdominal desmoid tumors who received CT-guided percutaneous cryoablation as either a first-line (61%) or salvage (39%) treatment in 30 sessions between 2014 and 2018. Median maximal lesion diameter was 69 mm (range: 11-209). Intent was curative in 52% and palliative in 48%. Contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging was obtained before and after treatment in addition to routine clinical follow-up. RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in all patients. The median follow-up was 15.4 months (3.5-43.4). Symptomatic improvement was demonstrated in 89% of patients. At 12 months, the average change in viable volume was -80% (range -100% to + 10%) and response by modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST) was CR 36%, PR 36%, and SD 28% No rapid postablation growth or track seeding was observed. Four patients underwent repeat cryoablation for either residual or recurrent disease. Two patients sustained a major procedural complication consisting of significant neuropraxia. CONCLUSION: Cryoablation for desmoid tumors demonstrates a high degree of symptom improvement and local tumor control on early follow-up imaging with relatively low morbidity."
"Sarcoma is rare and heterogenous with various subtypes having a different prognostic. Desmoid is a tumour with a local aggressiveness; GIST with KIT mutation responds massively to target treatment as IMATINIB, whereas soft tissue sarcoma and leiomyosarcoma are very aggressive with poor response to systemic therapies. Interventional radiology plays an important role in the diagnosis of sarcomas with image-guided percutaneous core needle biopsy being the most commonly used biopsy technique in the diagnosis of sarcomas. Biopsy access routes discussed with the surgeon, and skin access is tattooed. Surgery is a mainstay of sarcoma treatment; the resection can be large. Indeed, resection objective is R0 because quality of surgical margins impacts local control and survival. Radiotherapy is possible in neoadjuvant or in adjuvant treatment to improve local control rate. Recently radiotherapy enhancer injected percutaneously in soft tissue sarcoma has proven benefit in increasing the rate of R0 complete surgical resection. Several studies showed better local control rate linked with post-operative radiotherapy. In patients affected by oligometastatic disease, complete surgical resection of all metastatic sites is in fact considered the primary treatment because complete remission is critical for cure. The decision making to use local therapies is complex, depends upon diverse presentations and histologies, and should always be taken in a multidisciplinary discussion. Today, percutaneous image-guided treatments with ablation technologies (radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy, microwaves ablation) provide high rate of durable local control for small-sized malignant deposit in many organs including lung, liver and bones. Sarcoma must be managed by multimodality treatment in expert reference centres. Such management has a considerable impact on the prognosis."
"Desmoid tumors are uncommon benign tumors with locally aggressive behavior. Even with aggressive resection with or without radiotherapy, the relapse rate is relatively high. Surgical resection can be challenging especially in large size tumors, as the resultant post-operative wide wall defect can lead to cosmetically undesirable bulging and functional loss. The use of Ultrasound may be useful to aid in radical resection of the desmoid tumor with adequate margins. In our 30-year-old patient with recurrent abdominal wall desmoid tumor, intra-operative ultrasound was utilized in successful resection of the tumor followed by a minimal but adequate margin. The patient has recovered well and within the 6 months follow-up period and has not reported any functional limitations or recurrence."
"Bone resorption, initiated by osteoclasts (OCs), plays an essential role in bone homeostasis. The abnormalities of bone resorption may induce a series of diseases, including osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and aseptic peri-implant loosening. Nirogacestat (PF-03084014, PF), a novel gamma-secretase inhibitor, has been used in phase II clinical trial for treatment of desmoid tumor. However, whether it has the therapeutic effect on abnormal bone resorption remains to be evaluated. In this study, we investigated the role of PF in the regulation of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro, and the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bone resorption in vivo. It was found that PF could suppress the formation of osteoclasts from bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) without causing cytotoxicity, inhibit bone resorption and downregulate the mRNA level of osteoclast-specific markers, including calcitonin receptor (CTR), tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), cathepsin K (CTSK), dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (Dc-stamp), Atp6v0d2 (V-ATPase d2) and nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1). Furthermore, Notch2 signaling, as well as RANKL-induced AKT signaling was significantly inhibited in BMMs. Consistent with in vitro observation, we found that PF greatly ameliorated LPS-induced bone resorption. Taken together, our study demonstrated that PF has a great potential to be used in management of osteolytic diseases."
"A 64-year-old man had an intra-abdominal mass that was detected in a follow-up examination after laparoscopic partial nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). CT showed an enhanced mass of 2.5-cm diameter near the right kidney, where partial nephrectomy had been performed. Local recurrence of RCC with duodenum invasion was suspected, and excision was performed. The final pathological diagnosis of desmoid tumor differed from the preoperative diagnosis. Therefore, we report this case as a rare example of intra-abdominal desmoid tumor mimicking local recurrence of RCC. To our knowledge, this is the first report of intra-abdominal desmoid tumor after laparoscopic partial nephrectomy."

"To explore the effectiveness of pedicled anterolateral thigh myocutaneous flap for full-thickness abdominal wall reconstruction after tumor resection. Methods: Between September 2010 and December 2017, 18 patients with abdominal wall tumors were collected. There were 11 males and 7 females, with an average age of 45.2 years (range, 29-68 years). Histologic diagnosis included desmoid tumor in 8 cases, sarcomas in 6 cases, malignant teratoma in 2 cases, and colon adenocarcinoma in 2 cases. All abdominal wall defects were full-thickness defects. Peritoneum continuity was reconstructed with mesh; the lateral vastus muscular flaps were used to fill the dead space and rebuild the abdominal wall strength; the abdominal wall soft tissue defects were repaired with pedicled anterolateral thigh flaps. The size of abdominal wall defects ranged from 15 cmx6 cm to 25 cmx22 cm; the size of lateral vastus muscular flap ranged from 10 cmx8 cm to 22 cmx10 cm; the size of anterolateral thigh flap ranged from 14.0 cmx8.0 cm to 21.0 cmx8.5 cm. The bilateral pedicled anterolateral thigh myocutaneous flaps were harvested to repair the extensive abdominal wall defects in 2 cases. All donor sites were sutured directly. Results: All wounds healed smoothly and all flaps survived totally. All donor sites healed smoothly. The mean follow-up time was 22.5 months (range, 11-56 months). No tumor recurrence occurred, the abdominal function and appearance were satisfactory, no abdominal hernia was noted. Only linear scar left at the donor sites. Conclusion: Pedicled anterolateral thigh myocutaneous flap combined with mesh is fit for large full-thickness abdominal defect reconstruction."
"Desmoid tumors are intermediary malignant, fibrous lesions occurring in various soft tissues. Surgical treatment is relentlessly challenging because of the propensity for local aggressive behavior and high risk of recurrence. Consequently, a wide range of oncological drugs and radiation therapy are being used; however, outcomes are unpredictable. We investigated whether local treatment with an oncolytic peptide could be beneficial in a patient with an unresectable desmoid tumor. CASE PRESENTATION: In a young 29-year-old Caucasian woman who was diagnosed with a retromammary desmoid tumor infiltrating deeply into the anterior thoracic wall, surgery was considered excessively mutilating, and observation was recommended. The lesion progressed, however, and caused debilitating pain, despite nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication. Subcutaneous injections of human interferon-alpha (Multiferon(R)) resulted in reduced growth kinetics but had to be terminated because of development of symptomatic pneumonitis. Frequently used oncological treatment was withheld because of the toxicity profile, and the patient was instead included in a phase I study investigating transdermal intratumoral injection of LTX-315, an oncolytic peptide that induces anticancer immune responses ( ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT01986426 ). A marked increase of CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating T cells in the lesion was complemented by upregulation of immune gene signature (including effector T-cell, T-helper type 1 cell, chemokine, and cytokine genes). These changes were followed by gradual symptom relief and long-term disease stabilization, indicating clinical benefit. LTX-315 was well tolerated until termination in week 16 after a serious allergic reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient was treated with repeated intratumoral injections of LTX-315, resulting in tumor regression accompanied by upregulation of immune genes and T-cell infiltration. Local application of immunotherapy, minimizing systemic side effects, represents a novel treatment modality in desmoid tumors that should be tested in further clinical trials."
"Desmoid tumors, which are often estrogen-dependent, frequently develop in surgical wounds. Here we report the case of 33-year-old woman with a 4-cm solid mass detected in her left adnexal area. She had previously undergone a laparoscopic surgery for endometriosis at age 29 years and had been using a combined oral contraceptive (COC) to prevent recurrence. The mass was diagnosed as a uterine myoma on the basis of ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy for 3 months resulted in shrinkage of the tumor. Using a second laparoscopy, we identified a tumor originating from the sigmoid colon. The pathological diagnosis was desmoid tumor. Gynecologists should consider the possibility of desmoid tumor in patients who have been using COCs and undergone previous surgeries."
"The ovary is an important organ of the female reproductive system, which produces oocytes and secretes reproductive hormones. Ovaries have complex dual blood supplies with their blood supply being the core component to protect and ensure ovarian function. Ovarian preservation surgery often encounters problems related to whether or not to preserve ovarian vessels on the affected side. CASE PRESENTATION: This study reports on the case of a 30-year-old female patient with the retroperitoneal fibromatosis that had a history of uterine leiomyoma. During the operation, the ovarian arteries and veins were separated according to what was found during the procedure. A postoperative examination demonstrated good function and morphology of the ovary. CONCLUSIONS: A thorough review of academic journals combined with our collection of clinical data was conducted, which confirmed the double blood supply source to the ovaries. As a result of this exploration, a new surgical method is being proposed that is designed to protect the ovaries. By conducting this new procedure, the patient's disease was not only halted and ultimately cured, but results demonstrate that the method was also able to retain the shape and function of the ovary. The postoperative satisfaction of the patient was significantly improved."
"Desmoid tumors (DTs) are rare soft tissue tumors, which frequently recur after surgery. The optimal treatment approach is still controversial due to lack of randomized data. The purpose of the study was to review a relative large series of DTs of the neck with emphasis on the value of postoperative radiotherapy (RT). METHODS: A total of 68 patients with DTs of the neck region with or without postoperative RT between 1/2008 and 12/2017 were included. They were individually matched for factors including age, gender, tumor size and margin status with a cohort of patients who underwent operative without postoperative RT. The event-free survival (EFS) was compared in the two groups. RESULTS: For the study, 34 patients and 34 matched control subjects were identified. The two groups did not differ in terms of age (p= 0.810), gender (p= 0.328), tumor size (p= 0.803) and margin status (p= 0.799). Patients who received surgery plus RT had a significantly higher 3year EFS than those who received surgery alone (74.6% vs. 13.3%, P< 0.001). Factors including postoperative RT and margin status were independent factors of EFS. The values of P were <0.001 and 0.003 and the hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) were 11.929 (4.732-30.072) and 0.299 (0.133-0.671), respectively. None of the patients treated with RT developed serious complications. CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, postoperative radiotherapy is an effective treatment in desmoid tumors of the neck. Multi-institutional and prospective studies are warranted to further validate our findings."
"JAK/STAT, Notch, PI3 kinase/AKT, mTOR, Hedgehog, and the estrogen growth regulatory pathways. Evidence for involvement of these pathways in DTF tumorigenesis is limited and predominantly based on the expression levels of key pathway genes, or on observed clinical responses after targeted treatment. No clear driver role for these pathways in DTF has been identified, and a rationale for clinical studies is often lacking. In this review, we highlight common signaling pathways active in DTF and provide an up-to-date overview of their therapeutic potential."

"Desmoid tumors (DT) are locally advanced but histologically benign monoclonal neoplasms that can occur from any musculoaponeurotic structure. The aim of this report is to analyze a rare clinical case of an aggressive intra-abdominal DT successfully treated with sorafenib. CASE SUMMARY: A 36-year-old man presented with increasing colicky abdominal pain and a self-palpable mass in his left abdomen. Fourteen years earlier he was diagnosed with a large intra-abdominal tumor, which adhered to the left colonic flexure, part of the major gastric curvature and the spleen. Subsequent exploratory laparotomy revealed a voluminous mass in the epigastrium, arising from the posterior surface of the stomach and invading the superior mesenteric vessels, transverse mesocolon and the small bowel mesentery. As the tumor was unresectable, a jejunojejunal bypass was performed. Traditional therapeutic interventions proved insufficient, and the patient was started on sorafenib with a subsequent full-disease response. CONCLUSION: DT's pathogenesis has been associated with mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene or beta-catenin gene CTNNB1, sex steroids or previous surgical trauma. Local treatment modalities, such as surgery or radiotherapy, are implemented in aggressively progressing or symptomatic patients. Sorafenib is a hopeful therapeutic option against DTs, while several pharmacological agents have been successfully used."
"Calcifying aponeurotic fibroma (CAF) is a rare, locally aggressive fibroblastic lesion that occurs predominantly in the distal extremities of children and adolescents. In the present study, a case of pathologically proven CAF arising in the sole of the right foot of a 84-year-old man is presented. Physical examination revealed a firm, immobile, non-tender mass. Plain radiographs showed a faintly calcified soft tissue mass without bone involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a well circumscribed subcutaneous mass. The patient underwent an excisional biopsy. Histologically, the tumor showed a biphasic pattern, composed of a moderately cellular fibromatosis-like component and irregular calcified areas with polygonal epithelioid cells. There has been no evidence of local recurrence six months following surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this case describes the oldest patient with this condition."
"Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors (DTs) can mimic recurrence or progression of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Differential diagnosis is important to avoid unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. CASE SUMMARY: All 8 patients experienced surgical resection of GIST, and median time to diagnosis of DT was 1.8 years after surgical resection. All sites of DT were in the peritoneum around the surgical sites of GIST. The following clinical suspicion coupled with radiological findings contributed to the suspicion of intra-abdominal DTs: (1) Occurrence of a new single lesion in the peritoneum around the surgical sites of GIST; (2) uncontrolled lesion with imatinib while other lesions being controlled with imatinib; (3) well-defined ovoid shaped lesion with delayed or mild enhancement and absence of necrosis, hemorrhage, and cystic change on computed tomography; and (4) a lesion showing mild or no hypermetabolic activity on (18)fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography, contrary to initially hyperactive lesion of GIST. All DTs were surgically removed except for one unresectable DT and only one DT recurred at another site of peritoneum, which was also surgically removed. CONCLUSION: Intra-abdominal DT should be a differential diagnosis for a new single lesion in patients with GIST."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a benign, locally invasive fibroblastic proliferation that can cause compressive effects on adjacent structures. The primary cure of this disease rests in wide excision of the tumor. Unfortunately even when surgical margins are clear of tumor, recurrence rates are high. Postoperative radiotherapy is indicated following surgical excision. We present a 13-year-old girl who had been operated for the intraspinal mass in upper thoracic spine and paraparesis with thoracic limited laminectomy and excision of the tumor mass elsewhere. The histopathological examination was reported to be aggressive fibromatosis. After 2 years, she presented again with 1-year duration of progressive deformity in the upper thoracic spine and weakness of both lower limbs. Focal kyphosis at T4-T5 was measuring 68 degrees . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed recurrent tumor involvement of posterior elements of T2-T5 and paravertebral soft tissues with signal changes in the cord at T2-T5 vertebral levels with focal kyphosis and internal gibbus. She underwent posterior spinal revision decompression with internal gibbectomy and instrumented fusion. The histopathology showed features suggestive of aggressive fibromatosis. After wound healing at 2 weeks, she underwent 3-D conformal radiotherapy, based on the preoperative tumor extent on MRI (dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks). She had normal neurology at 2-year follow-up and was tumor free on MRI. Hence, aggressive fibromatosis can recur following successful surgical wide excision. Multilevel thoracic laminectomy in growing children can cause progressive spinal deformity and neurological deficits. Operative treatment of recurrent tumor involves en bloc excision with instrumented fusion followed by local radiotherapy. This is the first pediatric recurrent spinal fibromatosis reported with successful treatment as per author's knowledge."
"Gain-of-function mutations in the beta-catenin gene ( CTNNB1 ) drive genomic instability within different cancers. However, it is unclear whether alterations in beta-catenin signaling can still lead to chromosomal rearrangements in neoplasms without metastatic potential. Here, we report a unique case, whereby a desmoid tumor of the scalp contains a missense mutation in CTNNB1 . This mutation is located at the T41 phosphorylation site-previously reported to be necessary for proper beta-catenin degradation. Online database analysis then revealed that our mutation is likely causative of many different cancers and also absent in the healthy public. Karyotyping of the desmoid tumor cells then showed complex chromosomal changes in 16 out of 20 cells examined. To treat this patient, we surgically removed both the neoplasm and underlying calvarium and then successfully reconstructed the skull and scalp. Taken together, our data suggest that increased beta-catenin signaling can lead to genomic instability in the absence of metastatic potential."
"Desmoids are locally infiltrative, nonmalignant soft tissue tumors. Surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy have been the mainstay of treatment, but relapse is common and side effects can result in significant morbidity. MR-HIFU is increasingly recognized as an alternative treatment modality. We assessed the success rate of MR-HIFU for the treatment of extra-abdominal desmoids at our institute. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five patients with relapsing desmoid tumors (three males, two females; age range 40-79 years) were treated using the Sonalleve system in an outpatient setting without general anesthesia. Changes in total tumor volumes were measured with a tumor tracking software. Adverse events were documented. RESULTS: MR-HIFU was successful in all patients without severe side effects. Follow up ranged from 13 to 60 months. Three patients required more than one treatment session. In 3 patients with small lesions (mean = 9.7 mL), complete ablation was achieved with no evidence of viable tumor on follow up MRI at an average of 35.7 months, while in two patients with larger lesions (mean = 46 mL) the targeted tumor volumes decreased by 73% at 14 months. Skin injuries comprised first- and second-degree burns and were observed with short distance to skin (mean = 0.9 cm) and proximity to bone (i.e. ribs). Skin burns healed within weeks with topical treatment. CONCLUSION: MR-HIFU shows good mid-term result for extra-abdominal desmoids with complete response for small lesions and stabilization of larger lesions. MR-HIFU for desmoids can be performed under regional anesthesia/sedation as outpatients."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is a rare benign lesion known for its local aggressiveness. The tumor management still remains under debate. Primary head and neck (HN), represents the second most prevalently affected sitein children with DF. This study aims to analyze the specificity of HN-DF in children, focusing on long-term effects of the tumor and therapies. METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study analyzed children treated for a HN-DF between 1993 and 2013. All medical files were reviewed and their outcomes analyzed according to the initial therapies provided. RESULTS: Sixteen children were selected. Mandibular and submandibular areas were the main locations (11 cases). Eight children underwent chemotherapy as first-line therapy with tumor control in 3 cases and 5 cases needing additional treatment. Six children underwent primary surgery: isolated in 3 cases and with additional treatment after tumor progression in 3 cases. A wait-and-see attitude was adopted for 2 children without any additional treatment in 1 case, and followed by additional chemotherapy in the other case. Total burden of treatment to control the disease was a biopsy (1 case), surgery (3 unique cases, 1 multiple case), surgery with chemotherapy (6 cases), and exclusive medical therapies (5 cases). Surgical postoperative sequelae were facial palsy (cases of parotid gland affection), XI(th) cranial nerve sacrifice or sensory impairment. CONCLUSION: HN-DF is a local and extensive disease that is difficult to control with surgery alone. Sequelae are frequent due to the initial tumor location or therapies. Initial conservative strategies need to be discussed in a multidisciplinary way in order to try to control the disease with the minimal morbidity."
"Desmoid tumors are known to be rare and relatively slow growing with locally invasive histology and high recurrence rates. A rare subset of these tumors occurs adjacent to the spinal column after surgery. Since 1961, only 6 cases of postoperative paraspinal desmoid tumor have been reported. This report is the first to describe the occurrence of a paraspinal desmoid tumor after surgical correction of a spinal deformity. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 56-year-old woman with multiple sclerosis reported 2-3 years of progressively worsening mid and low back pain that was worse with standing and ambulation and almost completely relieved with lying flat. Standing anteroposterior scoliosis radiographs revealed a thoracolumbar spinal deformity, which was surgically corrected with a T4 pelvis spinal fixation and fusion. At her 2-year postoperative clinic visit the patient reported good improvement in her preoperative symptoms but felt a fullness in her right upper back and neck that was nontender. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large tumor in this region. The tumor was resected en bloc, and pathology noted a 14.5 cm x 8.7 cm x 4.2 cm mass with spindle cell proliferation and positive staining for beta-catenin (mutated gene found in 85% of desmoid tumors). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a postoperative desmoid tumor after spinal deformity correction and the seventh reported case in the spine literature. All reported cases have been women aged 39-57 years. The patient will be followed closely with magnetic resonance imaging given the known high local recurrence rate of this tumor."

"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) is a lesion characterized by clonal proliferation of myofibroblasts, which exhibits an infiltrative growth pattern. It is necessary for them to be distinguished from other fibroblastic and myofibroblastic lesions as well as spindle cell tumors. Altered Wnt signaling can act as a defining characteristic of DTF, with nuclear beta-catenin serving as a diagnostic marker for. Transcription factor E3 (TFE3) has been linked to Wnt pathway activation and regulation, and may add value to the diagnosis of DTF. The present study, therefore, sought to assess whether TFE3 is a specific diagnostic marker for DTF. METHODS: Nuclear TFE3 and beta-catenin staining was performed on a wide range of tumor types such as DTF (n = 46), nodular fasciitis (n = 14), neurofibroma (n = 5), dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (n = 5), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (n = 10), sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (n = 2), synovial sarcoma (n = 5), leiomyoma (n = 3) and cutaneous scar tissue (n = 4) using an immunohistochemical approach. In addition, the clinicopathological features and localization of these tumors were summarized. FISH assay was carried out to examine Xp11.2 translocations/TFE3 gene fusions. Statistical difference between immunohistochemical expression of TFE3 and beta-catenin was analyzed. RESULTS: The expression of nuclear TFE3 protein was found in 43 (93.5%) DTF tissue samples, ranging from moderate to intense expression levels. The distribution rates of TFE3 positivity in nodular fasciitis, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, leiomyoma and scar tissue samples were 42.9, 40, 25 and 33%, respectively. All studied samples of neurofibroma, synovial sarcoma, sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans were negative for TFE3. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveal that TFE3 has a potential to serve as a diagnostic marker capable of assisting in the differential diagnosis of DTF and other spindle cell lesions."
"Desmoid tumors (DTs) are rare tumors that originate from myofibroblastic tissue. Recently, initial wait and see was recommended (ESMO guidelines Ann Oncol 2017) in the most frequent locations. This study investigates the outcome of breast desmoid tumor (BDT) according to the initial strategy. METHOD: Data from all consecutive patients treated from a BDT in four referral centers were collected. Only intra-mammary desmoid tumors were included. A pathological review and a molecular analysis (CTNNB1 gene mutation) were performed (National re-reading network of sarcomas-RRePS). Patients were grouped according to initial strategy: surgery group (SG) and active surveillance group (ASG). RESULTS: A total of 63 patients (61 women, 2 men) met the inclusion criteria. Median age was 50 years (16-86). CTNNB1 mutation was found in 61% (n = 36). SG included 46 patients (73%) (41 partial mastectomies, 2 mastectomies, and 3 mastectomies associated to parietectomies). Surgical margins were positive in 15 patients (33.3%). Median follow-up of SG was 24.9 (0.5-209) months; and 4 patients (8.7%) developed recurrence. ASG included 17 patients (27%). Their median follow-up was 42.2 (0-214) months, and 15 patients (88.2%) did not require any additional treatment. Six patients (35%) had a spontaneous regression, 9 patients (52%) were stable, and 2 patients presented a significant progression that was treated by partial mastectomy. CONCLUSION: This study supports an initial nonsurgical approach to BDTs followed by surgery based on tumor growth in select cases, which is consistent with current ESMO recommendations."
"Desmoid tumors (DTs) are rare and understudied fibroblastic lesions that are frequently recurrent and locally invasive. DT patients often experience chronic pain, organ dysfunction, decrease in quality of life, and even death. METHODS: Sorafenib has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy, which has led to the first randomized phase 3 clinical trial devoted to DTs. Concurrently, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of sorafenib efficacy in a large panel of desmoid cell strains to probe for response mechanism. RESULTS: We found distinctive groups of higher- and lower-responder cells. Clustering the lower-responder group, we observed that CTNNB1 mutation was determinant of outcome. Our results revealed that a lower dose of sorafenib was able to inhibit cell viability, migration, and invasion of wild-type and T41A-mutated DTs. Apoptosis induction was observed in those cells after treatment with sorafenib. On the other hand, the lower dose of sorafenib was not able to inhibit cell viability, migration, or invasion or to induce apoptosis in the S45F-mutated DTs. The investigation of autophagy showed the dependency of S45F-mutated DTs on this pathway as a part of cell survival mechanism. Significantly, when autophagy was inhibited genetically or pharmacologically in the S45F mutant cell strains, sensitivity to sorafenib was restored. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the response to sorafenib differs when comparing S45F-mutated DTs and T41A-mutated or wild-type DTs. Furthermore, the combination of hydroxychloroquine and sorafenib enhances the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in S45F-mutated DT cells, suggesting that profiling beta-catenin status could guide clinical management of desmoid patients who are considering sorafenib treatment."

"To investigate the clinicopathological features, diagnosis and differential diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS) with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT)-like features. Methods: Five cases of DDLPS with IMT-like features were collected from the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the First People's Hospital of Qinzhou between 2013 and 2018. EnVision method and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to detect the immunophenotype of the tumor cells and the profile of MDM2 gene amplification respectively. Results: All five cases were male and the median age was 61 (range 53 to 65) years. The clinical symptoms were mainly related to the space-occupying lesions. The tumors were located in duodenal mesentery (two cases), intestinal wall (one case), retroperitoneum (one case), and spermatic cord (one case). Grossly, the tumors were not well encapsulated, ranging from 3 to 13 cm (median 6.7 cm) in diameter, with tan to gray and firm cut surface. Histologically, the dedifferentiated component closely resembled inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), with spindle/polygonal/stellate-shaped cells arranged in storiform, sheet-like, or random pattern, with varying degrees of chronic inflammation and fibrosis. All three major patterns seen in IMT (myxoid, cellular and hypocellular fibrous) were observed, the hypocellular fibrous pattern was the most common. Well-differentiated liposarcomatous component was found in the peripheral areas of all the tumors. One case had high grade dedifferentiated component. Four cases were strongly positive for MDM2 and p16. Two cases were positive for SMA, and one case was focally positive for desmin and one for CD34. None of the cases stained for ALK-1. FISH demonstrated MDM2 gene amplification in all five cases. Clinical follow-ups were available in all five cases and the interval ranged from 3 to 66 months (median 23 months). Two patients developed recurrences and one patient had metastasis. The remaining two patients were alive with no evidence of tumor recurrence at 3 and 14 months after surgery respectively. Conclusions: DDLPS with IMT-like features is a more aggressive neoplasm than its histological mimic (IMT), and should not be misdiagnosed as other intermediate or low-grade malignant tumors, such as IMT, sclerosing liposarcoma, inflammatory liposarcoma, aggressive fibromatosis, solitary fibrous tumors, low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma, and low-grade fibrosarcoma."
"To identify prognostic factors influencing progression-free survival (PFS) of aggressive fibromatosis (AF) after postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) and assess correlations between immunohistochemistry (IHC) features of beta-catenin/smooth muscle actin (SMA) and PFS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records of 37 patients with AF treated by PORT from 1984 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Fifteen patients underwent wide excision for AF and 22 patients received debulking operation. The median total dose of PORT was 59.4 Gy. IHC staining results of beta-catenin and SMA were available for 11 and 12 patients, respectively. RESULTS: The median follow-up duration was 105.9 months. Five-year PFS rate was 70.9%. Tumor size or margin status was not related to PFS in univariate analysis (p = 0.197 and p = 0.716, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that increased interval from surgery to PORT (>5.7 weeks) was a marginal risk factor for PFS (p = 0.054). Administration of PORT at the initial diagnosis resulted in significantly improved PFS compared to deferring PORT after recurrence (p = 0.045). Patient with both risk factors of deferring PORT after recurrence and interval from surgery to PORT >5.7 weeks had significantly lower 5-year PFS than patients without risk factor (34.1% vs. 100.0%; p = 0.012). Nuclear beta-catenin intensity tended to inversely correlate with 5-year PFS, although it did not reach statistical significance (62.5% at low vs. 100.0% at high; p = 0.260). SMA intensity was not related to PFS (p = 0.700). CONCLUSION: PORT should be performed immediately after surgery irrespective of margin status or tumor size especially in recurrent case. Nuclear beta-catenin staining intensity of IHC might correlate with local recurrence."
"Fibromatosis is a histologically benign growth of fibroblastic and myofibroblastic cells, with a potential to recur and invade local organs. It can occur as a superficial or deep form. Visceral fibromatosis and superficial fibromatosis are histologically similar. They both have alterations in the WNT signalling pathway, but mutations in the APC or beta-catenin gene do not occur in superficial fibromatoses. Aim: To present four cases of deep fibromatosis and one case of Peyronie's disease, along with immunohistochemical staining analysis and the criteria for differential diagnosis. Material and methods: All patients were hospitalised in the Central Clinical Hospital of the MSWiA in Warsaw during the period of 2012-2015. Surgical specimens were examined, and tissue samples were embedded in paraffin blocks. Results: As the result of the study we present a short algorithm of immunostainings that can be useful in differential diagnosis. When a spindle cell tumour is encountered in the abdomen a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) should always be excluded; therefore, a CD117 staining is recommended as the first step. When the staining is negative, fibromatosis can be taken into consideration. beta-Catenin staining should be done in order to confirm that diagnosis. Conclusions: The diagnosis of fibromatosis is not always simple; GISTs can easily be mistaken for it. Immunohistochemical staining with CD34 and CD117 antibodies are useful in differential diagnosis. DTF should present negative stainings for S100, CD34, CD99, and bcl-2, which can help to distinguish it from other mesenchymal tumours."
"Intra-abdominal fibromatosis is an unusual mesenchymal tumour that can be locally aggressive without any metastatic potential. Fibromatosis may simulate cancer recurrence on imaging surveillance for colorectal cancer follow-up. The optimal treatment of recurrent peritoneal malignancy is cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Confirmatory biopsy of lesions suspicious for colorectal cancer recurrence may not be feasible, thereby rendering surgery the safest option. Our aim was to determine the incidence of fibromatosis in a cohort of patients undergoing CRS and HIPEC for suspected colorectal cancer recurrence. METHODS: One hundred and seventy-one CRS and HIPEC cases were performed at our Peritoneal Malignancy Institute between February 2007 and October 2018 for colorectal peritoneal metastases and were included in a prospectively maintained database. RESULTS: A total of 49 (29%) of 171 cases were performed for primary colorectal cancer with peritoneal metastases, whereas 122 (71%) of 171 cases were performed for suspected colorectal cancer recurrence detected on surveillance imaging after primary colorectal cancer resection. On histological analysis of the resected specimen, five (4.1%) of 122 cases undergoing CRS and HIPEC for colorectal recurrence had fibromatosis. CONCLUSION: Fibromatosis can masquerade as colorectal cancer recurrence. In this series it occurred with an incidence of 4.1% among a cohort of patients undergoing CRS and HIPEC for probable recurrence. Surgical resection may be the only option to confirm the diagnosis and rule out malignancy."
"Desmoid tumors are benign, locally aggressive soft tissue tumors derived from fibroblasts. Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a safe and effective treatment for desmoid tumors. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively review the MRgFUS treatments of desmoid tumors at our institution to determine which technical treatment parameters contributed most significantly to the accumulation of thermal dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study protocol was approved by the local IRB. We retrospectively reviewed data from MRgFUS treatments performed in histologically-confirmed desmoid tumors, over a period of 18 months. Sonication parameter means were compared with ANOVA. Mixed effects and linear regression models were used to evaluate the relative contribution of different parameters to thermal dose volume. RESULTS: Nine-hundred thirty-six sonications were reviewed in 13 treatments. Accumulated dose per sonication was greatest for elongated sonications (0.96 cc +/- 0.90) compared to short (0.88 +/- 0.93 cc) and nominal (0.55 +/- 0.70 cc) sonications, p < .001. 65.2% of short sonications resulted in high percentage ablations, compared to 46.0% of nominal and 35.1% of elongated sonications. Standardized beta coefficients (anticipated increased volume in cc per unit) for power, duration, energy and average temperature were 0.006, 0.057, 0.00035 and 0.03, p < .001. Regarding dose efficacy, dose area contributed the greatest to this variability - 50.7% (45.5-54.8%), followed by distance - 16.6% (12.9-20.0%). CONCLUSIONS: A variety of sonication parameters significantly contributed to thermal ablation volume following MRgFUS of desmoid tumors, in reproducible patterns. This work can serve as the basis for future models working toward improved planning for MRgFUS treatments."
"A Desmoid tumor in the neck is a rare tumor in an even more unusual site. Our patient was an 18-year-old primigravid Bedouin woman from northwest Egypt. She presented with a dormant neck nodule that grew explosively during her first pregnancy and stopped abruptly after delivery. The presentation was confusing at first, as the fixation of the tumor to the underlying tissues implied a malignancy, while a 1-year history of non-metastasis alluded to a benign process. Pre-operative tissue diagnosis revealed an Estrogen receptor-expressing desmoid tumor. Desmoid tumors are indeed locally invasive with no metastatic potential, but they tend to recur and grow during high-estrogen states. This report aims to increase awareness of peripartum Desmoid tumors, as well as discuss the surgical-site, psychological and socioeconomic challenges in the peculiar case of this Bedouin woman, and our recommendations after this experience and literature review."

"This study aimed to assess the feasibility of split course radiotherapy (SCRT) and reports long-term outcomes in patients with desmoid tumors (DT). Patients and methods: Between 2001 and 2004, 31 patients with recurrent (n=19) or primary large desmoid fibromatosis (>/=10 cm) (n=12) who were treated with SCRT were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were treated with two phases of radiotherapy with a median interval time of 99 days (range: 81-122 days) and a median total dose of 6,399 cGy (range: 5,013-7,039 cGy). The median dose for the first phase was 3,969 cGy/22 Fx (range: 2,999-4,305 cGy), and 2,495 cGy/14 Fx (range: 1,982-3,039 cGy) for the second phase. Progression-free survival (PFS) in response to radiotherapy was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. The prognostic factors associated with survival were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: The median age of all patients was 30 years (range, 7-58 years). With a median follow-up of 60.4 months (range, 2-187 months), eight patients experienced disease progression after treatment. The PFS rate at 3 and 5 years for the whole population was 90% and 71.3%, respectively. PFS for patients with split course of <100 days or >/=100 days interval was 100% vs 78.6% at 3 years, and 80.4% vs 62.9% at 5 years, respectively (P=0.189). In multivariate analysis, the radiotherapy (RT) interval time was an independent prognostic factor for PFS (>/=100 days vs <100 days, HR 11.544, 95% CI 1.034-128.878, P=0.047). PFS was not significantly influenced by age, gender, surgery, tumor location, RT technology, or RT dose. Radiation-related acute complications occurred in nine (29%) patients after RT, and RT-related long-term complications occurred in three (9.7%) patients. Conclusion: SCRT with an appropriate treatment interval (<100 days) is well tolerated by DT patients with favorable long-term outcomes."
"Desmoid tumours of the head and neck, also known as fibromatosis, are rare, locally invasive benign tumours with high recurrence rate, causing considerable morbidity. Complete surgical excision of desmoid tumours is considered to be the only effective treatment. CASE REPORT: We present a case of fibromatosis of the right posterolateral region of the neck in a 56-year-old woman who presented with right neck mass. The patient underwent complete excision of the tumour with no adjuvant therapy. No recurrence or neurological deficit was observed 2 years after surgery. CONCLUSION: Although desmoid tumour is a benign neoplasm with no metastatic potential, treatment is challenging due to its aggressive, infiltrative behaviour with a tendency to recur."
"Fibromatoses are a group of benign connective tissue tumors characterized by the infiltrative, aggressive proliferation of well-differentiated fibroblasts, leading to frequent local recurrence. Within this heterogeneous disease group, superficial fibromatoses show slower growth and more benign infiltration of surrounding tissues than deep fibromatoses. Superficial fibromatoses relevant to dermatology include palmar, plantar, and penile fibromatosis, knuckle pads, pachydermodactyly and infantile digital fibromatosis. They present clinically with subcutaneous nodules or cords that lead to local infiltration and limited mobility of the affected areas. Treatment options vary from watchful waiting, non-invasive methods such as radiotherapy and intralesional corticosteroid/collagenase injections to radical surgical procedures. Early intervention may disrupt disease progression and may even restore functional ability. These disorders should therefore be recognized and treated early in the course of the disease."

"Collagenous fibroma arising from the subacromial region is extremely rare. It is important to distinguish collagenous fibroma from other fibrous tumors including desmoid tumors, to differentiate between the prognoses and management strategies, including surgical treatment. The present case report describes the case of a 42-year-old man with a collagenous fibroma of the subacromial region. He received a follow-up examination following treatment for osteosarcoma. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans used to assess for metastatic lesions indicated uptake in his left shoulder. The maximum standardized uptake value was 2.4. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated iso-intensity to muscle on T1-weighted images and iso-intensity with slightly high intensity on T2-weighted images. Post-contrast fat-suppressed magnetic resonance images indicated slightly heterogeneous enhancement of the lesion. There were no notable results from X-rays, bone scintigraphy and thallium-201 scintigraphy. Histological examination revealed collagenous fibroma. To the best of our knowledge, the present case is only the second incidence of collagenous fibroma arising from the subacromial region, and the first description of thallium-201 scintigraphy and PET scans in collagenous fibroma. The multimodal radiological data of this case may be useful for assisting in the differentiation of fibrous tumor types, including collagenous fibroma."
"Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors are rare and generally occur in some patients with familial adenomatous polyposis or secondary to an external stimulus such as surgical trauma. We report herein a case of intra-abdominal desmoid tumor in the jejunal mesentery after laparoscopic colectomy for sigmoid colon cancer. CASE PRESENTATION: A 74-year-old woman underwent laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy for colon cancer with pathological stage I. Follow-up computed tomography (CT) 18 months after primary surgery showed a nodular and enhanced soft tissue density mass, 20 mm in size, in the mesentery at the left side of the abdomen. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels were within the normal range. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography did not suggest cancer recurrence. Another CT scan, done 1 month later, revealed that the tumor had enlarged to 25 mm in size. Although the pathological diagnosis was not obtained, we suspected recurrence of the sigmoid colon cancer and applied chemotherapy using capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab. After 3 cycles of chemotherapy, however, the tumor had enlarged further. Therefore, the surgical resection of the tumor was performed to determine the diagnosis and to achieve possible curative resection of the tumor. The tumor existed in the mesentery of the jejunum, 100 cm from the ligament of Treitz, and showed invasive growth. We resected 40 cm of the jejunal segment together with the tumor. Microscopically, the tumor was composed of fibroblast, myofibroblast, and infiltrating the inflammatory cell and diagnosed as desmoid tumor by immunostaining (desmin+/-, beta-catenin+, CD117-, vimentin+). At 33 months after the resection of the desmoid tumor, neither the sigmoid colon cancer nor desmoid tumor has had a recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: After surgery for gastrointestinal cancer, it is difficult to differentiate between intra-abdominal desmoid tumor and recurrence. The possibility of intra-abdominal desmoid should be considered along with tumor recurrence during postoperative surveillance after resection of gastrointestinal cancer, especially when the risk of recurrence is low."

"Desmoid tumors are histologically benign but locally invasive tumors that rarely can occur in the head and neck. In this article, we illustrate a rare case of desmoid tumor formation in intracranial posterior fossa after suboccipital craniotomy for hemangioblastoma. A 43-year-old woman presented with headaches, dizziness, equilibrium disorders, nausea, and vomiting due to a hemangioblastoma in posterior fossa. A gross total resection was achieved. Three years postoperatively, the patient developed a growing mass at the intracranial intradural regions in posterior fossa near the previous incision. Surgical resection of the lesion was performed and the mass was totally resected. Postoperative imaging demonstrated no residual evidence of tumor and the pathological review of the surgical tumor specimen demonstrated desmoid tumor in intracranial posterior fossa. As desmoid tumors seem to arise at the location of a previous surgical site, they should be considered in the differential diagnosis for superficial masses occurring in the surgical bed after posterior surgery. Additionally, identifying the relationship between the basic effects of tumor surgery and desmoid tumor formation is considerably needed."
"Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) utilizes high-intensity focused ultrasound to noninvasively, thermally ablate lesions within the body while sparing the intervening tissues. Magnetic resonance imaging provides treatment planning and guidance, and real-time magnetic resonance thermometry provides continuous monitoring during therapy. Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound is ideally suited for the treatment of extra-abdominal desmoid fibromatosis due to its noninvasiveness, lack of ionizing radiation, low morbidity, and good safety profile. Conventional treatments for these benign tumors, including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, can carry significant morbidity. Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound provides a safe and effective alternative treatment in this often-young and otherwise healthy patient population. While there is considerable experience with MRgFUS for treatment of uterine fibroids, painful bone lesions, and essential tremor, there are few reports in the literature of its use for treatment of benign or malignant soft tissue tumors. This article reviews the principles and biologic effects of high-intensity focused ultrasound, provides an overview of the MRgFUS treatment system and use of magnetic resonance thermometry, discusses the use of MRgFUS for the treatment of extra-abdominal desmoid tumors, and provides several case examples."
"We present an unusual case of a 6-year-old boy who presented with the sudden presence of left neck mass and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, whose subsequent imaging demonstrated a previously undiagnosed anterior mediastinal mass (AMM) extending into the left neck. Biopsy of the mass was consistent with a desmoid tumor, which is a rare cause of AMM in children. Desmoid tumors are locally aggressive, often invading and enveloping surrounding tissues, but overall slow growing. The sudden growth of the neck mass suggests a very aggressive desmoid tumor, causing an unexpected respiratory compromise. Anterior mediastinal masses may cause symptoms by compressing the heart, great vessels, and airways. However, the patient may adapt and develop compensatory mechanisms to counter the compressive effects. Emergency care of the patient with an AMM who presents with acute respiratory distress includes optimizing oxygenation through promoting a calm environment, oxygenating while minimizing positive end-expiratory pressure, maintaining the patient's compensatory mechanisms by minimizing sedation and muscle relaxation, positioning the patient to minimize compressive effects of the mass on the vital thorax structures, and early consultation with pediatric specialists to develop a shared-emergency treatment strategy and to secure an expedited disposition to the appropriate venue of care."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is a rare monoclonal fibroblastic proliferation that is characterized by locally infiltrative but rarely metastatic lesions. Tyrosine kinase and gamma-secretase inhibitors are primarily used in the targeted therapy of DF. The use of these drugs, however, is mainly based on the recommendations of retrospective studies with small sample sizes. Previous studies that focused on the mechanism, efficacy, and safety of targeted therapy for DF were reviewed to provide references for clinical applications and research. The efficacy and safety of targeted therapy were compared with those of other systemic therapy options. Targeted therapy does not provide considerable advantages in efficacy and safety over other medical treatments and is usually applied after the failure of antihormonal therapies, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and chemotherapy. Further studies are required to explore the mechanism, indications, and appropriate drug dosage of the targeted therapy of DF."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) is a rare benign proliferation of myofibroblasts with an unpredictable disease course. Treatment of intra-abdominal located DTF is difficult because of the close relationship with vital organs. Case presentation: A healthy young male presents with an asymptomatic palpable mass in the lower right abdominal quadrant. A computed tomography shows a 10 x 7 cm(2) pear-shaped mass, and pathological examination revealed DTF. A watchful waiting approach was initiated, as the patient was asymptomatic and surgery would imply a significant amount of intestinal resection. After a follow-up of 2 years, the tumor has regressed spontaneously and the patient is still without symptoms. Conclusions: DTF is a difficult to treat condition where individualized management is appropriate. An asymptomatic patient could be treated with a watchful waiting approach, even with intra-abdominal location. Thereby sparing unnecessary morbidity as the tumor can be stable for many years or even regress spontaneously."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a rare soft tissue tumor and the chest wall is one of the common sites of its extra-abdominal occurrence. A bifid rib is one of the congenital rib abnormalities. We report a case of desmoid-type fibromatosis arising in a chest wall's bifid rib. A 42-year-old female complained of right chest pain without remarkable medical, traumatic, or familial history. Chest-computed tomography revealed a chest wall tumor located adjacent to a bifid costal cartilage of third rib. We performed chest wall resection of second and third ribs. Pathologically, the tumor was diagnosed a desmoid-type fibromatosis of the chest wall. We surmise mechanical stimulation due to the bifid rib may be related to the occurrence of the tumor. In case of desmoid-type fibromatosis without somatic gene mutation, traumatic history, wound, implants, or use of female hormonal agents, we should search also local congenital abnormality."
"Rupture of a superior mesenteric artery pseudoaneurysm is a rare but potentially lethal complication in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and desmoid disease. OBJECTIVE: We report our experience in the management of such patients with a rare but significant and life-threatening condition. DESIGN: This is a descriptive study of a small series of patients. SETTINGS: Data were obtained from their medical charts and from the Cologene Database of the David G. Jagelman Polyposis Registry in the Sanford R. Weiss, M.D., Center for Hereditary Colorectal Cancer at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. PATIENTS: Of 227 patients with mesenteric desmoid disease, there were 4 cases of superior mesenteric artery pseudoaneurysm rupture. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: We reviewed the patients with mesenteric desmoid tumors in our desmoid registry. The registry is approved by the institutional review board of the Cleveland Clinic. RESULTS: The patients were young (aged from 22 to 28 y at presentation), with otherwise minimal comorbidities. Two patients had a previous proctocolectomy and J-pouch, and 2 had a total colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis. Two patients had preemptive endoluminal stenting and fared better than the 2 who had damage control embolization. One patient died and, in the others, recovery was prolonged and complicated. Two of the 4 patients have ended up with a reasonable quality of life. LIMITATIONS: We acknowledge that this is a rare complication of an uncommon disease and, as such, any case series will be limited by small numbers; therefore, a tailored approach is warranted when managing such complex patients. CONCLUSIONS: We advocate an increased awareness of the possibility of visceral pseudoaneurysms in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis who have desmoid disease encasing the superior mesenteric artery. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A914."
"Desmoid tumors develop from connective tissue, fasciae, and aponeuroses, and may occur in the context of familial adenomatous polyposis or may arise sporadically; also, they may be extra-abdominal, intra-abdominal, or located in the abdominal wall. These benign tumors have a great aggressiveness with a high rate of local recurrence. Familial adenomatous polyposis is an inherited condition with autosomal dominant transmission, and is characterized by the development of multiple colonic and rectal adenomatous polyps, as well as desmoid tumors. We present the case of a 54-year-old woman with germline APC gene mutation, who underwent a total colectomy, subsequently developing two large infiltrative solid intra-abdominal lesions consistent with desmoid tumors. Medical treatment with Cox-2 inhibitors was initiated without result. She was submitted to resection for intestinal obstruction, but developed local recurrence. The lesions were also unresponsive to tamoxifen, and chemotherapy was initiated with dacarbazine plus doxorubicin, switching to vinorelbine plus methotrexate, achieving a good response in all lesions after 12 months. The approach to these intra-abdominal lesions should be progressive, beginning with observation, then a medical approach with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or with an anti-hormonal agent. Afterwards, if progression is still evident, chemotherapy should be started. Surgery should be reserved for resistance to medical treatment, in palliative situations, or for extra-abdominal or abdominal wall desmoids tumors."
"Plantar fibromatosis (Ledderhose disease) is a rare, benign, hyperproliferative fibrous tissue disorder resulting in the formation of nodules along the plantar fascia. This condition can be locally aggressive, and often results in pain, functional disability, and decreased quality of life. Diagnosis is primarily clinical, but MRI and ultrasound are useful confirmatory adjuncts. Given the benign nature of this condition, treatment has historically involved symptomatic management. A multitude of conservative treatment strategies supported by varying levels of evidence have been described mostly in small-scale trials. These therapies include steroid injections, verapamil, radiation therapy, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, tamoxifen, and collagenase. When conservative measures fail, surgical removal of fibromas and adjacent plantar fascia is often done, although recurrence is common. This review aims to provide a broad overview of the clinical features of this disease as well as the current treatment strategies being employed in the management of this condition."
"A 52-year-old man underwent laparoscopic total gastrectomy for gastric cancer. After 2 years, a follow-up computed tomography(CT)scan showed a large, solid 10 cm-sized mass in his left upper abdomen. Under the diagnosis of a suspected mesenchymal tumor, a tumor resection with a partial resection of the upper jejunum and transverse colon was performed. Case 2: A 61-year-old man underwent laparoscopic pylorus-preserving gastrectomy for gastric cancer. After 1.5 years, follow-up CT showed a tumor of 2 cm in diameter near the greater curvature side of the upper stomach. Under the diagnosis of a suspected gastrointestinal stromal tumor(GIST), a laparoscopic partial resection of the stomach was performed. Histologically, spindle-shaped cells without atypia and rich collagen fibers were observed, and the sample was positive for b-catenin by immunostaining in both cases; from this evidence, the patients were diagnosed with desmoid tumors. Desmoid tumors have invasive proliferation characteristics, and treatment requires consideration of the balance between securing a surgical margin and increasing surgical stress."
Desmoid tumors are very rare soft tissue neoplasia that are slow growing and locally aggressive. They grow anywhere in the body and are rarely develop in the breast . Histopathologic examination confirms diagnosis. Recurrence rate is very high even after complete resection. We report the management of a rare case of rapidly growing breast desmoid with intra-thoracic involvement causing cardiac compression.
"Estrogen receptor signaling and cyclin D1 have a major role in tumor cell proliferation in breast cancer. Desmoid tumors are rare neoplasms that may respond to endocrine treatment. The present study aimed to investigate the expression levels and the clinical relevance of estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) and cyclin D1 in desmoid tumors. METHODS: This study consists of 83 patients with a surgically treated desmoid tumor. ERbeta and cyclin D1 expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays. Cyclin A and Ki67 were studied in our previous work. RESULTS: Median ERbeta expression was 10.8%. ERbeta expression correlated with expression of the proliferation antigens Ki67 (rp = 0.35, P = 0.003), cyclin D1 (rp = 0.34, P = 0.004), and cyclin A (rp = 0.34, P = 0.004). ERbeta immunoexpression showed a trend towards predictive impact for recurrence as a continuous variable. Further explorative analysis indicated that very high ERbeta expression was related to high risk of relapse (hazard ratio [HR] 2.6; P = 0.02). Median cyclin D1 expression was 15.6%. High cyclin D1 expression was associated with high Ki67 and cyclin A expression. Cyclin D1 was not associated with time to recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: ERbeta and cyclin D1 immunopositivity correlated with high proliferation in desmoid tumors. High ERbeta expression might be predictive for postoperative recurrence."
"one located in the pineal gland and other in the suprasellar region, both with characteristics suggestive of germinoma. Chromosomal microarray analysis was performed due to the association of obesity with social disability, and the result identified a 604 kb 16p11.2 microdeletion. The surgical biopsy confirmed the histological diagnosis of a germinoma. Pharmacological treatment with testosterone, hydrocortisone and desmopressin was started, and the patient underwent radiotherapy (40 Gy divided in 25 fractions). Three months after radiotherapy, a significant decrease in suprasellar and pineal lesions without improvement in pituitary hormonal deficiencies was observed. The patient is currently under follow-up. To the best of our knowledge, we describe the first germinoma in a patient with a 16p11.2 deletion syndrome, raising the question about the impact of this genetic alteration on tumorigenesis and highlighting the need of molecular analysis of germ cell tumors as only little is known about their genetic background. Learning points: Central nervous system germ cell tumors (CNSGTs) are rare intracranial tumors that affect mainly young male patients. They are typically located in the pineal and suprasellar regions and patients frequently present with symptoms of hypopituitarism. The molecular pathology of CNSGTs is unknown, but it has been associated with gain of function of the KIT gene, isochromosome 12p amplification and a low DNA methylation. Germinoma is a radiosensitive tumor whose diagnosis depends on imaging, tumor marker detection, surgical biopsy and cerebrospinal fluid cytology. 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome is phenotypically characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. Seminoma, cholesteatoma, desmoid tumor, leiomyoma and Wilms tumor have been described in a few patients with 16p11.2 deletion. Bifocal germinoma was identified in this patient with a 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome, which represents a putative new association not previously reported in the literature."
"Desmoids are rare soft-tissue tumors of the abdominal wall that may sporadically occur extra-abdominally. It manifests as clonal fibroblastic proliferation with an infiltrative tendency and capacity to recur without metastasizing. An adolescent male presented with a gradually increasing globular, non-tender, firm, non-pulsatile swelling (8 x 5 x 3 cm(3)) in the left popliteal fossa that had been present for five months. Following thorough investigation with imaging and Tru-cut biopsy, finally, an excisional biopsy was done. Histopathological examination confirmed a desmoid tumor, and the patient received adjuvant radiotherapy. At the one-year postoperative follow-up, there was no recurrence; the patient had been explained the prognosis. This case highlights a rare site of an extra-abdominal desmoid but with classical clinical presentation, imaging, intraoperative, and histopathological findings. Awareness and knowledge of this entity are of paramount importance for clinical practitioners."
"Infantile fibrosarcoma (IFS) is a rare soft-tissue sarcoma, which classically presents as an aggressive and rapidly enlarging tumor over the distal extremities of children in their first year of life. The presence of ETV6 and NTRK3 gene rearrangement is characteristic of IFS, which can be detected on routine fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing. Patients with IFS typically respond well to surgical resection and chemotherapy and have an overall survival of approximately 90%. In this report, we outline the use of integrative clinical sequencing (ICS) including RNA-seq in a patient with refractory, metastatic IFS to reveal an unusual fusion (LMNA-NTRK1), not detected by routine FISH testing, which was treated with oral crizotinib and resulted in a complete and durable long-term response. This study highlights the utility of ICS in identifying cryptic gene fusions, especially in refractory malignancies, and demonstrates how such information can be used to select targeted therapies in patients with actionable molecular alterations."

"Gardner syndrome describes a variant phenotype of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), primarily characterized by extracolonic lesions including osteomas, dental abnormalities, epidermal cysts, and soft tissue tumors. We describe a 2-yr-old boy presenting with a 2-cm soft tissue mass of the forehead. Pathologic evaluation revealed a nuchal-type/Gardner-associated fibroma. Sequencing of the APC gene revealed a pathologic variant c.4666dupA. Parental sequencing of both blood and buccal tissue supported the de novo occurrence of this pathologic variant. Further imaging revealed a number of additional lesions including a large lumbar paraspinal desmoid, a 1-cm palpable lesion posterior to the left knee, firm lesions on bilateral heels, and multiple subdermal lesions. Colonoscopy was negative. This case illustrates a genetic variant of Gardner syndrome resulting in an aggressive early childhood phenotype and highlights the need for an individualized approach to treatment."
"The emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has improved survival for patients with metastatic melanoma. The types of disease-response patterns to ICI therapy can be more complex relative to traditional chemotherapy and include mixed responses, pseudoprogression, and oligoprogression. The potential benefit of surgery after incomplete response to ICI therapy has not been explored. The purpose of this study was to explore outcomes of surgery after ICI therapy in patients with metastatic melanoma. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted at two centers and included patients with melanoma who underwent surgery after treatment with monotherapy or combination therapy with anti-programmed cell death protein (PD) 1 and/or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein (CTLA)-4 checkpoint blockade. RESULTS: Of 25 patients, nine received anti-CTLA-4 therapy, eight received anti-PD-1 therapy, and eight received both anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 therapies before surgery. Five patients were treated in the adjuvant setting and developed new lesions, whereas 20 patients were treated for metastatic disease and underwent surgery for persistent disease on imaging after ICI therapy. Twenty-five patients underwent 30 operations without complications. Twenty-seven of 30 masses were confirmed to be melanoma on pathology, one was a desmoid tumor and two were necrosis. At a median follow-up of 14.2 months, 2 patients died, 8 were alive with a known disease, and 15 continued to have no further evidence of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery was well tolerated in this cohort of patients receiving ICI therapy for melanoma. Surgery may benefit select patients with an oligoprogressive disease after ICI therapy. After a mixed response, surgery remains the only definitive method to render some patients free of disease."
"Here, we report the case of a 66-year-old male patient who previously underwent resection of sigmoid colon cancer and its liver metastasis. His follow-up contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed a mass shadow at around the gastrosplenic ligament, which gradually increased in size. Because it could not be pathologically diagnosed by transgastric EUS-FNA, en bloc resection wasperformed surgically for the tumor in the greater omentum. Hematoxylin-eosin staining of the resected specimen showed fibroblast-like cellswith hyperplasia of bold collagen fibersand spindle-shaped nucleus. While the immunostaining findings denied a diagnosis of mesenchymal neoplasm such as GIST, leiomyosarcoma, or schwannoma, it was pathologically diagnosed as a desmoid tumor. He has been followed up without any recurrence for 2-and-a-half years after the surgical resection. Desmoid tumors tend to be locally invasive; thus, there is the potential for local recurrence, although the frequency of distant metastasis is very low. In cases in which the tumor increases in size, en bloc resection with sufficient surgical margin should be performed. Cases of desmoid tumors originating from the greater omentum are reportedly rare; however, en bloc resection may be useful for both diagnosis and treatment of tumors of the greater omentum showing increased size that are also surgically resectable."
"83.6-100%). Therefore, en bloc resection of the tumor and involved adjacent organs is a safe and effective treatment modality for IA/RPDF."
"A recent clinical trial shows that sorafenib is effective against desmoid tumors. The study found that 33% of tumors shrank in patients who received the drug. The estimated 1-year progression-free survival for the sorafenib-treated patients was 89%, and the 2-year rate was 81%."

"Nodular fasciitis is a benign reactive lesion, often mistaken for a soft-tissue sarcoma in clinical practice. Involvement of the finger is rare, and a finger joint even rarer. We report on the clinical, radiological and histological features of intra-articular nodular fasciitis in a 52-year-old man, originating from the proximal interphalangeal joint of the right ring finger, with cortical erosion of adjacent bone. The discussion is focused on the tumor diagnosis and therapeutic approach, the differential diagnosis and the importance of immunohistochemical staining to establish the final diagnosis."
"Cryotherapy, also called Cryoablation (CA), is a technique that provides a local treatment to various pathological conditions. In Musculoskeletal tumours management, Cryoablation is well accepted and validated as a treatment in palliative cures for metastatic patients. Recently, CA has been proposed also as an alternative to radiofrequency ablation in osteoid osteoma and other benign tumour treatment with promising results. Cryotherapy with argon ice-balls as local adjuvant in open surgery is a tool that can provide enlargement of surgical margins if used properly. There is still not enough evidence supporting use of cryotherapy as local adjuvant in Musculoskeletal open surgery as the series cited above are very small and there is no comparative RCT between local adjuvant therapies including CA. One-hundred-and-eighty-three patients were treated with Cryoablation from 2000 and 2018 in the Musculoskeletal Tumours Surgery Unit of Careggi (Florence) and the University 2nd Clinic of Pisa. In our study group, 38 patients (26.6%) were affected by bone metastasis, 16 patients (11.1%) by aneurismal bone cysts or angiomas, 22 patients (15.4%) by low-grade malignant musculoskeletal tumours, 2 patients (1,4%) by fibromatosis, 63 patients (44.1%) by benign musculoskeletal tumours (principally Giant Cell Tumours-GCT) and 2 patients (1.4%) by Osteosarcomas. In 125 cases (87.4%), CA has been used as an adjuvant therapy, in 12 cases (8.4%) as a percutaneous ablation therapy and in 6 cases (4.2%) as adjuvant to remove tumoral lesions 'en bloc' or as a 'poor technique' for its sterilizing effect on previously resected bones. Mean follow-up was 10 years. Twenty-three patients (16%) were classified as Alive with Disease (AWD) due to local recurrence or tumour progression (14 metastases, 5 low-grade malignant bone tumours, 4 Giant Cell Tumours). Eight patients died due to the disease (6 metastases, 2 osteosarcomas), while 1 died from leukaemia. One-hundred-and-eleven patients (78%) were classified as Continues Disease Free (CDF). All patients reported decrease in pain-related symptoms after surgery and all surgeons reported better control of blood loss. Three cases (2%) of local skin necrosis or wound dehiscence were reported. No local recurrences were reported after fibromatosis ablation. Our results confirm that CA could be considered as a safe and effective technique to treat various conditions as adjuvant and palliative therapy. In particular, in open surgery, cryotherapy as an adjuvant treatment could lead to very low rates of recurrence in locally aggressive tumours like Giant Cell Tumours. These results could be generalized but a better understanding about indications and outcomes can be reached studying CA in specific populations with comparation to other adjuvant techniques."
"Dumbbell-shaped tumor is a type of the inner and outer cervical spinal canal tumor, and most of them are neurogenic tumors. Desmoid tumor is a rare tumor, and no case of them involving intervertebral foramen formed dumbbell-shaped in cervical spine have been reported before in English literature. Here we report a case of desmoid tumor arising in the cervical spine which is presented as typical dumbbell-shaped tumor. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 47-year-old female was admitted to our department with a mass in her left neck. The tumor was initially thought to be a neurogenic cervical dumbbell tumor based on physical and radiological examination. Postoperative HE and immunohistochemical staining verified the diagnosis of a cervical dumbbell desmoid tumor, which had never been reported before. We report our experience and reviewed literature about desmoid tumor to share our experience and explore proper treatment option of such lesion. CONCLUSION: Desmoid tumors in the head and neck may present as cervical dumbbell-shaped tumors. Before the treatment plan was undertaken, thorough examinations including surgical pathology were necessary."
"A 31-year-old woman developed worsening pain and paresthesia in the neck, shoulder, and arm over a period of 6 years. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a soft-tissue mass in the subscapular region, with likely involvement of the scapula and the subscapularis muscle. The mass was resected, and the final histologic diagnosis was desmoid-type fibromatosis. CONCLUSION: Desmoid tumors with subscapularis muscle involvement are exceedingly rare. Although limited range of motion is the more common presentation for these tumors, this case demonstrates that desmoid tumors may present with primarily neurologic symptoms."
"We present a case of a desmoid tumor recurrence in a patient with a history of a resected desmoid tumor of the right neck area with free surgical margins six months earlier. The neoplasm was found to invade the parapharyngeal space, and wide excision was performed including most of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM), the thrombosed internal jugular vein (IJV), and the infiltrated spinal accessory nerve (SAN). The histopathologic findings displayed free microscopic margins, with close margins at the site of the parapharyngeal space extension. After 3 months, there was no sign of tumor recurrence. After 6 months, local tumor recurrence was identified on clinical examination and imaging. The decision of the Oncology Board was further treatment with radiotherapy (RT). Response to treatment was satisfactory, and the patient was on close follow-up for twelve months. Desmoid tumors are very rare benign neoplasms of mesenchymal origin with negligible mortality but high morbidity, due to their high recurrence rates, local tissue infiltration, and unpredictable disease course and response to treatment. No universally acceptable treatment protocols have been introduced to date. Appropriate patient counseling and close follow-up are warranted in all cases."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis can arise in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), therefore patients with desmoids often undergo colonoscopy to rule out FAP. Because finding FAP is uncommon, we sought to define subsets of desmoid patients in whom colonoscopy frequently identified FAP. METHODS: Patients with desmoid-type fibromatosis were identified from surgery and pathology databases at a single institution, and information on colonoscopy and FAP diagnosis was collected retrospectively. CTNNB1 mutation status was defined by Sanger sequencing and digital polymerase chain reaction of archived specimens. RESULTS: Among 626 patients with desmoids, 26 were diagnosed with FAP. In 20 patients, FAP diagnosis predated the desmoid diagnosis. Among patients without prior FAP diagnosis, 161 underwent colonoscopy, which identified only six cases of FAP (diagnostic yield 3.7%). Yields were substantially higher among patients with four characteristics: age < 40 years (11% yield), intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal tumors (5.4%), multifocal disease (29%), and family history (8%) (all p < 0.001). All cases of FAP were detected in patients younger than 40 years of age and with at least one of the other three characteristics. CTNNB1 mutation status was available in 82 patients with known FAP status. None of the 61 patients with CTNNB1 mutations were diagnosed with FAP, while 7 of the 21 patients with no CTNNB1 mutation detected (24%) were FAP patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with desmoid-type fibromatosis and undiagnosed FAP generally have multiple risk factors, which may be used to selectively recommend colonoscopic screening. Routine CTNNB1 sequencing may also rule out FAP and allow for deferral of colonoscopy."
"Mesenteric fibromatosis (MF) is a rare tumor whose biological behavior is intermediate between benign fibrous neoplasms and fibrosarcomas, and the characteristic of these tumors are local aggressive lesions which is prone to local recurrence but non-metastasizing. The common symptom is abdominal distention or painless mass. We report a case of giant MF in abdominal cavity with abdominal distention as the main symptom. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 26-year-old male presented with 2-month history of abdominal distention, lack of appetite, and symptoms grew progressively more debilitating with time. DIAGNOSES: This patient underwent a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan which showed a giant (37 x 25 x 13 cm), inhomogeneous enhancing, well-defined, and soft tissue density mass in abdominal cavity, possibly arising in mesocolon, which suggested a high possibility of MF. The postoperative pathology showed that the tumor cells to be positive for beta-catenin, vimentin, negative for CD34, CD117, DOG-1, S-100, Desmin, which confirmed the diagnosis of MF. INTERVENTIONS: Exploratory laparotomy was performed, which revealed a large mass involving the transverse colon wall, the root of mesocolon, and encasing the middle colic vessels and the 1st branch of jejunal arteries. The complete surgical resection was performed and the mass weighted 10 kilograms (kg). OUTCOMES: The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged 9 days after surgery. Three-month, 6-month, 12-month and 18-month on follow-up after surgery, showed no evidence of recurrence. LESSONS: The MF is a very rare tumor, especially a giant tumor (10 kg) involving the muscular layer of colon wall. In addition, treatment of giant MF still remains a challenge. We consider that surgical resection with negative margins is the goal but not at the expense of damaging the function of vital organs. Specific measures should be considered based on the individual patient in order to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life."
"We report a case of a 2-year-old female who presented with bilateral progressive proptosis, visual loss, nasal obstruction, and breathing difficulty. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large sino-orbital mass that was extending to the orbital apex and skull base. An initial diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma was made elsewhere on the basis of the presence of round and spindle cell tumor. Subsequent biopsy with immunohistochemical staining was positive for nuclear staining with beta-catenin, shifting the diagnosis to a myofibroblastic tumor, favoring desmoid-type fibromatosis. With image guidance, near complete excision of tumor was performed by a multidisciplinary team, while respecting danger zones such as the skull base and the optic nerve. Following a recurrence over 2 months, additional excision was performed with a 6-month treatment of methotrexate and vinblastine. Desmoid tumor is a rare form of soft tissue tumor uncommonly seen in the orbital area. Although benign, it is known to be recurrent and infiltrative. Few data are known and further information will aid in the management of these tumors."

"Desmoid tumors (also referred to as aggressive fibromatosis) are connective tissue neoplasms that can arise in any anatomical location and infiltrate the mesentery, neurovascular structures, and visceral organs. There is no standard of care. METHODS: In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 87 patients with progressive, symptomatic, or recurrent desmoid tumors to receive either sorafenib (400-mg tablet once daily) or matching placebo. Crossover to the sorafenib group was permitted for patients in the placebo group who had disease progression. The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival; rates of objective response and adverse events were also evaluated. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 27.2 months, the 2-year progression-free survival rate was 81% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69 to 96) in the sorafenib group and 36% (95% CI, 22 to 57) in the placebo group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.31; P<0.001). Before crossover, the objective response rate was 33% (95% CI, 20 to 48) in the sorafenib group and 20% (95% CI, 8 to 38) in the placebo group. The median time to an objective response among patients who had a response was 9.6 months (interquartile range, 6.6 to 16.7) in the sorafenib group and 13.3 months (interquartile range, 11.2 to 31.1) in the placebo group. The objective responses are ongoing. Among patients who received sorafenib, the most frequently reported adverse events were grade 1 or 2 events of rash (73%), fatigue (67%), hypertension (55%), and diarrhea (51%). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with progressive, refractory, or symptomatic desmoid tumors, sorafenib significantly prolonged progression-free survival and induced durable responses.

"Pediatric desmoid tumor (PDT) is rare and has a high local recurrence rate. The purpose of the present study was to analyze clinical risk factors of local recurrence in PDT patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed clinical data of 66 PDT patients from 2004 to 2015. All patients underwent macroscopically complete resection, and some recurrent tumors were prescribed radiotherapy. Factors such as sex, age at presentation, location, and proximity to nerves or vasculature were analyzed. The local recurrence rate and recurrence-free survival were analyzed with these factors. RESULTS: All patients in the present study were children and had extra-abdominal tumors. The median follow-up time was 6.6 years. Thirty-six (55%) patients had local recurrence. Age, sex, tumor site, tumor size, and proximity to nerves/vasculature had a significant impact on prognosis in univariate analysis. Radiotherapy decreased the local recurrence rate. In multivariate analysis, younger age, tumor location in buttocks, larger tumor, and proximity to important nerves/vasculature were independent risk factors for poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Favorable therapeutic strategies could be selected according to the preoperative prognostic risk factors. Radiotherapy should be considered for local recurrence of PDT."
"Desmoid fibromatosis is a rare, neoplastic tumor known for its aggressive local invasion and recurrence after surgery. Tumors can occur sporadically or associated with familial adenomatous polyposis. We present 3 cases of desmoid fibromatosis postpancreatectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. All cases occurred within 3 years of diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, with subsequent extensive diagnostic work-up to rule out metastatic disease. No relationship between pancreatic cancer and desmoid fibromatosis is documented in the literature, with a postulated connection via mutations on the Wnt/APC/Beta-catenin pathway."
"Keloids, dermal fibroproliferative lesions, often occur secondary to skin injury and extend beyond the margins of the original lesion. Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) is a rare condition arising from fibroblasts and is characterized clinically as a nonmetastasizing but locally invasive tumor. In this work, we present the case of a patient who developed AF in the chest 3 years after surgery and postoperative radiotherapy for keloids. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 15-year-old female patient who underwent surgery and postoperative radiotherapy for keloids presented with AF in the chest 3 years after intervention. DIAGNOSES AND OUTCOMES: Physical examination revealed a fan-shaped scar on the manubrium sterni with a radius of 7 cm, as well as a 9 (L) x 2-cm (W) longitudinal reddish and irregularly surfaced scar arising from previous incisions. By comparing this case with similar cases reported previously, we infer that a history of exposure to radiation is the main factor that contributes to the development of AF in patients suffering from keloid scars. We also discussed the clinical characteristics of AF and treatment options and suggest factors that should be considered when using radiotherapy in patients with keloids. LESSONS: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of AF developing in a patient after radiotherapy for keloids. Radiotherapy may be a causal factor of AF."
"To update our experience with long-term outcomes in patients with desmoid fibromatosis treated with radiation therapy (RT) and to characterize factors associated with increased risk of local recurrence. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We reviewed the records of 209 consecutive patients with desmoid fibromatosis treated with RT, either alone or as combined-modality therapy (CMT) with surgery, at our institution from 1965 to 2015. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 98 months (range, 1-509 months). The 5- and 10-year local control (LC) was 71% and 69%, respectively. Fifty-nine patients (28%) experienced a local recurrence at a median time of 23 months (interquartile range, 15-38 months). Among all patients, on multivariable analysis, adjusting for anatomic site, size, age, treatment era (>2005 vs </=2005), treatment approach (RT alone vs CMT), and an interaction between age and treatment, we found only age </=30 years (hazard ratio [HR], 2.94; P = .005; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-6.27) and large tumor size >10 cm (HR, 2.51; P = .03; 95% CI, 1.09-5.78) to be correlated with poorer LC. Notably, for patients receiving RT alone, the 5-year LC was 43% for patients </=30 years old versus 75% for >30 years old (P < .001). On multivariable analyses, for patients receiving RT alone, the only factor associated with inferior LC was age </=30 years (HR, 2.87; P = .001; 95% CI, 1.51-5.47). The same was true for patients treated with CMT; age </=30 years was the only factor associated with inferior LC (HR, 5.36; P = .01; 95% CI, 1.40-20.58). CONCLUSIONS: Among all patients with desmoid fibromatosis, RT is an effective local therapy for tumor control. However, young patients </= 30 years have notably high rates of local recurrence regardless of treatment strategy, which requires further study. Treatment decisions should be risk-adapted by large referral centers with multidisciplinary expertise in desmoid management."
"Extra-abdominal fibromatosis (EAF) is a rare, locally aggressive tumor that originates in fascial structures. It accounts for less than 0.3% of all tumors diagnosed. Head and neck tumors account for only 7% of those, and only a few cases occurring in the parotid gland have been previously reported. We describe the case of a 34-year-old woman who presented with a painful parotid mass. She was found to have an EAF of her right parotid gland. Medical management with antibiotics and immunosuppression therapy was unsuccessful. Surgical resection was required for both a definitive diagnosis and management. Preoperative findings on computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and both fine-needle aspiration biopsy and surgical biopsy were nonspecific, as is typical in EAF cases."

"Synovial sarcomas are relatively common intermediate-to-high-grade malignant soft tissue tumors, often with an initial indolent course. And among the sarcomas primary intra-abdominal synovial sarcoma is a relatively rare entity that may present with an abdominal mass and diagnosis is usually confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The authors report a case of a 46-year-old man who presented with a large palpable abdominal mass. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed a large well-defined heterogeneous intra-abdominal mass filling the entire pelvis and extending upwards till the subhepatic region causing displacement of intra-abdominal organs. However, no other focal lesions were seen in the solid organs. The same findings were confirmed on surgery. Histopathology was suggestive of desmoid tumor/hemangiopericytoma. Immunohistochemistry showed positive markers corresponding to synovial sarcoma. The patient was advised to undergo chemotherapy which was refused and follow-up was lost. After 10 months, patient presented for follow-up CT, which showed marked increase in size of the lesion."
"Ledderhose disease or plantar fibromatosis is a rare hyperproliferative disorder of the plantar aponeurosis, clinically characterized by nodules situated especially on the medial border of the foot. It is histopathologically associated with Dupuytren's disease. This disease has some risk factors, like old age, alcohol or nicotine abuse, liver dysfunction, trauma or exposure to vibrations and autoimmune disorders, but the exact etiology is still unknown. Even though it is benign, the local manifestations can be aggressive, leading to debilitating deformities and contractures of the toes. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging are used to confirm the diagnosis and to eliminate other disorders. Whenever is possible, the conservative therapies are recommended. Having a high recurrence, Ledderhose disease can be hard to treat, needing multiple surgical interventions. This paper aims to cover all the important aspects of this disease for daily medical practice, from history to clinical manifestations, diagnostic methods and histopathological features, to conservative and surgical treatment modalities."
"Sporadic desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) is a rare soft tissue tumor of mesenchymal origin. It is characterized by local invasive growth and unpredictable growth behavior. Three distinct mutations involving the CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) gene have been identified in the vast majority of DTF tumors, which cause activation of the Wnt signaling pathway and impact prognosis. This study examines whether the different CTNNB1 mutants (T41A, S45F) occurring in DTF tumors differentially affect Wnt signaling activity, which might explain the different disease course between DTF patients harboring different CTNNB1 mutations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 61 formalin fixed paraffin embedded DTF samples with known CTNNB1 status was used to measure the relative mRNA expression level of Wnt target genes AXIN2, DKK1 and CCND1. Additionally, publicly available mRNA expression data retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus of 128 DTF samples were used for an unsupervised cluster analyses based on the expression of a selection of Wnt targets. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in relative expression levels of Wnt target genes AXIN2, DKK1 and CCND1 was identified between either CTNNB1 wild-type, S45F or T41A mutated DTF samples. Moreover, the hierarchical cluster analyses using selected Wnt targets did not discriminate between different CTNNB1 mutation types. CONCLUSIONS: No differences in the expression levels of Wnt target genes were observed between the different CTNNB1 mutation types in DTF tumors. Further studies are needed to decipher the mechanism accounting for the diverse disease courses between DTF patients with different CTNNB1 variants."

"Intra-abdominal aggressive fibromatosis is a locally aggressive tumor mostly originating from the mesentery or retroperitoneal space, infiltrating adjacent tissues, and very rarely metastasizing to distant organs. There are only two case reports in the English language literature where intra-abdominal aggressive fibromatosis originated from the intestinal wall. In this study, we aimed to report a case of aggressive fibromatosis originating from the muscularis propria layer of the duodenum and invading pancreas. Another interesting aspect of this case is that a primary paraduodenal hydatid cyst was incidentally detected in the surgical specimen. A 46-year-old female patient presented to our clinic with postprandial nausea and vomiting. A contrast-enhanced abdominal computerized tomography revealed a mass lesion with a size of 100 mm x 80 mm which originated from the distal pancreas and compressed the gastric pilor externally. Upon exploration the distal part of duodenum, proximal jejunum, and pancreatic mass were noted to form a conglomerated structure. Therefore, the fourth part of the duodenum, a 25 cm part of the proximal jejunum, distal pancreas, and the spleen were excised en-bloc. The pathology report of the specimen indicated fibromatosis with a diameter of 55 mm that originated from the muscularis propria of the duodenum and extended into the pancreatic parenchyma. There was also an incidentally detected 10 mm paraduodenal hydatid cyst. No tumor recurrence was detected at a follow-up period of 24 mo. In conclusion, the most ideal treatment of desmoid-type fibromatosis is surgical resection of the mass lesion with clean surgical borders. Although rare, this tumor may originate from the intestinal wall. Histopathological verification is of great significance for a proper diagnosis."
"Desmoid tumors (DTs) of the head and neck have typically been classified as extra-abdominal, although the anatomic challenges of the head and neck warrant consideration of these DTs as a special entity. We present a review of DTs and describe our series of five patients with DTs of the head and neck treated within 2 decades. Altogether, 53 patients with DTs treated surgically at a tertiary care center over a 20-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Outcomes of the treatment of DTs of the head and neck (n = 5) were analyzed as a case series. DTs are rare, histologically benign, but locally aggressive tumors. In our series of 5 patients with head and neck DTs, no patient experienced a recurrence during a median follow-up of 47.5 months (range 13 to 150), although all had positive histologic margins. The functional integrity of vital structures over meticulous radicality of the tumor resection must be considered, especially in the head and neck."

"Breast and chest wall desmoid tumours can cause debilitating symptoms and deformity. The mutilating effects of surgical treatment have prompted a shift to medical treatments and even to a wait-and-see approach. This study sought to highlight specific characteristics of breast and chest wall desmoid tumours on long-term follow-up by sequential MRI scans. METHODS: Thirty-two breast MRI scans from six patients with chest wall or breast desmoid tumours followed up for up to 6 years were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: All patients underwent breast surgery prior to the development of the desmoid tumour. Five of the patients had reconstruction or augmentation using silicone implants. Two desmoids were treated primarily with surgery, three with medical means and one is under wait-and-see approach. On MRI, tumours appeared either oval and lobulated (chest wall) or spiculated with architectural distortion (breast). Chest wall desmoids demonstrated both an enhancing high-T2-signal component and a non-enhancing low-T2- signal component. The histologically defined phases during the course of desmoid tumours (progression, regression, residual disease) could be demonstrated by corresponding MRI changes in each of the components. CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance imaging delineates the complex infiltrative features of chest wall and breast desmoid tumours. In tumours with a bright cellular enhancing and dark collagenous non-enhancing component, treatment response may be predicted by changes on serial T2-weighted sequences, beyond the tumour-dimension-based RECIST assessment alone."
"Desmoid tumors can be safely managed with watchful waiting, including either observation alone or tamoxifen/NSAIDs. Surgery at first presentation can be associated with significant treatment burden. BACKGROUND: Immediate surgery was historically recommended for desmoid tumors. Recently, watchful waiting, (tamoxifen/NSAIDs or observation alone), has been advocated. METHODS: All diagnoses of desmoid tumor within the Alberta Cancer Registry from August 2004 to September 2015 were identified. Patients with FAP were excluded. Demographics, tumor characteristics and treatment and outcome data were collected. Outcomes were compared between immediate surgery and watchful waiting. The effect of abdominal wall site on progression and recurrence and the effect of microscopic margin on recurrence were assessed with Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: We identified 111 non-FAP patients. Median follow-up was 35 months from diagnosis. 74% were female. Mean age was 42. Fifty (45%) underwent watchful waiting, of whom 21(42%) progressed, with median PFS of 10 months. Fifty-three (48%) underwent resection at presentation, of whom 8 (15%) recurred, with median disease-free survival of 22 months. Abdominal wall lesions were equally represented in both groups, and equally likely to progress on watchful waiting (50% vs 39%, p=0.53), but there was a trend toward decreased recurrence after surgery. (5% vs 23%, p=0.08). Microscopic margin had no effect on recurrence (14% of margin negative vs 20% of margin positive, p=1.0). CONCLUSIONS: Watchful waiting was successful in 58% of patients, and a further 28% only required one aggressive treatment thereafter, for a total of 86%. Surgery had a favorable recurrence rate (15%), but some recurrences were associated with significant treatment burden. Treatment should be tailored to individual patients in a multidisciplinary setting. A trial of observation appears warranted in most patients. Recurrence rate was not affected by positive margins."
"Fibromatosis or desmoid tumor in the breast is a very rare benign soft tissue tumor. We report a case of recurrent desmoid tumor arising from latissimus dorsi flap after lumpectomy for breast carcinoma. To our knowledge, this is the first case of desmoid tumor arising from the latissimus dorsi flap. Despite its benignity, desmoid tumor is often locally aggressive, therefore timely diagnosis and proper management are very important. Imaging and pathological diagnosis as well as treatment management are discussed. High clinical suspicion and multidisciplinary approach are essential for prompt diagnosis and management. Wide surgical resection is required, but there is no consensus regarding treatment due to limited data."
"The aim of this study was to identify predictors of desmoid progression during observation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Untreated desmoids can grow, remain stable, or regress, but reliable predictors of behavior have not been identified. METHODS: Primary or recurrent desmoid patients were identified retrospectively from an institutional database. In those managed with active observation who underwent serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) with T2-weighted sequences, baseline tumor size was recorded, and 2 radiologists independently estimated the percentage of tumor volume showing hyperintense T2 signal at baseline. Associations of clinical or radiographic characteristics with progression-free survival (PFS; by RECIST) were evaluated by Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier statistics. RESULTS: Among 160 patients with desmoids, 72 were managed with observation, and 37 of these had serial MRI available for review. Among these 37 patients, median age was 35 years and median tumor size was 4.7 cm; all tumors were extra-abdominal (41% in abdominal wall). Although PFS was not associated with size, site, or age, it was strongly associated with hyperintense T2 signal in >/=90% versus <90% of baseline tumor volume (as defined by the ""test"" radiologist; hazard ratio = 11.3, P = 0.003). For patients in the >/=90% group (n = 20), 1-year PFS was 55%, compared with 94% in the <90% group (n = 17). The percentage of baseline tumor volume with hyperintense T2 signal defined by a validation radiologist correlated with results of the test radiologist (rho = 0.75). CONCLUSION: The percent tumor volume characterized by hyperintense T2 signal is associated with desmoid progression during observation and may help distinguish patients who would benefit from early intervention from those who may be reliably observed."
"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a totally noninvasive procedure that has shown promising results in the management of numerous malignant and nonmalignant conditions. Under magnetic resonance or ultrasound guidance, high-intensity ultrasound waves are focused on a small, well-defined target region, inducing biologic tissue heating and coagulative necrosis, thus resulting in a precise and localized ablation. This treatment has shown both great safety and efficacy profiles, and may offer a multimodal approach to different diseases, providing pain palliation, potential local tumor control, and, in some cases, remineralization of trabecular bone. In musculoskeletal field, HIFU received FDA approval for treating bone metastasis, but its application has also been extended to other conditions, such as osteoid osteoma, desmoid tumor, low-flow vascular malformation, and facet joint osteoarthritis. This article illustrates the basic principles of HIFU and its main effects on biologic tissues with particular attention on bone, provides a step-by-step description of the HIFU procedure, and discusses the commonly treated conditions, in particular bone metastases."
"Desmoid fibromatosis is a rare benign neoplasm arising from musculoaponeurotic structures with the potential to infiltrate local tissues and recur locally. While the commonly affected regions are the shoulder, chest wall and back, thigh, head and neck, localization in the foot is rare and only a few cases have been reported. Deep-seated lesions of foot tend to spread along the fascia and nerve or tendon sheaths. PATIENT CONCERNS: We present a case of a 41-year-old female with a 3 years history of a slowly enlarging painful mass in the right foot. DIAGNOSES: Desmoid fibromatosis was diagnosed based on clinical manifestations, imaging findings and pathological examinations. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated by local incomplete resection. OUTCOMES: The patient recovered well postoperatively and was well followed up at our outpatient department with no evidence of recurrence during 16 months of follow-up after local excision. LESSONS: Surgical excision is recommended for symptomatic lesions located in the foot. However, it is difficult to excise thoroughly and periodic follow-up is needed to monitor for recurrence. Further study is warranted to determine whether patients benefit more from function preservation instead of complete resection."
"Accurate diagnosis of sarcomas relies on the integration of clinical, histopathological and molecular features. Our understanding of the latter has increased dramatically in recent years with the application of high-throughput sequencing. Concomitantly, the role of immunohistochemistry has expanded as genomic alterations have been exploited by the development of diagnostic markers that serve as surrogates for their detection. Herein, we review selected immunohistochemical markers that can infer the presence of diverse molecular events. These include gene fusions in vascular neoplasms (FOSB, CAMTA1 and TFE3), round cell sarcomas (BCOR, DUX4 and WT1), and fibroblastic/myofibroblastic tumors (STAT6, ALK and Pan-TRK); amplifications in well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas (MDM2 and CDK4); and deletions in several aggressive neoplasms (SMARCB1 and SMARCA4). Protein correlates of single nucleotide variants (beta-catenin in desmoid fibromatosis) and epigenetic alterations (histone H3K27me3 in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor) and markers discovered through gene expression profiling (NKX2.2 and MUC4) are also discussed."
"Intermediate tumors of the head and neck fall in the borderline category. They are clinically aggressive tumors with no malignant phenotyping. They are locally infiltrative and have high recurrence rate with less chances to metastasize. The standard care is surgical excision with wide margins. However, surgeons are challenged with the anatomic complexity of the head and neck, increasing the susceptibly of satellite cells being left behind. Ki-67 and MMP-9 are proliferative index and extracellular matrix degradation biomarkers, respectively. They are directly correlated to malignant tumors, whereas less associated with the benign ones. Our main objective was to correlate between Ki-67 and MMP-9 expressions and the recurrence rates in these borderline tumors. We performed a retrospective immunohistochemical study comparing the immunoexpression of Ki-67 and MMP-9. Tumors of interest were aggressive fibromatosis (AF, n=70), epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE, n=25), hemangiopericytoma (HP, n=25), benign fibrous histiocytoma (BFH, n=80) and juvenile ossifying fibroma (JOF, n= 40). Our results revealed that AF followed by HP showed significant high levels of MMP-9 expression, with an average positive area percentage of 40% and 37.4% respectively, compared with other tumors (P<0.05). Ki-67 immunoreaction was significantly the lowest in AF (2.3%, P<0.05) and the highest in JOF (24.7%). To conclude, MMP-9 can be used as a possible target in these tumors as an adjuvant therapy to minimize recurrence rates."
"Extra-abdominal desmoid tumors (DTs) are rare tumors of apparent fibroblastic origin with unpredictable clinical behavior. Though histologically benign and slow growing, DTs can be proliferative, aggressive tumors, invading the surrounding areas. DTs located extra-abdominally are most commonly found in the extremities or proximal structures like the shoulders, chest wall, and neck. Spinal involvement is very rare. Here, we describe a case where an extra-abdominal DT mimicked a schwannoma in the posterior cervical spine. A 67-year-old female patient presented with acute neck and bilateral shoulder pain. After attempting conservative treatments with no symptomatic relief, a magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine was obtained, showing a paraspinal mass in the posterior elements from C2 to C4. The computed tomography guided needle biopsy showed rare spindle cells, suggestive of a spindle cell neoplasm, and complete surgical resection was performed. The pathology report was consistent with fibromatosis, leading to a final diagnosis of the extra-abdominal desmoid. This case demonstrates a rare presentation of an unusual tumor that often manifests with nonspecific symptoms or no symptoms at all."
"Aggressive fibromatosis or Desmoid fibromatosis is a benign tumor which originated form mesenchymal tissues of the body. This tumor has strong potential of recurrence and infiltration but it does not metastasize to other organs of the body. This case series is focused to determine the treatment outcomes for pediatric patients of aggressive fibromatosis. METHODOLOGY: It is a retrospective case series conducted on 7 patients presented to section of Orthopedics, department of surgery of our institute in Karachi. We included all the cases of pediatric patients from 1 to 16 years, with biopsy proven fibromatosis from January 2000 to December 2015. PRESENTATION OF CASES: Out of 7 pediatric patients, there were 6 (85.7%) males and 1 (14.3%) female patient. The median age was 6 years IQR (5-11) years. Gluteal region was the most common site of disease. Four patients (57.1%) had positive tumor margins while three (42.9%) had negative margins. Out of 7 patients, 4 patients (57.1%) had recurrent disease and they had positive margins. The median Disease Free survival time was 14 months and there was no expiry of patients. CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATION: The conclusion of our study was that aggressive fibromatosis is more prevalent in children below 15 years of age and disease burden is higher in male gender. Positive margins after surgery indicate a high risk for disease recurrence therefore; primary surgery with negative margins is the treatment of choice for children with AF. However, we recommend that multicenter trials should be conducted in the future to clarify the role of adjuvant treatment for patients with pediatric AF."

"Nagoya University, National Cancer Center Hospital, Niigata University, Okayama University, Kyushu University, and Cancer Institute Hospital. For all cases, immunohistochemical staining of beta-catenin and gene mutation analysis of CTNNB1 were performed. Of 104 cases, 87 (84%) showed nuclear staining of beta-catenin, and 95 (91%) showed positive staining in the cytoplasm. The proportion of cases showing strong nuclear staining of beta-catenin was significantly higher in the cases with S45F than in those with T41A or wild type. The proportion of cases stained strongly in the cytoplasm rather than in the nucleus was significantly higher in the group of T41A than that of S45F or wild type. Among 17 cases in which nuclear immunostaining was absent, CTNNB1 mutation was observed in 5 cases (29.4%). There were unignorable cases of DF with negative beta-catenin immunostaining despite a definitive clinical and pathological diagnosis of DF and/or positive CTNNB1 mutation."
"Gardner's syndrome (GS) is a rare syndrome with autosomal dominant inheritance, which is characterized by multiple intestinal polyps, dental anomalies, desmoid tumors, and soft tissue tumors. All gastrointestinal symptoms seen in GS are associated with the underlying familial adenomatosis polyposis and abdominal desmoid tumors, with the most common symptoms being anemia, lower gastrointestinal bleeding, abdominal pain, diarrhea, obstruction, and mucous defecation. To our best knowledge, no case of GS that has presented with gastrointestinal perforation and bleeding has ever been reported in the English language medical literature. A 37-year-old male who had been diagnosed with GS five years earlier was referred to our clinic for lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Despite the absence of a bleeding focus on conventional angiography, the patient was operated on with laparotomy, due to the persistence of both signs and symptoms of mild peritonitis. On the laparotomy, the patient was noted to have areas of perforation in the duodenum, splenic flexura, and mid-rectum. The third and fourth part of the duodenum, the proximal 15 cm segment of the jejunum, a 10 cm segment of the terminal ileum, the whole colon, and the upper and middle rectum were resected, and duodeno-jejunal side-to-side anastomosis and terminal ileostomy were performed. The histopathological analysis of the large mass measuring 30 cm x 20 cm was reported as a desmoid tumor. The pathological examination of the tumor foci detected in the colonic specimen revealed poorly differentiated adenosquamous carcinoma."
"Liposarcoma is divided into myxoid, pleomorphic, well-differentiated, and dedifferentiated subtypes. Dedifferentiated liposarcoma displays the greatest histomorphologic diversity, including a subset with myofibroblastic differentiation that shares similarities with a spectrum of reactive, benign, and malignant soft tissue lesions. Misdiagnosis may lead to deleterious consequences, as dedifferentiated liposarcoma differs significantly in its prognosis and treatment from its mimics. OBJECTIVE.-: To review the clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular features of the myofibroblastic variant of dedifferentiated liposarcoma as well as the key distinguishing features from its mimics. DATA SOURCES.-: Review of pertinent literature on major features and current understanding of dedifferentiated liposarcoma with myofibroblastic differentiation. CONCLUSIONS.-: The myofibroblastic variant of dedifferentiated liposarcoma is an uncommon and underrecognized sarcoma with several important differential diagnoses, and likely represents the major subset of aggressive retroperitoneal tumors that may have been misdiagnosed as desmoid-type fibromatosis, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, or another type of sarcoma in the past."
"Extra-abdominal desmoid tumors, also known as aggressive or deep fibromatosis, are uncommon soft tissue tumors that rarely involve the breast. Although the exact etiology is unknown, the development of these tumors has been correlated with sites of previous trauma, surgery or in association with familial adenomatous polyposis. Clinically, breast fibromatosis is often mistaken for carcinoma but lacks metastatic potential. It is locally aggressive with high rates of recurrence. The treatment is primarily wide local excision with negative margins. Adjuvant treatments have been suggested and include radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormonal therapy, however, there are no evidence-based treatment protocols to support their use. Here, we describe a case of fibromatosis that developed within the capsule around a silicone breast implant treated with surgical excision alone. The patient remains recurrence free at 3 months post-operative magnetic resonance imaging."
"The treatment paradigm in desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) has changed in recent years from a surgery-based strategy to a multidisciplinary approach that includes systemic therapies. Among various medical therapies, hydroxyurea has been considered of potential interest. This case series summarizes the experience gained at four centers using hydroxyurea in relapsing DF. METHODS: Eligibility requirements were age < 21 years, histologically confirmed DF, and progressive or recurrent disease after at least one line of systemic therapy. Hydroxyurea was given orally at an initial dose of 20 mg/kg/day (escalated up to 30 mg/kg/day as necessary, if well tolerated). RESULTS: The series included 16 patients treated between 2008 and 2016. Hydroxyurea was the second systemic therapy in nine cases, and the third (at least) in seven. There was no reported G3-G4 hematological toxicity, and one case of G3 diarrhea. Dose reductions were reported in three cases (due to G2 neutropenia). The response rate was 18.7% major partial remissions, 37.5% considering any amount of shrinkage, 68.7% considering symptom response or signs of tissue response as well. In patients with no progression, the treatment was continued for 9-24 months. CONCLUSION: This is the first published series on the efficacy of hydroxyurea in pediatric DF. The response rate was moderate, but similar to that reported for other medical therapies currently considered as treatment options in this disease. Though further, larger series are needed to confirm as much, hydroxyurea has potential as an effective alternative therapy for DF."
"Desmoid tumors (DT) are rare neoplasms with unknown etiology arising from musculoaponeurotic structures. Chest wall localization is uncommon and has been associated with high recurrence rate unless radical resection with negative margins is carried out. Postresectional reconstruction can be challenging in presence of giant lesions and might require adoption of complex reconstruction methods including use of well vascularized muscle flaps. We present a case of giant hump-like recurrent chest wall DT, which was radically resected following placement of multiple subcutaneous silicon tissue expanders, to gain redundant skin, which eventually allowed in conjunction with two transposition, cutaneous-adipose flaps, harvested from the upper gluteal region, an optimal reconstruction of the large postresectional defect."
"Desmoid tumors are rare, monoclonal myofibroblastic neoplasms that occur in the extremities, the trunk, and the abdominal cavity. We present a case that is significant for its rarity and for consideration of its treatment plan. A 17-year-old male reported swelling of his abdomen and abdominal pain. He was referred to our hospital with no history of surgery, trauma, or familial adenomatous polyposis. A large tumor in the abdominal cavity was detected by computed tomography, and surgical resection was performed. The tumor was thought to have developed from the anterior lobe of the transverse colon mesentery. It weighed 5.9 kg. Tumor cells with collagen fibers were observed in histopathological examination, but heteromorphism and the nuclear fission image were not apparent. Immunostaining revealed beta-catenin expression in the tumor cell nucleus. Diagnosis was an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor. Currently, there are no signs of recurrence. In this case, preoperative diagnosis was difficult, but surgery was the optimal treatment according to the symptoms. Desmoid tumors have invasive development and common local recurrence, so sufficient range of resection including normal tissue and strict follow-up are necessary."

"A 39-year-old female patient was referred to our tertiary oncologic center for additional investigations relating to a suspect pancreatic tail lesion. An abdominal computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging scan showed a solid lesion demonstrating progressive enhancement. Complete resection was obtained and the final diagnosis was that of a desmoid tumor of the pancreas, an exceptionally rare tumor demonstrating overlap with other solid and cystic lesions of the pancreas [1]. Therefore, it is important to recognize the essential role of pathology, particularly immunohistochemistry, in identifying this tumor. The high rate of postsurgical recurrence should prompt repeated follow-ups considering the potential aggressive nature of desmoid tumors."
"Retroperitoneal desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is an uncommon mesenchymal neoplasm presenting as a firm mass with locally aggressive features. It usually manifests as a well-circumscribed or ill-defined, solid mass on cross-sectional imaging. Cystic changes of DF have been described in the literature in association with prolonged medical treatment or abscess formation. However, spontaneous cystic change is rarely reported. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report the case of a 46-year-old patient with a DF mimicked a large cystic tumor in the retroperitoneum. Ultrasonography and computed tomography were performed in order to search for localizations and characteristics of the cystic tumor. Radiological findings showed an oval cystic mass with a relatively thick wall, measuring 18.3 x 12.3 x 21.5 cm in the left upper abdomen. Laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy was performed and histopathological examination by immunohistochemical study enabled us to diagnose a DF invading the pancreatic parenchyma. The patient remained asymptomatic during an 8-month follow up period. CONCLUSIONS: We report an extremely rare case of retroperitoneal DF with spontaneous cystic change. DF can manifest as a mainly cystic mass with a thick wall, as in our case, which makes the correct diagnosis difficult. DF should be included in the preoperative differential diagnosis of a cystic retroperitoneal mass, regardless of its rarity."
"This study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) mutations in cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma with desmoid-type fibromatosis (PTC-DTF) expressing aberrant nuclear and cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for beta-catenin. METHODS: Eight cases of PTC-DTF were available for this study. Immunohistochemistry for beta-catenin and BRAFV600E was performed. CTNNB1 and BRAFV600E mutations were also evaluated by direct sequencing. RESULTS: For beta-catenin, although we could demonstrate aberrant nuclear and cytoplasmic immunoreactivity in DTF components in all cases, suggesting activated Wnt signaling, direct sequencing revealed a missense mutation, c.121A>G (p.T41A), in exon 3 in only one case, and no mutations in exons 3, 4, and 5 in the other cases. In the BRAFV600E analyses, immunohistochemistry revealed positive staining in the carcinoma cells but not DTF components of all cases. These findings were subsequently validated by direct sequencing. CONCLUSION: This study suggests the significance of the BRAFV600E mutation and activation of Wnt signaling pathway in the carcinoma cells and DTF components, respectively. We believe that the CTNNB1 mutations are not the major factor behind beta-catenin translocation indicating Wnt pathway activation. Further study is required to evaluate whether molecular abnormalities other than the CTNNB1 mutation cause activation of Wnt signaling in DTF components of PTC-DTF."
"A wide range of musculoskeletal processes can demonstrate increased uptake on PET-computed tomography (CT) with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) F 18, including reactive, benign neoplastic, inflammatory, traumatic, posttreatment, and arthritic conditions that may mimic malignancy. In addition, physiologic causes of increased FDG uptake such as asymmetric muscle use and presence of brown fat can lead to increased FDG uptake and potential false-positive results. This article presents various case examples of non-malignant musculoskeletal hypermetabolism on 18F-FDG PET-CT and describes useful tools to avoid the potential pitfall of misinterpreting these as malignancy."
"The purpose of this article is to review the etiopathogenesis, molecular cytogenetics, histopathology, clinical features, and multimodality imaging features of desmoid fibromatosis. Recent advances in the management of desmoid fibromatosis will also be discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Desmoid fibromatosis is a rare soft tissue neoplasm with a high incidence of local recurrence. Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of this disease."
"Extra-abdominal desmoid tumor (EDT) is a rare condition, caused by proliferation of fibroblasts. Despite being a benign tumor, it is locally aggressive and has unpredictable clinical behavior. The objective of this study is to present the clinical outcomes of patients with EDT treated surgically between 1995 and 2016. Methods: This is a retrospective series of 23 patients with histopathological diagnosis of EDT that underwent surgery at the orthopedic oncology service of our hospital. The information was obtained from the institute's clinical and pathology reports. Results: A total of 223 medical records with histopathological reports were evaluated. Only 23 cases of EDT were included in the present study. The mean age was 22.5 years. Twelve (52.2%) patients had the tumor on the lower limbs, seven (30.4%) on the upper limbs and four (17.4%) cases were reported on the back. Five (21.7%) patients had tumors measuring less than 5 cm, while eighteen (78.3%) patients had tumors measuring more than 5 cm. All patients underwent surgery as the definitive treatment in our institute. Twelve (52.2%) cases presented negative margins (NM) and eleven (47.8%) cases had positive margins (PM). Local recurrence (LR) occurred in eleven (47.8%) patients. Conclusion: Impairment of the surgical margin was the only prognostic factor found for LR of EDT. Level of Evidence IV, Case Series."
"Mesenteric fibromatosis (MF) is a locally aggressive proliferative spindle cell lesion of the mesentery. A 34-year-old male presented with increasing abdominal pain and constipation. On workup, patient was found to have a large pelvic mass on CT A/P concerning for cancer. The patient underwent surgical excision of >15 cm intra-abdominal tumor along with adherent small bowel section. Histology of the tumor showed a spindle cell lesion consistent with MF. Previous reports have shown association of MF with Gardner syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis. We present the first reported case of MF in a patient with previous neuroblastoma."
"one (anti-active beta-catenin antibody) recognizes hypo-phosphorylated beta-catenin and the other recognizes the total pool of beta-catenin. We validated the strategy in the HCT116 CRC cell line which has an in-frame deletion of beta-catenin serine 45, and then studied human tumor microarrays containing colon adenomas, CRCs, solid pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas as well as the whole tissue sections of CRCs, desmoid fibromatosis, and pilomatrixoma of the skin. In some tumors, we found strong beta-catenin cytoplasmic and/or nuclear staining with the total beta-catenin antibody but no staining with the anti-active beta-catenin antibody. This was inferred to be an altered/mutant beta-catenin staining pattern. All six colon adenomas of the 126 total adenomas studied for the altered/mutant beta-catenin staining pattern had presumptively pathogenic point mutations or deletions in CTNNB1. Four of 10 CRCs with the alterated/mutant beta-catenin staining pattern studied in depth, from 181 total CRCs from tissue microarray, had pathogenic CTNNB1 mutations. The frequencies of CTNNB1 alterations in non-colonic tumors with altered/mutant beta-catenin staining ranged between 46 and 100%. Our results demonstrate that the immunohistochemical approach described here can detect oncogenic forms of beta-catenin in primary tissue samples and can also highlight other tumors with presumptive novel defects activating the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway."
"The surgical management of abdominal wall tumor in women with childbearing potential is a thorny issue. A synthetic mesh is widely used for abdominal wall reconstruction but not necessarily applicable in case of women of childbearing potential because it has been reported to cause severe pain during pregnancy. Autologous reconstruction is usually considered a feasible option for such cases; however, there is no consensus on this approach and almost no evidence to support it. In the present 2 cases, 2 female patients (age, 17 years and 35 years) with abdominal wall desmoid tumor underwent primary radical resection and autologous reconstruction of an abdominal wall defect in the lateral oblique muscle area (defect size, 13 x 5 cm and 8 x 6 cm) using an anterolateral thigh and iliotibial tract flap. The postoperative course was uneventful. Both patients achieved pregnancy and a full-term delivery without complications with the exception of a feeling of mild stretching in the area of the operation. Magnetic resonance imaging and a clinical examination after the delivery revealed no signs of abdominal wall hernia or bulging. Normal pregnancy and full-term delivery could be obtained after abdominal wall resection and autologous reconstruction using an anterolateral thigh + iliotibial tract flap. This reconstructive method is considered to be a versatile option for the management of abdominal wall tumor in women with childbearing potential; however, further evidence should be accumulated on the reconstruction of wider and central abdominal wall defects."
"Desmoid-like fibromatosis (DF) is a rare myofibroblastic benign tumor, often associated with local and repeated injuries, spontaneous regression and stabilization of disease progression suggesting the involvement of altered Wnt/beta-catenin signaling activation and/or aberrant response of the DF cells to external environmental stimuli. The aim of this study was to investigate the response of DF cells to microenvironmental factors such as inflammatory and growth factors or hormones. We observed that the inflammatory cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta1) stimulated cell growth and myofibroblast differentiation of DF cells regardless of the presence of a beta-catenin mutation. The role of TGF-beta1 in cell growth and myogenic differentiation of in vitro cultures of primary DF cells and normal fibroblasts was investigated by gene and protein expression analyses. We demonstrated that TGF-beta1 exerted its role via the canonical Smad pathway with the phosphorylation of Smad3 being crucial for TGF-beta1 dependent DF cell growth and myofibroblastic differentiation. Furthermore we demonstrated that cell confluence is a critical determinant of TGF-beta1 inducing the DF myofibroblast differentiation, implying that the intercellular communications have an important role on the DF myofibroblast behavior. We observed the formation of an increased stress-fiber pattern in DF cells with increased projected cell area and stronger cell-cell contacts in presence of TGF-beta1. These results demonstrated that TGF-beta1 plays a crucial role in the DF cells growth and, together with cell-cell interactions, in DF myofibroblast conversion; we also highlighted that the cellular sensitivity to this cytokine was an intrinsic feature of the DF cells."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) presents a therapeutic dilemma. While lacking metastatic potential, it is a locally aggressive tumor with a strong propensity for occurrence near nerve(s) and recurrence following resection. In this study, the authors introduce the association of an occult neuromuscular choristoma (NMC) identified in patients with DTF. METHODS: After experiencing a case of DTF found to have an occult NMC, the authors performed a retrospective database review of all other cases of biopsy-proven DTF involving the extremities or limb girdles in patients with available MRI data. Two musculoskeletal radiologists with expertise in peripheral nerve imaging reviewed the MRI studies of the eligible cases for evidence of previously unrecognized NMC. RESULTS: The initial case of a patient with an occult sciatic NMC is described. The database review yielded 40 patients with DTF-18 (45%) in the upper limb and 22 (55%) in the lower limb. Two cases (5%) had MRI findings of NMC associated with the DTF, one in the proximal sciatic nerve and the other in the proximal tibial and sural nerves. CONCLUSIONS: The coexistence of NMC may be under-recognized in a subset of patients with extremity DTF. This finding poses implications for DTF treatment and the likelihood of recurrence after resection or biopsy. Further study may reveal crucial links between the pathogenesis of NMC and DTF and offer novel therapeutic strategies."
"Desmoid fibromatosis is a mesenchymal clonal proliferation, which lacks metastatic potential. Nevertheless, it has an infiltrative growth and thus implies a high morbidity1. Although the etiology remains unclear, mutations in the B-catenin or APC genes are involved. Some risk factors include pregnancy, hormonal exposure or surgery. Desmoid fibromatosis can be sporadic (80%) or FAP-associated2. In sporadic cases, it is caused by mutations in the B-catenin (CTNNB1) gene. Whether it is FAP-associated or not should be determined, as the treatment for each condition is different. A radiologic test is essential for diagnosis, although a biopsy is necessary for confirmation. With regard to treatment, there is a wide range of different alternatives such as observation only, medical treatment or even surgery3. However, a recurrence rate that ranges from 30% to 40% have been reported in the major published series4 and thus, conservative treatment is more common nowadays. We present the case of an 82-year-old male with constitutional syndrome. A computed tomography was performed, which identified a 69 x 52mm mass in the oesophago-gastric union. A computed tomography guided biopsy was performed and the histological analysis identified a fusocellular tumor compatible with desmoid fibromatosis. Treatment was started with indomethacin. However, a control computed tomography 3 months later showed that the mass had grown. Thus, indomethacin treatment was stopped and tamoxifen treatment was started. The patient has had an excellent performance status since symptom presentation. In conclusion, desmoid tumors are rare and most are sporadic. However, they may also be associated with familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome. It must be emphasized that our patient did not have any risk factors and the anatomical location in the oesophago-gastric union is not a common location. Desmoid fibromatosis supposes a clinical challenge for diagnosis and treatment and thus, management should be individualized."
"Desmoid tumor, recently renamed as desmoid type fibromatosis, is an uncommon neoplasm. The mesentery is the usual origin of intra-abdominal desmoid-type fibromatosis and despite the fact there is no metastatic potential, it can infiltrate adjacent organs. There etiology remains unknown, preoperative diagnosis is difficult and differential diagnosis includes among other gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). In resectable tumors, the mainstay of treatment is surgical resection with at least clean microscopic margins. We present a case of a 51-year lady who presented with a 6.2 x 4.5 x 3.3 cm neoplasm in the anatomic area of the greater gastric curvature, the splenic hilum and the tail of the pancreas that was diagnosed as GIST on the CT scan. The patient was submitted to laparoscopic excision of the tumor and histopathological examination revealed desmoid type fibromatosis of the splenic hilum infiltrating the spleen, pancreatic tale and greater gastric curvature. According to the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of a sporadic splenic desmoid tumor, which has been treated successfully by laparoscopic en block resection."
"Desmoid fibromatosis (DF) is a rare, unpredictable disease with no established, evidence-based treatments. Individual management is based on consensus algorithms. This study aimed to examine the specific health-related quality of life challenges faced by DF patients, current experiences and expectations of care. METHODS: Twenty-seven DF patients were purposively sampled from The Royal Marsden Hospital. Two focus groups and 13 interviews (males 12, females 15; mean age at study 39.5 years) explored health-related quality of life issues and experiences of healthcare. Thematic content was analysed. RESULTS: Discussions revealed four key themes (diagnostic pathway; treatment pathway; living with DF; supportive care). Diagnostic delay resulted from lack of recognition by patients and healthcare professionals. Some patients received an initial diagnosis of cancer, causing significant distress. Treatment decisions were challenging, and patients experienced uncertainty among clinicians about optimal therapies. Side-effects of treatment were severe, including fatigue, nausea, anorexia, low libido and depression. Pain was the most debilitating symptom and dependency on painkillers was a significant concern. Functional limitation and restricted mobility frequently affected daily activities. Patients experienced difficulty accomplishing their role in society; relationship problems, caring for children, employment and financial difficulties. Social isolation and lack of understanding were common. The psychological impact of this ""life-changing and life-long"" condition was profound. All patients requested knowledgeable healthcare professionals, more information, continuity of care and peer support. CONCLUSIONS: DF patients face complex physical, psychological and practical challenges. Comprehensive care services are needed. Increasing awareness may help to improve diagnostic pathways and overall patient experience."
"Patients undergoing cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy for cancer have an established predilection for hepatitis B virus reactivation; however, the risk associated with newer molecularly targeted agents has not been well investigated. Imatinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, induces rapid and sustained clinical benefit by inhibiting a number of signaling pathways, including BCR-ABL and c-KIT. We report the case of a patient who developed hepatitis B virus reactivation while receiving imatinib therapy for gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Furthermore, a structured literature search of the medical databases consisting of MEDLINE and PubMed was performed using the terms ""hepatitis B"", ""reactivation"", and ""imatinib"". The search identified nine case reports only. The data on patients' characteristics, epidemiology, clinical features, comorbid conditions, diagnosis, and management are summarized. Imatinib-associated hepatitis B virus reactivation was reported in seven patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, one with desmoid tumor, and one with gastrointestinal stromal tumor. This review serves to outline our current understanding of the epidemiology, risk factors, and pathophysiology of chronic hepatitis B virus reactivation secondary to imatinib therapy as well as the current approaches to diagnosis and management of this condition. We aim to increase awareness about this possible association and advocate for hepatitis B virus screening prior to imatinib therapy, especially in patients who are at increased risk for chronic hepatitis B virus infection."
"Systemic doxorubicin is effective for desmoid fibromatosis (DF), but its use is limited by dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. A protocol of selective intra-arterial doxorubicin drug-eluting embolization (DEE) was designed to maximize target tissue efficacy of doxorubicin, while minimizing systemic exposure. Four children with recurrent or refractory DF were treated between 2014 and 2017. Tumor volumes were reduced by 54%-97% over a follow-up interval of 6-32 months. A single patient experienced transient lower extremity paresthesia (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade I). Further investigation is needed to better establish these promising results for doxorubicin DEE in DF treatment."
"Opioids are currently offered as first-line treatment for chronic pain from cancer. Continuous regional analgesia could be an alternative to opioids. However, the required duration of catheterization and the sustained analgesic effects of this technique after catheter removal have yet to be clarified. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a patient with a shoulder desmoid tumour for which monitoring of tumour progression was the sole therapeutic strategy. Analgesia took the form of patient-controlled infusion of local anaesthetics through an interscalene catheter. Due to the need of an MRI control 45 days later, the pump was stopped. The persistence of pain relief 48 hr later led to the decision to remove the perineural catheter. No pain was reported by the patient over the following 42 days. CONCLUSIONS: In this patient, it would seem that continuous analgesia allowed for a sustained resolution of pain from the shoulder-located tumour. One hypothesis is that local anaesthetics play a direct role in the erasure of pain memory. This hypothesis needs to be tested with a large patient cohort. SIGNIFICANCE: This case report provides new insights into the treatment of cancer pain. The most interesting finding is that the pain did remained absent after 45 days of continuous infusion of local anaesthetics through an interscalene catheter. We postulated that local anaesthetic drugs have an impact on pain memory."
"The diagnosis of spindle cell lesions of the breast parenchyma is challenging. Some of these lesions share the expression of CD34, posing differential diagnostic problems, especially in core biopsies. Recently, antibodies against the STAT6 C-terminal, are being used in paraffin-embedded tissues as a surrogate for identifying the NAB2-STA6 fusion gene which is considered a specific molecular marker for solitary fibrous tumor. Accordingly, we investigated the expression of STAT6 in a large series of uncommon spindle cell tumor-like and tumor lesions occurring primarily in the breast parenchyma. We collected 10 classic-type myofibroblastomas, 9 desmoid-type fibromatosis, 6 spindle cell metaplastic carcinoma, 5 benign fibroblastic spindle cell tumors, 3 solitary fibrous tumors, 7 pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasias, 2 reactive spindle cell nodules, 1 leiomyoma, 1 spindle cell lipoma, 1 case of inflammatory pseudotumor, 1 nodular fasciitis, 1 myxoma and 1 dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. A diffuse and strong nuclear STAT6 expression was restricted only to solitary fibrous tumors, while the other lesions were negative or showed only weak cytoplasmic expression. The present study confirms that the demonstration of a diffuse and strong STAT6 nuclear staining is very helpful in distinguishing solitary fibrous tumor from other spindle cell mimics arising in the breast."
"The treatment approach for aggressive fibromatosis is changing. Although surgery is the mainstay in common practice, recent literature is reporting a more conservative approach. We compared the local control rate for surgery, surgery with radiotherapy, radiotherapy alone and a wait and see policy in a systematic review. Methods: A comprehensive search of the databases PubMed/Medline, Embase and Cochrane, of the medical literature published in 1999 till March 2017 was performed by two reviewers, including articles about extra abdominal aggressive fibromatosis without the genetical variants. A total of 671 studies were assessed for eligibility, and 37 studies were included for analysis, representing 2780 patients. Results: The local control rates for surgery alone, surgery and radiotherapy, radiotherapy alone and observation were 75%, 78%, 85% and 78%, respectively. For patients with recurrent disease observation had a better local control rate than surgery alone (p=0.001). In the observation group, stabilization of the tumor was seen in median 14 (range 12-35)months. The time to local recurrence in the treatment group was median 17 (range, 11-52)months. Conclusion: A watchful conservative first line approach with just observation and closely monitoring, by means of physical examination and MRI, appears to be justified in a subgroup of patients without clinical symptoms and no possible health hazards if the tumor would progress."
"To evaluate the safety and feasibility of radical surgery for giant desmoid in abdominal wall accompanied with the repair of giant myofascial defect using synthetic prosthesis. METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and follow-up data of 31 patients with giant desmoid in abdominal wall undergoing radical resection and immediate abdominal wall reconstruction with synthetic prosthesis from January 2007 to January 2017 retrospectively. Patients were recruited at the Diagnostic and Therapeutic Center of Hernia and Abdominal Wall Diseases, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chinese PLA General Hospital and the Department of General Surgery, Chinese PLA General Hospital. Operative conditions, morbidity of complication, short- and long-term outcomes were summarized. All the patients underwent radical resection and infiltrated organs or tissues were simultaneously treated. Synthetic prosthesis was used to perform primary-intention reconstruction of giant myofascial defect in anterior or lateral abdominal wall. Bridging repair procedure for incisional hernia was used to perform double border fixation between prosthesis border and myofascial defect border. Placement and fixation of prosthesis followed the idea of ""conformal repair"", then prosthesis was finally repaired as arch in accordance with original abdominal wall. RESULTS: Of 31 patients, 28 cases were female with mean age of 35.2 (16-58) years and 3 were male with mean age of 42.6 (20-79) years. Six initial cases (19.4%) were diagnosed by preoperative biopsy, and 25 recurrent cases (60.6%) were diagnosed by medical history. The mean minimal diameter of tumors was 18.2 (14-25) cm, and the mean maximal diameter was 45.3 (32-53) cm. All 31 patients underwent radical resection and immediate abdominal wall reconstruction using synthetic prosthesis in bridging fashion successfully, and rapid pathological examination showed that all resection margins were negative. The average operative time was 335 (245-610) min, and the average intra-operative blood loss was 1260 (500-3500) ml. The size of abdominal wall defect after removal of desmoid ranged from 21 cm x 23 cm to 35 cm x 60 cm. The defects in 29 patients were repaired with compound synthetic prosthesis and the defects in 2 patients were repaired with compound prosthesis and polypropylene mesh. Four patients(12.9%) developed postoperative infection, in whom 3 patients had prosthesis infection during 1 month postoperatively, then 1 case recovered with conservative therapy, the other 2 cases were healed after the removal of infected prosthesis at 2 weeks and 3 months postoperatively, respectively; 1 patient had infection of artificial vessel prosthesis and received a second operation to remove the infected artificial vessel. The other 27 patients recovered smoothly and got primary intention wound healing. These 31 patients were followed up for a median of 60.5 (10-121) months with complete data. No marginal recurrence, incisional hernia, and abdominal wall bulge happened. One patient undergoing removal of all anterior and lateral abdominal wall had difficult defecation and urination during the first month after operation, and recovered through practising chest breathing. Ten patients developed fresh desmoids in other body positions postoperatively within 1-3 years, in whom 3 patients died of intestinal obstruction due to rapid neoplasm development and 7 patients survived with tumor receiving conservative therapy. All the 28 survival patients could restore normal life and workand have appropriate sports. CONCLUSION: Radical resection and immediate reconstruction of giant myofascial defect using synthetic prosthesis for patients with giant desmoid in abdominal wall is safe and effective."
"Desmoid tumors (fibromatosis) are intermediate grade, locally aggressive soft-tissue tumors. A rare case of chest wall fibromatosis in a girl with congenital muscular torticollis is being reported. This report also highlights the need for long-term surveillance in such cases, despite being a benign pathology."
"Plexiform fibromyxoma (PF) is a recently-described and rare mesenchymal neoplasm of the gastric wall. A few small case series reports of this spindle cell entity exist in the surgical pathology literature, but to our knowledge no prior endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration cytology examples have been reported. In clinical practice, mural gastrointestinal (GI) lesions are often initially evaluated by endoscopic ultrasound guided (EUS) fine needle aspiration (FNA). In addition, newer EUS fine needle biopsy techniques also allow for reliable retrieval of core tissue samples with intact cellular architecture, making EUS histopathologic analyses possible. We report a combined EUS FNA and core biopsy case of PF and correlate the findings with imaging results. The cytomorphology of PF is described and illustrated, and important entities in the differential diagnosis of upper GI spindle cell lesions (including GI stromal tumor, leiomyoma, schwannoma, carcinoid tumor, desmoid-type fibromatosis, and inflammatory fibroid polyp) are reviewed. Illustrated examples of relevant cytomorphologic, cell block histomorphologic and immunohistochemical characteristics are emphasized."
"- Pleural pathology has been dominated by discussions relating to the diagnosis, prognosis, etiology, and management of malignant mesothelioma. However, there exists a diverse group of other neoplasms that involve the pleura; the most common by far is metastatic carcinoma, usually of pulmonary origin. Other metastatic tumors of varied histogenesis do occur but are less common. Primary pleural neoplasms other than diffuse malignant mesothelioma are either uncommon or rare and have received less attention. OBJECTIVE: - To provide a review of those diverse tumors that can involve the pleura other than mesothelioma in order to facilitate their accurate diagnosis. DATA SOURCES: - Review of relevant literature published via PubMed and other search engines. CONCLUSIONS: - A wide variety of tumors can involve the pleura. In most cases, the approach of considering the morphologic features with appropriate immunohistochemistry, in the correct clinical context, allows for a confident diagnosis. For a number of those soft tissue tumors that are well recognized in the pleura, such as solitary fibrous tumor, desmoid-type fibromatosis, synovial sarcoma, and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, novel markers now exist based on an understanding of the individual tumors' molecular characteristics. Primary pleural lymphomas are rare with poor prognosis. They represent localized specific diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, with either post-germinal center B-cell or plasma cell lineage, arising in the context of either immunodeficiency or immune sequestration and with viral infection."
"To evaluate the impact of hormonal therapy on MRI characteristics of desmoid-type fibromatosis on T1-weighted, T2-weighted fat-saturated and post-contrast sequences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients with histologically-proven desmoid-type fibromatosis were prospectively followed up on MR imaging. Eight patients underwent hormonal therapy and 11 were only surveyed. Change in tumor size during follow-up was analyzed according to RECIST. Signal intensity on T1-weighted, T2-weighted fat-saturated and T1-weighted fat-saturated post-contrast images was graded from 0 to 5 using adjacent normal muscle as reference. Findings were compared with tumor growth and treatment option. RESULTS: There were seven men and 12 women with a mean age of 42.2+/-16.4 (SD) years (range: 18 - 64 years) yielding twenty-six follow-up periods: eight of tumor progression and 18 of tumor stability/regression (some tumors exhibited more than one behavior type). Hormonal therapy was associated with tumor stability or regression (P=0.0207). There was a significant reduction in enhancement among treated patients with stable/regressing disease (P=0.049). The mean variation in enhancement grade was -1.3+/-1.2 in these patients. All successfully treated patients presented a reduction in enhancement. Lesions with marked low enhancement or very low signal on T2-weighted images were rare in progressing lesions (0% and 13%). CONCLUSION: Hormonal therapy has an impact on desmoid-type fibromatosis signal characteristics reducing lesion enhancement."
"Desmoid (desmoid tumor) is a cytologically benign fibrous tumor that originates from musculoskeletal structures of the entire body [1]. The term ""desmoid"", first introduced by Muller in 1838, derives from the Greek word desmos, which means tendinous [2]. The etiopathogenesis of desmoid is not fully understood, most reports of publications regarding its treatment are based on individual case reports. The prognosis is good, and healing is achieved mainly through surgical excision of the lesion. The aim of the paper is to present a case of a 33-year-old woman with diagnosed familial polyposis in the colon, who has been identified with mesenteric desmoid.ic desmoid."
"Sporadic desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) is a rare, chronic, non-metastasising, disease of the soft tissues. It is characterised by local invasive and unpredictable growth behaviour and a high propensity of local recurrence after surgery thereby often having a great impact on health-related quality of life (HRQL). This study aims to review currently used HRQL measures and to asses HRQL issues among DTF patients. METHODS: A mixed methods methodology was used consisting of (1) a systematic literature review, according to the PRISMA guidelines (2009), using search terms related to sporadic DTF and HRQL in commonly used databases (e.g. Embase, Medline Ovid, Web of science, Cochrane Central, Psyc Info, and Google scholar), to provide an overview of measures previously used to evaluate HRQL among DTF patients; (2) focus groups to gain insight into HRQL issues experienced by DTF patients. RESULTS: The search strategy identified thirteen articles reporting HRQL measures using a wide variety of cancer-specific HRQL tools, functional scores, symptom scales (e.g. NRS), and single-item outcomes (e.g. pain and functional impairment). No DTF-specific HRQL tool was found. Qualitative analysis of three focus groups (6 males, 9 females) showed that participants emphasised the negative impact of DTF and/or its treatment on several HRQL domains. Six themes were identified: (1) diagnosis, (2) treatment, (3) follow-up and recurrence, (4) physical domain, (5) psychological and emotional domain, and (6) social domain. CONCLUSION: A DTF-specific HRQL tool and consensus regarding the preferred measurement tool among DTF patients is lacking. Our study indicates that HRQL of DTF patients was negatively affected in several domains. A DTF-specific HRQL measure could improve our understanding of short- and long-term effects and, ideally, can be used in both clinic and for research purposes."
"c.4393_4394delAG in APC gene and a consequent premature stop codon was detected. DTs were diagnosed in 6 individuals, ranging from 2 to 25 years of age. The causes of death were diverse: gastric cancer, rectal cancer and desmoid tumor. The already described genotype-phenotype correlation has proved its worth in this family, as clinical features reflect the mutation location at 3' end of APC gene. The inheritable and lethal nature of the disease needs a tailored follow up approach in order to reduce mortality, optimize local tumor control, and preserve patients' quality of life."
"Various surgical approaches have been described to remove tumours in the parapharyngeal space. This study investigated the feasibility of a transoral approach in the surgical management of parapharyngeal space benign tumours located in the medial portion of the carotid sheaths and extending toward the skull base. METHODS: Thirty-two patients were selected and underwent a transoral or an endoscope-assisted transoral approach in the surgical management of parapharyngeal space benign tumours located in the medial portion of the carotid sheaths. Medical photographs were used. RESULTS: All patients underwent complete resection of their lesions via a transoral or endoscope-assisted transoral approach. None of the patients demonstrated residual or recurrent neoplasms, either clinically or radiographically, during their follow up. CONCLUSION: Based on our studies, we assert that transoral and endoscope-assisted transoral approaches are suitable in managing parapharyngeal space benign tumours located in the medial portion of the carotid sheaths and extending toward the skull base."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) or desmoid tumours are rare benign soft tissue tumours of musculo-aponeurotic origin, which have no malignant potential but are locally aggressive and can result in significant morbidity. They may be hereditary (in association with FAP, i.e. familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome resulting from APC gene mutation) or sporadic, with hereditary cases having a much higher risk of developing DF compared to sporadic ones. Desmoids are known to occur in previous surgical scars. However, previous laparoscopic port site/trocar site is an extremely uncommon site for sporadic desmoids, with only two cases of sporadic laparoscopic trocar site desmoids (occurring in absence of FAP) reported in world literature. We thus describe a case of sporadic DF, occurring at the site of umbilical port 8 months following laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis, treated successfully by margin-negative resection. To the best of our knowledge, this appears to be the first such case in Indian literature and the first being reported after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In the era of laparoscopic surgery, one must be aware of the existence of such an entity after laparoscopy as it may be confused with conditions such as metastatic deposit, port site tumour recurrence, port site hernia, scar site endometriosis, soft tissue sarcoma etc. and may result in diagnostic dilemma."
"Control, paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine/oxaliplatin. Positron emission tomography and immunofluorescence analysis were used to measure the tumor volume and to study the resected tumor, respectively. In vitro, paclitaxel and nab-paclitaxel induced anti-proliferative effects in KKU-100 and KKU-M213 cells. With regards to the treatment regimes, only nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine/oxaliplatin induced antitumor effects in the rat model of thioacetamide-induced IH-CCA. The immunofluorescence study indicated that nab-paclitaxel was more efficient in disrupting cancer-associated fibroblasts than paclitaxel. In conclusion, nab-paclitaxel is effective against IH-CCA owing to its ability to markedly disrupt the desmoplastic stroma."

"Aggressive fibromatosis comprises connective tissue tumours that represent 0.03% of all bodily neoplasms, occurring more often in the abdominal wall, mesentery, and extremities; its location in the breast constitutes a very infrequent type of lesion. Its pathogenesis is diverse and its relationship with augmentation mastoplasty is still unclear. Four cases of aggressive breast fibromatosis following augmentation mastoplasty are reported in this article."
"a complex deletion of APC and a pathogenic mutation of LAMTOR2. Focusing on WT DT subtype, deep sequencing of CTNNB1, APC and LAMTOR2 was conducted on a retrospective series of 11 WT DT using a targeted approach. No other mutation of LAMTOR2 was detected, while APC was mutated in two cases. Low-frequency (mean reads of 16%) CTNNB1 mutations were discovered in five samples (45%) and two novel intra-genic deletions in CTNNB1 were detected in two cases. Both deletions and low frequency mutations of CTNNB1 were highly expressed. In conclusion, a minority of DT is WT for either CTNNB1, APC or any other gene involved in the WNT pathway. In this subgroup novel and hard to be detected molecular alterations in APC and CTNNB1 were discovered, contributing to explain a portion of the allegedly WT DT cases."
"The aim of this study was to analyze chest wall reconstruction following oncologic resection performed by a single surgeon over a 19-year period. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed for 135 patients who underwent oncologic chest wall resection from 1997 to 2015. RESULTS: Average patient age was 57.8 years. Indications for resection were advanced breast cancer (n = 44), soft-tissue sarcoma (n = 38), bone sarcoma or chondrosarcoma (n = 28), desmoid tumor (n = 11), metastasis from other cancers (n = 7), and other primary tumors (n = 7). There were 72 full-thickness and 63 partial-thickness resections (34 soft-tissue resections only and 29 skeletal bone resections only). Resection margins were wide (n = 29), marginal (n = 82), and intralesional (n = 24). Reconstruction was warranted in 118 cases: chest wall stabilization and flap coverage in 57, chest wall stabilization only in 36, and soft-tissue flap coverage only in 25 cases. In total, 82 flaps were performed (17 free flaps and 65 pedicled/local flaps). There were no perioperative mortalities or flap losses. Complications occurred in 29 operations (Clavien-Dindo classifications grade II, n = 12; grade IIIa, n = 4; grade IIIb, n = 10; and grade IVa, n = 3) and 19 reoperations were necessary. Median follow-up was 49 months. Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. One-, 2-, and 5-year survival rates were 84, 82, and 70 percent, respectively. CONCLUSION: With careful patient selection, appropriate perioperative and postoperative care, and accurate surgical technique, even extensive chest wall resections and reconstructions are safe. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) is a rare benign tumor, which occurs in the deep part of bone and muscle fibrous tissue. Clinical and pathological features can be challenging for definitive diagnosis. Here, we report a rare case of a large AF in the axilla. Interestingly, 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed significant increase in standard uptake value. Surgical resection yielded a spindle cell tumor likely of fibromatosis origin which was positive for beta-catenin expression."
"Primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the breast is a metaplastic carcinoma subtype which includes fibromatosis-like and sarcomatoid features. This is a very aggressive tumor with poor prognosis. Other sites of primary SCC should be ruled out first to classify these tumors as primary SCC of the breast. Here we present a case of locally advanced primary SCC of the breast. CASE REPORT: A 72 years old woman presented with a right axillary lump. Trucut biopsy was performed, it showed squamous cell carcinoma. Estrogen receptor had poor immunoreactivity, negative for both progesteron receptor and HER 2 in immunohistochemistry staining. PETCT imaging were conducted to showing only 6x6.5cm mass in right breast adjacent to axilla, multiple lymphadenomegaly in right axillary. We planned neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of weekly paclitaxel followed by epirubicin and cyclophosphamide combination. Postoperative pathology revealed wide necrosis, no viable tumor cell. We started adjuvant anastrozole treatment of 1 mg/day. No evidence of disease was detected after 1 year follow up. CONCLUSION: Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the breast is a very rare disease with no standard treatment approach. Our case achieved pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a benign mesenchymal neoplastic process. It exhibits an uncertain growth pattern and high recurrence rate. Previously radical surgical resection was the mainstay of treatment, but recently more surgeons are opting for conservative management with observation (""wait and see"" policy). The authors intend to evaluate different therapeutic modalities and oncological outcomes for abdominal wall desmoid tumors. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients who underwent surgical, hormonal or chemotherapy treatment for abdominal wall desmoid tumors between 1982 to 2014 at two institutions affiliated with the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. RESULTS: In the study period, 32 patients were included. Twenty-seven patients had surgery upfront. Of those, 89% were women with a median age of 33 years. Mean tumor size was 10 cm. Pathology confirmed free margins in 92% of resections. Tumor recurrence rate was 11%, with median relapse-free survival being 24 months. Multivariate analysis showed that positive final margins (p < 0.001) and positive frozen section (p = 0.001) were independent predictors of recurrence. For the 5 patients who underwent pharmacological therapy, median age was 33 years and median tumor diameter before treatment was 13 cm. Four patients exhibited partial response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). The single patient who did not respond to RECIST underwent radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Desmoid tumor treatment has been evolving over the past decade towards a more conservative approach. Pharmacological treatment may result in tumor size regression. When surgical excision is indicated, positive margins represent an important prognostic factor for local tumor recurrence."
"Desmoid tumors are soft-tissue tumors originating from myofibroblasts with a tendency to recur after surgery. High expression of proliferation markers is associated with shortened progression-free and/or overall survival in many neoplasms, including soft-tissue sarcomas. We investigated the prognostic role of cyclin A and Ki67 in desmoid tumors by immunohistochemistry. METHODS: The study included 76 patients with desmoid tumor operated at Helsinki University Hospital between 1987 and 2011. A tissue micro array (TMA) was constructed and the TMA sections were immunostained with cyclin A and Ki67 antibodies. A computer-assisted image analysis was performed. RESULTS: Cyclin A expression was evaluable in 74 and Ki67 in 70 patients. Cyclin A immunopositivity varied from 0% to 9.9%, with a mean of 1.9%. Cyclin A expression correlated significantly with Ki67. Cyclin A expression was associated with recurrence-free survival (HR 1.9, 95% CI = 1.1-3.2, P = .02), as were positive margin (HR 6.0, 95% CI = 1.6-22.5, P = .008) and extremity location (HR 5.3, 95% CI = 1.7-16.8, P = 0.005). Ki67 immunopositivity varied from 0.33% to 13.8%, with a mean of 4.6%, but had no significant prognostic impact (HR 1.1, P = .2). CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that cyclin A may be a new prognostic biomarker in surgically treated desmoid tumors."
"Infantile fibrosarcoma is characterised by intersecting fascicles of spindle cells and ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion in most cases. Given histological overlap with other spindle-cell tumours, the diagnosis can be challenging and often requires molecular confirmation. A recently developed pan-TRK antibody shows promise for identifying tumours with NTRK fusions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential diagnostic utility of pan-TRK immunohistochemistry for infantile fibrosarcoma. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated whole-tissue sections from 210 cases, including 15 infantile fibrosarcomas; five each lipofibromatosis-like neural tumour and lipofibromatosis; 10 each primitive myxoid mesenchymal tumour of infancy (PMMTI) and low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma; 15 each fibrous hamartoma of infancy (FHI), myofibroma/myofibromatosis and desmoid-type fibromatosis; and 20 each low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, synovial sarcoma, spindle-cell rhabdomyosarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour, fibrosarcomatous dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (F-DFSP) and nodular fasciitis. Immunohistochemistry was performed using a rabbit monoclonal pan-TRK antibody. Immunoreactivity for pan-TRK was observed in all 15 (100%) infantile fibrosarcomas, including diffuse immunoreactivity (>50% of cells) in 14 (93%) cases. Pan-TRK was positive in all five (100%) lipofibromatosis-like neural tumours. Of the 190 histological mimics, diffuse pan-TRK immunoreactivity was noted in 16 (8%) cases, including five PMMTI, five FHI (highlighting predominantly the primitive myxoid spindle-cell components), three F-DFSP, one low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma, one myofibroma and one spindle-cell rhabdomyosarcoma. CONCLUSIONS: Diffuse pan-TRK immunoreactivity is a highly sensitive but not entirely specific diagnostic marker for infantile fibrosarcoma, and may be helpful in selecting patients for TRK-targeted therapy. As expected, lipofibromatosis-like neural tumours, which harbour NTRK1 fusions, also show diffuse pan-TRK immunoreactivity."
"a Desmoid tumor developing in a patient with a history of GIST 3 years ago. It is the first case of GIST with subsequent development of Desmoid tumor to be reported in Saudi Arabia. We discuss the two entities of Desmoid tumor and GIST by comparing their definitions, clinical presentations, histological features, immunohistochemistry stains, molecular pathogenesis, prognosis, and treatment. We also discuss the relationship between GIST and the subsequent development of Desmoid tumors and compare our case with case reports in literature."
"We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of patients who had been treated with meloxicam for the extra-abdominal desmoid tumors and evaluated the correlation between clinical outcome and clinic pathological variables. Methods: Twenty patients treated with meloxicam were followed up every 3 to 6 months. Meloxicam administration was planned at 15 mg/day orally for 6 months. Results: Of the 20 patients evaluated, according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria, there were five patients with partial response (25.0%), eight with stable disease (40.0%), and seven with tumor progression (35.0%). The cumulative probability of dropping out from our nonsurgical strategy using meloxicam was 35.0% at 1 year and 35.0% at 5 years. Conclusions: The present study suggests that conservative treatment would be a primary treatment option for this perplexing disease even though we were not able to determine that the use of a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor would have an additional influence on the natural course of a desmoid tumor."
"Aggressive fibromatoses are histologically benign fibrous neoplasms originating from musculoaponeurotic structures throughout the body. They are locally invasive and erode adjacent vital structures. The head and neck region constitutes 7-25% of all extra-abdominal cases. Case Report: Here, we report the case of a patient with aggressive fibromatosis in the left side of the neck. While the tumor deeply invaded the scalene muscles, the lesion was successfully treated by surgery followed by radiotherapy. The patient has been disease free for the last 7 years following treatment. Conclusion: Due to its unusual location in the head and neck region, aggressive fibromatosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of invading lesions of the neck."
"Although locally invasive or recurrent fibromatosis is primarily treated with surgery, radiotherapy (RT) produces local control for recurrent/unresectable tumors or those with positive surgical margins. Herein, we describe our updated institutional experience with RT to treat fibromatosis. METHODS: Forty-seven patients with fibromatosis received RT between 1990 and 2015, and were followed for >/=12 months. Eight patients received RT for gross tumors, and 39 received postoperative RT after single/multiple prior surgeries. A median dose of 54 Gy was prescribed for definitive RT; 48.6, 50.4, and 54 Gy were prescribed for R0, R1, and R2 resected tumors, respectively. Recurrences were classified as in-field, marginal, or out-field. Prognostic factors were also evaluated. RESULTS: Seven recurrences were noted, including 2 in-field, 4 marginal, and 1 out-field, after a median follow-up of 60 months. In-field recurrences occurred in 1 patient who received 40.5 Gy of salvage RT after postoperative recurrence and another who received 45 Gy for R1 resection after multiple prior operations. All marginal failures were due to insufficient clinical target volume (CTV) margins regardless of dose (3 with 45 Gy and 1 with 54 Gy). On multivariate analysis, a CTV margin >/=5 cm and dose >45 Gy were significant predictors of non-recurrence (p = 0.039 and 0.049, respectively). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with both an CTV margin >/=5 cm and a dose >45 Gy showed a favorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS: RT is a valuable option for treating aggressive fibromatosis; doses >/=45 Gy and a large field produce optimal results. For in-field control, a higher dose is more necessary for gross residual tumors than for totally excised lesions."

"To determine the outcome after radiation therapy for desmoid fibromatosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 50 patients treated between 1988 and 2016 in a specialised bone and soft tissue tumour clinic. RESULTS: The median age at the time of radiation therapy was 36.8 years (range 15.1-69.0) and the median follow-up time was 51 months. Forty-three patients underwent radiation therapy as the definitive treatment with a median dose of 56 Gy (range 30-58.8 Gy). The median dose for the seven patients treated with postoperative radiation therapy was 50.4 Gy (range 48-56 Gy). Eleven patients (22%) developed progressive disease after radiation therapy at a median time of 41 months (range 12-113 months). The recurrences were within the radiation therapy field in four patients and outside the field in seven patients. One patient developed a radiation-induced malignancy 20 years after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation therapy is an alternative treatment in the management of desmoid fibromatosis. It should be considered in patients for whom surgical resection is not feasible, or as adjuvant therapy after surgery with involved margins where any further recurrences would cause significant morbidity."
"Although the majority of low-grade, early-stage endometrial cancer patients have good survival with surgery alone, patients who recur tend to do poorly. Identification of patients at high risk of recurrence who would benefit from adjuvant treatment or more extensive surgical staging would help optimize individualized care of endometrial cancer patients. CTNNB1 (encodes beta-catenin) mutations identify a subset of low-grade, early-stage endometrial cancer patients at high risk of recurrence. Mutation of CTNNB1 exon 3 is classically associated with translocation of the beta-catenin protein from the membrane to the nucleus and activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Given the clinical utility of identifying endometrial carcinomas with CTNNB1 mutation, the purpose of this study was to determine if immunohistochemistry could act as a surrogate for CTNNB1 gene sequencing. Next-generation sequencing was performed on 345 endometrial carcinomas. Immunohistochemical localization of beta-catenin was determined for 53/63 CTNNB1 exon 3 mutant tumors for which tissue was available and a subset of wild-type tumors. Nuclear localization of beta-catenin had 100% specificity in distinguishing CTNNB1 mutant from wild type, but sensitivity was lower (84.9%). Nearly half of CTNNB1 mutant cases had only 5-10% of tumor cells with beta-catenin nuclear localization. The concordance between pathologists blinded to mutation status in assessing nuclear localization was 100%. The extent of beta-catenin nuclear localization was not associated with specific CTNNB1 gene mutation, tumor grade, presence of non-endometrioid component, or specific concurrent gene mutations in the tumor. For comparison, nuclear localization of beta-catenin was more diffuse in desmoid fibromatosis, a tumor also associated with CTNNB1 mutation. Thus, nuclear localization of beta-catenin assessed by immunohistochemistry does not detect all endometrial cancers with CTNNB1 gene mutation. The extent of nuclear localization may be tumor type dependent. For endometrial cancer, immunohistochemistry could be an initial screen, with CTNNB1 sequencing employed when nuclear localization of beta-catenin is absent."
"The first one is a patient who presented with osteomas and hematochezia, being diagnosed with Gardner Syndrome after the colonoscopy. The second patient has a family history of colon cancer, who is diagnosed with FAP with tubular adenocarcinoma. We decide to report both cases due to the absence of previous reports in Peru."
"One of the commonly used systemic agents for the treatment of aggressive fibromatosis is the anti-oestrogen drug tamoxifen. However, data on efficacy and optimum methods of response assessment are limited, consisting mainly of small case series and reports. Methods: A retrospective database was used to identify consecutive patients diagnosed with aggressive fibromatosis (AF) and treated with tamoxifen plus/minus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs at our tertiary referral centre between 2007 and 2014. MRI and symptom changes were recorded. Results: Thirty-two patients (13 male 19 female, median age 41 years) were included. Median duration of treatment with tamoxifen was 316 days. Of 9 patients with progressive disease by RECIST 1.1 (28%): 4 patients experienced worsening symptoms; 3 patients had improved symptoms and 2 had no change in symptoms. Of 22 patients with stable disease (69%): 11 had no change in symptoms; 6 had improved symptoms and 5 patients had worsening symptoms. One patient achieved a partial response with improved symptoms. Conclusions: No relationship was identified between symptomatic benefit and response by RECIST 1.1 on MRI. Prospective studies in AF should incorporate endpoints focusing on patient symptoms."
"The mesenteric desmoid tumor requires special attention and the most demanding treatment. PATIENT CONCERNS: Here we present a rare case of a large mesenteric desmoid tumor secondary to familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) in a 34-year-old man accepted the ex vivo resection, and intestinal autotransplantation. DIAGNOSES: A 34-year-old man was referred to our department with a 6-year history of intermittent hematochezia without any other discomfort after undergoing partial colectomy in February 2013, and 5 endoscopic mucosal resections of colon polyps between May 2012 and July 2015 due to pathological diagnosis of FAP. A computed tomography scan showed a huge abdominal mass with indistinct boundary at the root of the mesentery. The adjacent organs were pushed and most of the superior mesenteric artery branches were infiltrated. INTERVENTIONS: An en bloc resection (R0 resection), and an ex vivo resection followed by intestinal autotransplantation was performed. OUTCOMES: The patient was discharged from the hospital on the 25th day after the operation, and was regularly followed up after surgery with abdominal ultrasonography and laboratory-biochemical tests every month, and serial CT scans every 3 months which showed no evidence of tumor recurrence, thrombus, intestinal obstruction or abdominal infection so far. LESSONS: An ex vivo resection and intestinal autotransplantation appear feasible for cases with pathological lesions involving the vessels at the root of mesentry, and represents an attractive alternative for the management of mesenteric desmoid tumors."
"Hand-foot-skin reaction is a distinct clinical condition arising in association with the use of multikinase inhibitors, including sorafenib. Because multikinase inhibitors are increasingly being used in children with cancer, recognition of this previously unfamiliar condition is of importance to pediatric dermatologists. We describe the diagnosis and successful treatment of a case of hand-foot-skin reaction in a child taking sorafenib for an unresectable desmoid tumor."

"Desmoid-type fibromatoses are rare benign and fibrous tumors that account for approximately 0.03% of total neoplasms. Within this category of neoplasms, pancreatic desmoid-type fibromatosis is an extremely rare subgroup, accounting for approximately 5% of desmoid-type fibromatoses. Although the etiology is unknown, some risk factors include trauma, surgery, family history of desmoid tumor, pregnancy, use of contraceptives, genetic mutation, and familial adenomatous polyposis or Gardner syndrome. Desmoid-type tumors are primarily diagnosed by pathological and immunohistochemical studies. The treatment of choice is surgical resection of the tumor. Systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy are optional treatment approaches for patients with high risk for surgery. The following is a report of an unusual case of a pancreatic desmoid-type fibromatosis in which a very rare variation in the immunohistochemistry findings was demonstrated: slides were immunopositive for S100 protein and not immunonegative. Most desmoid tumors are immunonegative for S100 protein with just a few cases being positive for this protein. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 15-year-old boy, a Chinese national, who was diagnosed as having a pancreatic desmoid-type fibromatosis. He was a healthy individual who was incidentally diagnosed with an abdominal mass. His chief complaints were mild generalized abdominal pain for 1 week, nausea, vomiting, and a low-grade fever. An enhanced computed tomography scan of his abdomen showed a large cystic mass in the anterior surface of the body of his pancreas. He underwent a radical resection of the pancreatic mass, partial pancreatectomy, splenectomy, segmental resection of transverse colon and distal jejunum, and subsequently a one-stage jejunojejunostomy and colonic anastomosis. Postoperatively, he was diagnosed as having a desmoid-type fibromatosis of the pancreas by pathological and immunohistochemical studies. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of desmoid-type fibromatosis is usually incidental and challenging. Pathological and immunohistochemical testing are essential for confirming diagnosis where demonstration of beta-catenin nuclear staining is probably the single most important characteristic. Other markers, such as vimentin, are usually positive, while S100 protein is usually negative. Our case however, confirms that there are rare cases that can be S100 positive. This is the first diagnosed case of pancreatic desmoid-type fibromatosis with S100 protein positivity."
"Desmoid fibromatosis (DF) is a rare, benign soft tissue neoplasm with high rate of local recurrence. Surgical management of DF in the head and neck can be challenging given the desire to balance the preservation of form and function with the need to minimize local recurrence by achieving complete resection. We present two contrasting cases which highlight the advantages of marginal mandibulectomy over segmental mandibulectomy in children with DF. We favor marginal mandibulectomy even with limited bone stock given the remarkable ability of children to generate new bone."
"Since desmoid tumors (DT) exhibit an unpredictable clinical course, with stabilization and/or spontaneous regression, an initial ""wait-and-see"" policy is the new standard of care-thus, the actual challenge is to identify early factors of progression. We present a method of detection of CTNNB1 mutations using a targeted digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) on cell-free DNA (cfDNA) extracted from blood samples of 31 DT patients. Furthermore, we analyzed the correlation between DT evolution and plasmatic concentration of total and mutated cfDNA at the time of diagnosis. Circulating copies of CTNNB1 mutants (ctDNA) were detected in the plasma of 6 patients (33%) but their concentration was not correlated with evolution of the tumor. Concentration of total cfDNA was higher in the plasma of patients with progressive desmoids (p = 0,0009). Using a threshold <900 copies/mL of plasma to detect indolent desmoid and a threshold >1375, it was possible to predict desmoid evolution for 65% of patients by measuring the quantity of circulating DNA in their plasma as early as the time of diagnosis. Albeit showing that the detection of CTNNB1 mutants is possible in the plasma of patients harboring a desmoid tumor, the results of this preliminary study raise the hypothesis that most of the circulating DNA detected in their plasma is derived from non-neoplastic cells, most likely normal neighboring tissues being actively invaded. Our results open the perspective of using cfDNA as a biomarker to predict prognosis at the time of diagnosis and assess tumor dynamics to optimize the treatment strategy."
"The molecular pathogenesis of many forms of soft tissue sarcomas (STS) have been rigorously characterized in the medical literature, which may be particularly important for the diagnosis and prediction of prognosis in STS. METHODS: Electronic databases (2005 to October 2016) were searched. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor and pediatric sarcomas were excluded. The eligible individual study's risk of bias and the quality of aggregate evidence were assessed. Meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 6674 identified articles, 70 were eligible and analyzed, covering 13 types of STS. Meta-analyses showed that the test of detecting MDM2 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization was accurate in differentiating atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma/dedifferentiated liposarcoma from benign tumors (N=971; sensitivity=95%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 89-98; specificity=100%, CI 89-100) or from other STS (N=347; sensitivity=99%, CI 72-100; specificity=90%, CI 78-95); that the test of detecting SS18-SSX fusion by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was accurate in differentiating synovial sarcoma from other STS (N=532; sensitivity=93%, CI 85-96; specificity=99%, CI 96-100). The presence of a CTNNB1 S45F mutation detected by PCR was a risk factor for decreased recurrence-free survival in desmoid tumors (N=418; hazard ratio from 3.50 [CI 1.51-8.14] to 6.20 [CI 2.24-17.15]). CONCLUSIONS: Sarcomas are rare cancers whose molecular pathogenesis is becoming increasingly understood. The current evidence demonstrates that molecular analyses are useful in the diagnosis and prediction of prognosis in some STS."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a benign fibrous neoplasia originating from connective tissue, fascial planes, and musculoaponeurotic structures of the muscles. Currently, there is no evidence-based treatment approach available for desmoid fibromatosis. In this article, a case of a patient in the pediatric age affected by desmoid fibromatosis localized in the orbit is presented. The aim of the article is to describe this unusual and rare location for the desmoid fibromatosis and outline the principle phases in the decision-making process and the therapeutic alternatives for a patient affected by desmoid fibromatosis. Methods: The protocol of this review included study objectives, search strategy, and selection criteria. The primary end point of this study was to analyze the head and neck desmoid fibromatosis. The secondary end point was to identify the available therapies and assess their specific indications. Results: The mean age of patients was 18.9 years ranging from 0 to 66, and 52% were female. A bimodal age distribution was observed, and two age peaks were identified: 0-14 years (57%) and 28-42 years (18%). The most common involved areas were the mandible (25%) followed by the neck (21%). In 86% of the cases, the treatment was the surgical resection of the disease, and only in 5% of the cases, the surgical resection was followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. Conclusion: The orbital location is extremely rare, especially in the pediatric population. The management of desmoid fibromatosis is based on the function preservation and the maintenance of a good quality of life, but in case of symptomatic patients or aggressive course of the disease or risk of functional damages, the surgical approach may be considered. Therapeutic alternatives to surgical resection are radiotherapy and systemic therapy."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis, also called desmoid tumor, is a locally aggressive myofibroblastic neoplasm that usually arises in deep soft tissue with significant potential for local recurrence. It displays an unpredictable clinical course. beta-Catenin, the genetic key player of desmoid tumors shows nuclear accumulation due to mutations that prevent its degradation leading to activation of Wnt signaling and myofibroblastic cell proliferation. The corresponding hot spot mutations are located in exon 3 of the CTNNB1 gene or alternatively, in the APC tumor suppressor gene, most often as a germline mutation. Multifocal desmoid tumors are very rare and clinical characteristics are poorly understood. Here we present six sporadic and one familial case of multifocal desmoid tumors. Four female and three male patients, aged between 7 and 30years (mean 18.4years) were identified in a cohort of 1392 cases. Tumors were located in (distal) extremities, thorax, breast, abdominal wall, shoulder, and neck. Four cases showed a CTNNB1 mutation and one an APC germline mutation. In two sporadic cases no CTNNB1 mutation was identified. Four patients showed (multiple) recurrences and one patient was lost to follow-up. In conclusion, multifocal desmoid tumors are a very rare disease and may occur in sporadic cases that are characterized by recurrent CTNNB1 mutations. However, the underlying pathogenesis of multifocal desmoid tumors remains poorly understood with often aggressive clinical behavior and challenging therapeutical management."
"Papillary thyroid carcinoma with nodular fasciitis-like stroma (PTC-NFS) is a rare lesion with dual pathological features, that behaves more aggressively if positive for beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1) mutations. Recently, we encountered a recurrent PTC-NFS with CTNNB1 mutations. A 48-year-old female presented with a recurrent enlarging tumor with a diagnosis of desmoid-type fibromatosis 6 months after her initial operation for PTC-NFS. Over a 2-year observation period, she underwent remedial surgery to resect the recurrent tumor. During the operation, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve was engulfed and scarified. Local invasion, beta-catenin aberrant staining, and CTNNB1 mutations were detected both in the primary tumor stroma and the recurrent tumor. This case indicates that CTNNB1 mutation screening and beta-catenin staining should be performed in PTC-NFS cases as a predictor for recurrence. If either of these are positive, a wider surgical resection should be adopted to achieve negative margins. Otherwise, radiotherapy should be considered. Furthermore, the lesion might be better known as papillary thyroid carcinoma with desmoid-type fibromatosis in such situations to reflect its local aggressive nature."
"Desmoid tumors (DT) are rare clonal proliferations that arise from mesenchymal cells. These tumors do not metastasize but are locally aggressive, and their growth may lead to significant morbidity. Their clinical course is both variable and unpredictable; tumors may rapidly progress but in other instances remain stable or regress without intervention. AIMS: To examine current treatment of DT and assist with decision-making at time of presentation. METHODS: A literature search was conducted of MEDLINE and Cochrane databases for published studies (1995-July 2015) using the search terms fibromatosis aggressive, desmoid with drug therapy, radiation therapy, prevention and control, radiotherapy, surgery, and therapy. Articles were categorized as surgery, radiation, surgery + radiation, systemic therapy, and front-line observation. Articles were included if they reported a retrospective or prospective comparative or observational study with an analyzed sample size of 10 patients or more with confirmed diagnosis of desmoid tumor and described one of the following clinical outcomes: relapse- or progression-free survival, local control rate, response rate. RESULTS: 258 articles were reviewed; following screening for eligibility, 54 were identified; following full-text screen, 31 were included in final evaluation. The control rate for patients treated with a ""wait and see"" observational approach compared favorably with management with surgery and resulted in disease control rates of between 60 and 92%. CONCLUSIONS: Decision-making in this rare tumor is complicated by the range of treatment options available. Our evidence supports use of an upfront observational approach."
"Desmoid fibromatosis (desmoid tumors) is rare tumors. It can occur as intra-abdominal, extraabdominal, or abdominal wall tumor depending on the site. The abdominal wall type is usually sporadic, but few have been associated with familial adenomatous polyposis. They are commonly seen in young females who are pregnant with a history of the previous cesarean section scar or within the 1(st) year of the last childbirth. There is an association between this tumor, presence of estrogen receptors, and abdominal trauma. We present a 29-year-old Nigerian woman with fungating lower abdominal wall tumor. This tumor is rare, a high index of suspicion will be very important in making the diagnosis."

"This study examined the types of discordance occurring in the diagnosis of soft tissue and visceral sarcomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), and desmoid tumors, as well as the economic impact of diagnostic discrepancies. METHODS: We carried out a retrospective, multicenter analysis using prospectively implemented databases performed on a cohort of patients within the French RRePS network in 2010. Diagnoses were deemed to be discordant based on the 2013 World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Predictive factors of discordant diagnoses were explored. A decision tree was used to assess the expected costs of two strategies of disease management: one based on revised diagnoses after centralized histological review (option 1), the other on diagnoses without centralized review (option 2). Both were defined based on the patient and the disease characteristics, according to national or international guidelines. The time horizon was 12 months and the perspective of the French National Health Insurance (NHI) was retained. Costs were expressed in Euros for 2013. Sensitivity analyses were performed using low and high scenarios that included +/- 20% estimates for cost. RESULTS: A total of 2,425 patients were included. Three hundred forty-one patients (14%) had received discordant diagnoses. These discordances were determined to mainly be benign tumors diagnosed as sarcomas (n = 124), or non-sarcoma malignant tumors diagnosed as sarcomas (n = 77). The probability of discordance was higher for a final diagnosis of desmoid tumors when compared to liposarcomas (odds ratio = 5.1; 95%CI [2.6-10.4]). The expected costs per patient for the base-case analysis (low- and high-case scenarios) amounted to euro8,791 (euro7,033 and euro10,549, respectively) for option 1 and euro8,904 (euro7,057 and euro10,750, respectively) for option 2. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight misdiagnoses of sarcomas, which were found to most often be confused with benign tumors. Centralized histological reviews are likely to provide cost-savings for the French NHI."
"Desmoid tumors are rare benign neoplasms with an aggressive local growth. In children, intra-abdominal localization is less frequent and few reports exist in the literature about the management of DTs in those special patients. In our report, we describe a case of a 13-year old patient with a bifocal intra-abdominal DT, treated unsuccessfully with tamoxifene, and we discuss briefly the existing literature data."
"Dysgerminoma is an uncommon malignant tumor arising from the germ cells of the ovary. Its association with pregnancy is extremely rare; the incidence is about 0.2-1 per 100,000 pregnancies. Because of its infrequency, there are few recommendations regarding its management in pregnancy; therefore, it is important to discuss and summarize the treatment strategy. CASE: We presented a case of a 23-year-old pregnant woman with a large dysgerminoma originated from the right ovary, which had the unusual coincidence of being associated with an abdominal desmoid tumor simultaneously. We did not find any similar cases published in the PubMed database after 1947. A cesarean section was performed at 34 + 6 weeks gestation secondary to her abdominal pain worsening. The patient delivered a healthy boy and had fertility-preserving surgery, followed by 6 cycles of chemotherapy. This case is compared with 21 other reported cases of pure ovarian dysgerminoma in the literature to evaluate the clinical characteristics, feto-maternal compromise, treatment, long-term survival, and fertility outcome. CONCLUSION: The treatment strategy in women with ovarian dysgerminoma should be discussed and structured on an individual basis. If pregnancy is desired, surgical intervention undertaken in the second trimester seems to be the first choice. When chemotherapy is indicated, unless delivery can be accomplished within a few weeks of diagnosis, it should not necessarily be delayed until after delivery. Good reproductive function and high survival rate can be achieved in patients treated with conservative surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF), also known as aggressive fibromatosis, is a locally aggressive benign fibroblastic neoplasm that can infiltrate or recur but cannot metastasize. It is rare, with an estimated annual incidence of two to four new cases per million people. Most DFs occur sporadically, but it may also be associated with the hereditary syndrome familial adenomatous polyposis. Treatment is necessary when the disease is symptomatic, especially in case of compression of critical structures. When possible, surgical resection is the treatment of choice; however, recurrence is common. Due to the high rate of recurrence, imaging plays an important role not only in diagnosis, but also in the management of DF. Although there are a number of studies describing CT and MRI findings of DF, there is no description of contrast-enhanced ultrasound findings."
"Fibromatosis covers a broad spectrum of benign fibrous tissue proliferation and is characterized by slow growing, locally infiltrative growth pattern with a high propensity for local recurrence. We report on a case of multicentric fibromatosis originating from the retroperitoneal space and submandibular triangle, in an 18-year-old lady. Computed tomography revealed a retroperitoneal abdominopelvic tumor extending from the left sub-diaphragmatic space to the pelvic inlet which had enveloped the solid viscera in the left upper quadrant with a displaced celiac axis. She also had a recurrent resectable fibromatosis in left submandibular gland. Histopathological evaluation revealed fibromatosis. Preoperatively, Vinblastin-, Methotrexate-, Tamoxifen-based systemic chemotherapy was offered for 12 weeks in an attempt to downsize the mass. An en bloc complete resection of tumor with multi-visceral resection was performed to achieve negative margins and since then, the patient has remained asymptomatic without any signs of tumor recurrence during the 12th month follow-up visit. Complete resection with negative margins is the treatment of choice and majority of the lesions are amenable for surgical resections. Adjuvant therapy using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, tamoxifen, interferon, anti-neoplastic agents, and radiotherapy, either alone or in combination finds application for un-resectable or recurrent cases."
"The treatment of advanced desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is poorly standardized and primarily based on physician's choice. We assessed systemic treatment preferences for advanced DF among European experts, with the aim to define a control treatment for prospective randomized trials. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A structured questionnaire was sent to a group of physicians involved in DF treatment. RESULTS: 54 experts from 14 countries (Europe, Israel) responded. Disease progression and failure of local therapy were typical indications for systemic therapy. Treatment preferences for patients with sporadic DF versus DF associated with Gardner's syndrome were similar. Physicians use at least 5 different classes of drugs (27 agents). The most frequently used compounds were anti-estrogens and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), in combination or as single agents. The second and third most common systemic approach was chemotherapy based on methotrexate or an anthracycline. Trial activity was limited to 1 country/1 multicentric study. CONCLUSIONS: There is an unmet medical need for evidence-based treatments and well-designed studies. Clinical trials with systemic agents should ideally select a homogeneous DF population with advanced, progressive, ideally symptomatic disease and/or functional impairment after failure of wait-and-see and/or local treatments, and should be randomized, with placebo, anti-estrogens, NSAIDs, or physician's choice as comparator."
"The current report presents a case of an omental fibromatosis discovered incidentally in a 46-year-old woman with no particular medical history and few symptoms. A surgical biopsy was performed initially, and microscopic examination revealed myofibroblastic proliferation. After additional immunohistochemical and molecular analyses, omental fibromatosis was diagnosed. Omental fibromatosis, also called intra-abdominal desmoid, is a rare and benign tumour but can be locally aggressive. Majority of cases are asymptomatic, and difficult to diagnose based on clinical presentation and radiological investigation. Final diagnosis is usually made on histopathology and immunohistochemistry studies. Surgical wide excision is currently the treatment of choice."
"To identify differential clinical and imaging findings between intra-abdominal desmoid tumors and peritoneal seeding that developed after surgery for colorectal cancer. METHODS: 8 patients (9 desmoid tumors) and 11 patients (13 peritoneal seeding masses) were enrolled in our retrospective study. Patients with three or more tumors were excluded. Clinical findings including location of initial tumors, type of surgery, T- and N-stages of initial tumors, time interval between initial surgery and development of intra-abdominal tumors, and level of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were evaluated. Imaging findings of intra-abdominal tumors including size, number, growth rate, location, shape, homogeneity, relative enhancement, and maximum standardized uptake value were evaluated. The Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher's exact test were used to compare clinical and imaging findings between desmoid tumors and peritoneal seeding. RESULTS: In patients with a desmoid tumor, initial T-stage, initial N-stage, and level of CEA at the time of surgery for intra-abdominal tumor were lower than in patients with peritoneal seeding (p = 0.027, p = 0.033, and p = 0.017). The desmoid tumors were frequently located in the small bowel mesentery (p = 0.018) and were larger at detection (p = 0.041). Round or ovoid shapes on CT images were more frequently observed with the desmoid tumors (p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Stage of colorectal cancer, CEA level, and location, size, and shape of new intra-abdominal tumors can be helpful for differentiating between intra-abdominal desmoid tumors and peritoneal seeding in patients with a history of colorectal cancer surgery."
"To investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and differential diagnosis of lipofibromatosis. Methods: The clinicopathological features and immunohistochemical profiles in 8 cases of lipofibromatosis diagnosed at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center from January 2008 to June 2017 were studied. Molecular analysis of beta-catenin mutation by Sanger sequencing, NTKR1 and ETV6 rearrangements by FISH were performed. The follow up information was evaluated and the literature was reviewed. Results: There were 4 males and 4 females with a median age of 1.5 years at presentation (range, 3 months-9 years). Tumor arose in the hand (4 cases), foot (2 cases) and trunk (2 cases), manifesting as a painless subcutaneous mass. Two cases were congenital, one with tumor noted at birth and the others shortly after birth. Grossly, the tumors were poorly defined and irregularly shaped, composed predominantly of fatty tissue which was mingled with fibrous element. They ranged from 1 to 5 cm in size (mean, 2.6 cm). Microscopically, they were characterized by variably sized lobules of adipose tissue traversed by fascicles, bundles or trabeculae of proliferative fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, resembling desmoid tumor. In 2 cases, the tumor infiltrated adjacent skeletal muscles. On high power, the spindled fibroblasts and myofibroblasts had a bland appearance with very low mitotic activity (<1/10 HPF). By immunohistochemistry, they showed variable staining of alpha-SMA, MSA, CD34 and CD99, with negativity for beta-catenin, desmin, h-CALD, EMA, ALK, and S-100 protein. Ki-67 index was low (<2%). Molecular analysis showed no mutation of beta-catenin gene (0/3), no NTRK1 gene rearrangement (0/3) and no ETV6 gene rearrangement (0/2). Follow up information was available in 6 patients, revealed local recurrence in two and persistent disease in one. Conclusions: Lipofibromatosis is a special variant of infantile fibromatosis, which has a predilection for the distal portion of the extremities of neonates and infants and characterized by lobules of adipose tissue traversed by demoid tumor-like fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. However, it differs from desmoid tumor by harboring no mutation of beta-catenin gene. Familarity with its clinicopathological characteristics helps the distinction from its morphological mimics."
"Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) followed by oocyte retrieval is a leading option for fertility preservation before chemotherapy, yet this procedure causes excessive serum levels of estradiol (E2), which are often detrimental for cancer patients. Aromatase inhibitors are often used in breast cancer patients during COH to prevent elevated levels of E2. OBJECTIVES: To describe our experience with COH for oocyte cryopreservation in non-breast cancer patients using aromatase inhibitors. METHODS: Of the five patients treated, two had an aggressive abdominal desmoid tumor, one had endometrial carcinoma, one had uterine sarcoma, and one patient had a brain oligodendroglioma. In all cases the treating oncologist suggested an association between estrogen and possible tumor progression. All patients were treated with a standard in vitro fertilization antagonist protocol combined with aromatase inhibitors, similar to the protocol used for breast cancer patients. RESULTS: The average duration of treatment was 10.5 days, mean peak E2 was 2348 pmol/L, mean number of oocytes aspirated was 17.3, and a mean of 14.6 embryos/oocytes were cryopreserved. CONCLUSIONS: COH with aromatase inhibitors is apparently effective in non-breast cancer patients and spares exposure to high E2 levels."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) of abdominal wall is also called desmoid tumor, ligament tumor, fibrous tissue tumor hyperplasia, tendon membrane fibroma or soft tissue ligament fibroma, etc. Aggressive fibromatosis of abdominal wall was first described by MacFarlane in 1832, and it was named for the first time by Muller according to its general appearance and texture in 1838. This disease has been mistaken for a benign lesions for a long time because when the cells were examined by pathology often show normal mitosis, and distant metastases are not found clinically, but actually the disease is locally invasive and shows a local invasive growth. So it is a rare low-grade malignant soft tissue tumor. At present, the main treatment for the disease is operation, and radiotherapy and hormone therapy have a certain effect, but these therapies are not ideal. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 32-year-old woman, who underwent cesarean section three years ago came to the hospital for finding a mass on abdominal wall for half a month. DIAGNOSES: Mass of abdominal wall. INTERVENTIONS: Underwent surgery. OUTCOMES: Pathology: The lesion is aggressive fibromatosis of abdominal wall (ligament tumor of abdominal wall). LESSONS: We discussed the particularity of its clinical characteristics, treatment strategies and prognosis combined with literature review, and we think the surgeons need to pay high attention to this disease and make more patients get timely, correct and reasonable treatment, so as to improve the quality of life."
"We describe a rare case of aggressive fibromatosis of the larynx occurring in a 72-year-old man. The lesion manifested with complaints of dyspnea and stridor. A computerized tomographic scan of the neck revealed irregular polypoidal growth invading right vocal cord, crossing midline. A malignant tumor was suspected. Although several laryngoscopy-driven biopsies were negative for malignancy, total laryngectomy was done since the lesion was not deemed amenable to conservative therapy. Tissue sections featured a moderately cellular lesion composed of spindle cells with bland, elongated nuclei, enmeshed in a variably collagenized ground substance. The spindle cells were immunopositive for vimentin and negative for cytokeratins, PGP-9.5, smooth muscle antigen, CD68, desmin, and S-100 protein and Ki-67 of 4%. No further therapy was administered. Based on the available literature, our data confirm that aggressive laryngeal fibromatosis in adult patients is a locally infiltrating disease. Total laryngectomy with clear margins is needed as to avoid the high risk of local recurrence."
"Desmoid tumors (DTs) are rare soft tissue neoplasms, especially when originating from the small bowel. An association with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) of the colon has been well documented. Within the FAP population, there is a strong correlation between prophylactic procto-colectomy and subsequent development of DTs. Very few reports describe cases of FAP initially presenting with desmoid-related complications. Therefore, we underwent a review of the literature in order to delineate the characteristics of desmoid tumors occurring as an initial presentation of FAP."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is an uncommon, benign tumor of fibroblastic origin with high potential for local invasion. Less than a quarter of these lesions are located in the head and neck, and although extremely rare, associations have been demonstrated with physical trauma. We describe a unique case of oropharyngeal fibromatosis with traumaticetiology, managed successfully with surgical excision of the lesion with negative surgical margins. A 5-year old patient was found to have an aggressive fibromatosis causing oropharyngeal stenosis following tonsillectomy. We demonstrate that surgical resection with a clear margin allowed for alleviation of stenosis without recurrences reported since the procedure."
"The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to review urological complication rates arising from familial adenomatous polyposis associated desmoid tumours and their management. All patients over a 35-year period were identified from a prospectively maintained polyposis registry database and had an intra-abdominal desmoid tumour. Those without ureteric complications (n = 118, group A) were compared to those that developed ureteric obstruction (n = 40, group B) for demographics, treatment interventions and survival outcomes. 158 (56% female) patients were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 31 years and desmoids typically occurred 3.6 years after colectomy for familial adenomatous polyposis. Ureteric obstruction secondary to tumour growth occurred in 25% of cases. There was no significant difference in gender distribution or overall age at desmoid diagnosis between the two groups. In group B, the median age at desmoid diagnosis was significantly younger in women compared to men (25 and 43 years, respectively) (p = 0.01). Thirty-eight percent of patients already had ureteric obstruction at desmoid diagnosis, the remainder occurred after 48.6 months, but 20 years in two cases. Seventy-three percent (29/40) had ureteric stenting, a long-term requirement for most. Permanent renal injury occurred in six cases but survival between the two groups was not significantly different. Ureteric obstruction occurs frequently in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and an intra-abdominal desmoid tumour. Those most at risk are the young following colectomy. Clinicians should actively survey the renal tract at regular intervals after a diagnosis of an intra-abdominal desmoid tumour as complications can arise insidiously, at any stage."
"Breast fibromatosis, also referred to as desmoid tumor or aggressive fibromatosis, is a very rare, locally aggressive disease that does not metastasize. Bilateral lesions are extremely rare and are found in only 4% of patients with breast fibromatosis. Tumor recurrence following surgery occurs in 18%-29% of patients, most often within the first 2 years after surgery. In this report, we discuss a case of breast fibromatosis, mimicking a breast carcinoma both clinically and radiologically, that presented clinically with dimpling of the skin of the left breast in a 31-year-old woman. The patient relapsed a few months after surgery, with a multicentric and bilateral disease."
"Radiation therapy (RT) is often used in the treatment of unresectable or recurrent aggressive fibromatosis (also known as desmoid tumor) typically with excellent local control. Prior reports have suggested that local control in pediatric patients with aggressive fibromatosis is poor. We aimed to report a long-term single-institution experience with the radiotherapeutic treatment of these tumors with a focus on age-dependent outcomes. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 101 patients treated with RT for aggressive fibromatosis between 1975 and 2015 at a single institution were identified. A variety of demographic and treatment-related variables were abstracted from patients' medical records. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to investigate the relationship between these variables and local control. RESULTS: Overall survival was excellent (98% and 95% at 5 and 10 years, respectively); local control was likewise excellent (82% and 78% at 5 and 10 years, respectively). Patients aged <20 years at diagnosis had significantly worse 5-year local control than those aged >40 years at diagnosis (72% vs 97%; hazard ratio, 9.0; P = .009). Patients treated with once-daily fractionation had significantly improved 5-year local control compared with those treated with twice-daily fractionation (90% vs 73%; hazard ratio, 0.3; P = .008). Neither the presence of gross versus microscopic residual disease, initial versus recurrent presentation, number of prior surgical procedures, nor tumor size had any effect on 5-year local control. In a total of 36.6% of patients, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3 or 4 toxicity developed following treatment; the frequency of toxicities was reduced in patients treated during or after 1995 (24.5%) relative to those treated prior to 1995 (51.9%, P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: RT for aggressive fibromatosis offers excellent local control and should remain the standard of care for patients with unresectable or recurrent disease. Younger patients have diminished local control relative to older patients, suggesting possible biological differences contributing to radioresistance in the pediatric and young adult population."

"Here we report a very rare entity of an infratemporal region aggressive fibromatosis in a 23-year-old Tharu man who had presented with the symptoms of painless but progressive trismus. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of aggressive fibromatosis in a 23-year-old Tharu man. Radiological imaging as well as an immunohistochemistry panel from a biopsy indicated a diagnosis of an aggressive fibromatosis. Since there was no aggravation in his trismus following surgery and because of his poor socioeconomic status, he was advised to attend regular follow-up visits without any adjuvant therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This case report adds to the notion of keeping the differential diagnosis of an aggressive fibromatosis in all patients presenting with progressive but painless trismus. The characteristic imaging findings as well an immunohistochemistry panel will help us clinch the correct diagnosis."
"Desmoid tumor is a rare soft tissues neoplasia characterized by local invasiveness and by a tendency towards local recurrence although not towards metastasization. DISCUSSION: Etiology is not clear. Desmoid tumors originate from the monoclonal proliferation of one mesenchymal cell and develop in the context of fascial, muscular and aponeurotic tissue. They are free of capsule and do not usually metastatize, although they do present a high risk of local recurrence CONCLUSION: In the absence of a systematic data collection and of a clear distinction, in the existing databases, between primitive and recurrent lesions and between lesions of different sites, there are no standard guidelines for a correct management of desmoids. KEY WORDS: Aggressive fibromatos Desmoid tumor, Soft tissue neoplasia."
"Spindle cell lesions of the breast cover a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from reactive tumor-like lesions to high-grade malignant tumors. The recognition of the benign spindle cell tumor-like lesions (nodular fasciitis; reactive spindle cell nodule after biopsy, inflammatory pseudotumor/inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor; fascicular variant of pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia) and tumors (myofibroblastoma, benign fibroblastic spindle cell tumor, leiomyoma, schwannoma, spindle cell lipoma, solitary fibrous tumor, myxoma) is crucial to avoid confusion with morphologically similar but more aggressive bland-appearing spindle cell tumors, such as desmoid-type fibromatosis, low-grade (fibromatosis-like) spindle cell carcinoma, low-grade fibrosarcoma/myofibroblastic sarcoma and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is characterized by desmoid tumors, which are benign soft tissue tumors that can be locally aggressive but typically do not metastasize. Desmoid tumors can manifest anywhere in the body, and those in the abdominal cavity account for approximately 30 to 50% of all such tumors. Complete resection with free margins has been the standard treatment, but non-surgical therapies have been implemented recently. However, if tumors are strongly invasive and/or persistently recur, radical surgical resection with free margins remains the primary treatment. Unfortunately, radical resection may cause large abdominal defects and hinder reconstruction. Several reports and recommendations have addressed this issue; however, to the best of our knowledge, few reports have described complete resection and the subsequent reconstruction of the rectus abdominis muscle. CASE PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old Asian woman presented at our hospital with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. She had abdominal desmoid tumors that required complete resection of her rectus abdominis muscle. Due to necrosis in her own reconstructed tissue, we failed to cover her anterior abdominal wall; thus, we used an abdominal binder as a substitute material to avoid exacerbating the incisional hernia and help her generate intra-abdominal pressure. CONCLUSIONS: This case report may be informative and helpful for the treatment of patients with desmoid tumors, as managing desmoid-type fibromatosis is difficult."
"Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors are commonly associated with genetic syndromes such as familial polyposis coli. Radiological cross imaging studies such as CT and MRI are used in the preoperative work-up of such tumors. Postoperatively, CT and MRI are useful in the assessment of recurrent desmoid tumors. MRI is more accurate in tissue characterization. Where possible, surgical resection remains the standard first-line treatment. For patients where surgery is not possible, or the resection margins are not clear, other forms of treatment are possible. These include hormonal and nonhormonal options. We present a case of a recurrent sporadic intra-abdominal (mesenteric) desmoid tumor. Such an entity is rare with few cases reported in the literature. Treatment options regarding intra-abdominal desmoid tumors will be discussed."
"Neovascularisation is a critical step in the progression of malignant tumors. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (cEPC) have been proposed as surrogate markers of vasculogenesis in malignancies. In this project, we studied the impact of tumor-specific therapy on cEPC and associated angiogenic factors in patients with soft tissue tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients with soft tissue tumors (25 soft tissue sarcomas, 19 GIST, 9 desmoids) and 15 healthy controls were included. Blood samples were obtained at two time points, before and 8 weeks after start of tumor-specific therapy. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated. cEPCs were characterised as CD34(+), CD133(+), CD45(dim), CD31(+) and vascular endothelial growth factor 2 (VEGFR-2) positive cells. Serum concentrations of VEGF-A and angiopoetin-2 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: VEGF-A and Ang-2 concentrations were significantly higher in tumor patients than in healthy controls in both samples (p < .01). Sarcoma patients with progressive disease developed a significant increase in cEPC levels between the two blood samples compared to those with stable disease (p = .002). GIST patients with progressive tumor or metastatic disease showed significant increase in VEGF-A values (p = .01). DISCUSSION: The pre-treatment values of the angiogenic markers did not correlate with the clinical course of the disease. However, cEPCs levels were significantly higher in sarcoma patients with progressive disease compared to those with stable disease and should be further evaluated as early markers of disease progression in sarcoma patients. VEGF-A and angiopoetin-2 clearly play a role as mediators of the vasculogenesis contributing to tumor progression."
"The characteristics of desmoid tumors(DTs)associated with familial adenomatous polyposis(FAP)and relationships between the development of DTs and the sites of APC germline mutation have not closely been examined Japan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was performed to address these issues by examining patients with FAP who underwent proctocolectomy between 1981 and 2015. RESULTS: The cumulative 2-year incidence of DT development was 50%. The DTs developed in the abdominal wall only in 2, in the abdominal wall plus intra-abdominally in 4, and intra-abdominally in 2. Clinical stages according to the Church's classification included Stage I in 3, Stage II in 2, Stage III in 1, and Stage IV in 2. Among 31 patients with a confirmed pathogenic germline APC mutation, patients with mutation in 3' site of codon 1400 (n=7)tended to develop DTs more frequently than those with mutation in 5' site of codon 1400(n=24)(p=0.08). The cumulative 5-year survival rate in patients with DT development was 73.3%. Including 2 patients undergoing initial colectomy at other institutions, the therapeutic efficacy in 4 patients with severe intraabdominal DTs(Stage III /Stage IV )who were given chemotherapy comprising doxorubicin plus dacarbazine(DOX plus DTIC)revealed partial response in 3 and complete response in 1. Febrile neutropenia was recorded in 2 of these patients. CONCLUSION: The frequency of DTs development and genotype-phenotype relationship of FAP patients seems to concur with those reported from Western countries. Since the DOX plus DTIC therapy for severe DTs is valid but toxicity is high, the development of less toxic regimens are warranted."
"Desmoid tumors/aggressive fibromatosis (DT/AF) lack a reliably effective medical therapy. Surgical resection may be morbid and does not preclude recurrence. Radiation may carry severe late effects, particularly detrimental in young patients. At our institution, we recently observed promising results with pazopanib therapy for DT/AF in adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients. PROCEDURE: Retrospective single-institution chart review. RESULTS: Six DT/AF patients of 3-21 years with previously treated DT/AF received pazopanib; 31 DT/AF patients received established therapies only. In both groups, median age at diagnosis was 16 years, female patients comprised 50%, and most common DT/AF site was extremity. Established therapies showed few objective responses and most patients therefore received multiple therapies. Surgical resection had a 68% recurrence rate. Of eight patients who received vinblastine/methotrexate, only one had a partial response (PR) by RECIST 1.1 and five had stable disease (SD); 62.5% required additional therapy. Of seven patients who received sulindac/tamoxifen, none showed objective improvement. In contrast, pazopanib demonstrated best responses by RECIST of PR in two of seven and SD in six of seven tumors. A PR of 66% was observed in a patient who had failed multiple prior therapies. The mesenteric DT/AF also showed PR. Maximum volumetric decrease by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was 97%. Dramatically increased fibrosis was seen on T2-weighted MRI. Patients reported pain relief and improvement in function within 1 month. Except for one case of edema, all other toxicities responded to dose reduction without sacrificing objective treatment response. CONCLUSION: Pazopanib provides a promising, well-tolerated therapy for DT/AF in the AYA population and warrants further study."
"- Patients with rare tumors have difficulty finding reliable information about their disease. Facebook patient support groups allow patients to educate one another. OBJECTIVE: - To investigate how these patients perceive the value of pathologists, both in Facebook groups and real-world patient care. DESIGN: - Survey links were posted in 12 Facebook patient groups: 6 with an active pathologist member (angiosarcoma, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, epithelioid sarcoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans [x2], and desmoid fibromatosis), and 6 without ""active"" pathologist involvement (aggressive angiomyxoma, chondrosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, and osteosarcoma). RESULTS: - A total of 542 people responded (403 were patients): 264 from groups with a pathologist, and 278 from groups without active pathologist involvement. Of groups with an active pathologist, respondents agreed the pathologist's posts helped them better understand their disease (107 of 119; 90%) and relieved some of their disease-related anxiety (92 of 119; 77%). And for these groups 98% (117 of 119) of respondents agreed that having a pathologist in their group was a good thing; 83% (192 of 232) wanted more pathologists involved. More respondents from groups with an active pathologist (219 of 236; 93%) than without one (215 of 252; 85%) agreed: ""pathologists are an important part of the patient care team for patients with cancer and other rare tumors"" ( P = .008). CONCLUSIONS: - This study is the first to evaluate the impact of pathologist interaction with Facebook patient support groups and to assess perceptions about the specialty of pathology from a large group of patients with rare tumors. Pathologist involvement in Facebook patient groups appears to positively influence patient perception of the importance of pathologists. We hope these data will encourage more pathologists to participate in Facebook patient support groups."
"Chest wall neoplasms mainly include malignancies, metastatic in particular. Differential diagnosis should include clinical data; tumor location, extent, delineation; the degree of homogeneity; the presence of calcifications; the nature of bone destruction and the degree of vascularization. The aim of the paper is to present both the benefits and limitations of ultrasound for the diagnosis of chest wall neoplasms. The neoplastic process may be limited to the chest wall; it may spread from the chest wall into the intrathoracic structures or spread from the inside of the chest towards the chest wall. Benign tumors basically originate from vessels, nerves, bones, cartilage and soft tissues. In this paper, we briefly discuss malformations of blood and lymphatic vessels, glomus tumor as well as neurogenic tumors originating in the thoracic branches of the spinal nerves and the autonomic visceral system. Metastases, particularly lung, breast, kidney cancer, melanoma and prostate cancer, are predominant tumors of the osteocartilaginous structures of the chest wall. Plasma cell myeloma is also relatively common. The vast majority of these lesions are osteolytic, which is reflected in ultrasound as irregular cortical defects. Osteoblastic foci result only in irregular outline of the bone surface. Lipomas are the most common neoplasms of the chest wall soft tissue. Elastofibroma is another tumor with characteristic echostructure. Desmoid fibromatosis, which is considered to be a benign lesion with local aggressivity and recurrences after surgical resection, represents an interesting tumor form the clinical point of view. Ultrasonography represents an optimal tool for the monitoring of different biopsies of pathological lesions located in the chest wall. Based on our experiences and literature data, this method should be considered as a preliminary diagnosis of patients with chest wall tumors."
"Desmoid tumor of the breast is a rare benign entity that usually is mistaken for carcinoma clinically and radiologically. We report two cases of desmoid tumor of the breast detected by mammography screening using digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). The larger tumor was detected at both full-field digital mammography (FFDM) and DBT. The smaller desmoid tumor, however, was identified only at tomosynthesis. Mammographic and ultrasonographic findings at diagnostic work-up were consistent with carcinoma of the breast. Preoperative needle biopsies could not conclusively diagnose the lesions. Both patients underwent excisional biopsy and histopathology revealed fibromatosis of the desmoid type."

"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is usually caused by germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. The classic form is characterized by hundreds to thousands of adenomas in the colorectum and early onset colorectal cancer (CRC) if left untreated. FAP is also associated with multiple extra-colonic manifestations such as gastroduodenal polyps, osteomas, epidermoid cysts, fibromas and desmoids. Most desmoid tumours in FAP patients occur intra-abdominally. Approximately 15-20% of the APC mutations are de novo mutations. Somatic mosaicism has been reported in some sporadic cases of polyposis but is probably an underestimated cause of the disease. This case report presents the detection of a mosaic APC mutation in a 26-year-old woman who as a child had been diagnosed with desmoid type fibromatosis. FAP was suggested when she presented with extensive extra abdominal fibromatosis. Our findings indicate that APC mutations may be suspected in patients presenting with a desmoid regardless of its location. If there is clinical evidence that the patient has FAP, adenomas and colonic mucosa in addition to leukocyte DNA should be included in the screening, preferably using methods that are more sensitive than Sanger sequencing."

"Desmoid tumors (aggressive fibromatosis) are locally invasive soft tissue tumors that lack the ability to metastasize. There are no directed therapies or standard treatment plan, and chemotherapeutics, radiation, and surgery often have temporary effects. The majority of desmoid tumors are related to T41A and S45F mutations of the beta-catenin encoding gene (CTNNB1). Using broad spectrum metabolomics, differences were investigated between paired normal fibroblast and desmoid tumor cells from affected patients. There were differences identified, also, in the metabolomics profiles associated with the two beta-catenin mutations, T41A and S45F. Ongoing drug screening has identified currently available compounds which inhibited desmoid tumor cellular growth by more than 50% but did not affect normal fibroblast proliferation. Two drugs were investigated in this study, and Dasatinib and FAK Inhibitor 14 treatments resulted in unique metabolomics profiles for the normal fibroblast and desmoid tumor cells, in addition to the T41A and S45F. The biochemical pathways that differentiated the cell lines were aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis in mitochondria and cytoplasm and signal transduction amino acid-dependent mTORC1 activation. This study provides preliminary understanding of the metabolic differences of paired normal and desmoid tumors cells, their response to desmoid tumor therapeutics, and new pathways to target for therapy."
"To explore the ideal procedure of excision and repair for giant desmoid in the abdominal wall and long-termed follow-up results. Methods: Clinical and follow-up data of 24 patients with giant desmoid in the abdominal wall underwent radical removal and immediate abdominal wall reconstruction in Diagnostic and Therapeutic Center of Hernia and Abdominal Wall Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital of People's Liberation Army General Hospital from October 2006 to October 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. Twenty-one female patients with the mean age of 34.6 years and 3 male patients with the mean age of 42.6 years were recruited. The minimal diameter of these tumors was 15 cm, and the maximal diameter was from xiphoid bone to pubic symphysis. Results: All of desmoids were removed radically and proved by the rapid pathologic examination. The size of abdominal wall defect after desmoids removal were 483 (21 cmx23 cm) to 2 100 cm(2) (35 cmx60 cm), averaged 945 cm(2) (27 cmx35 cm). All of defects were repaired with compound synthetic prosthesis using bridging procedure. Twenty-one patients were recovered smoothly and got primary wound healing. Three patients had prosthesis infected during 1 month postoperatively and 1 patient recovered with conservative therapy, the other 2 patients underwent infected prosthesis removal at 2 weeks and 3 months postoperatively, respectively. Twenty-two patients were followed up with the period of 12 to 121 months and the median period was 63 months. No marginal neoplasm recurrence, incisional hernia, and abdominal wall bulge happened. Eight patients developped fresh desmoids in the abdominal cavity or in the back. Two patients died because of intestinal obstruction due to desmoid infiltration, and the other 6 patients still survived along with stable desmoids. Conclusions: Radical removal for patients with giant desmoid in the abdominal wall is an ideal therapeutic method, and compound synthetic patch can be used to repair huge abdominal wall defect, even the defect compromised all of abdominal wall. The long-termed follow-up results showed these procedures had not put bad influence on the quality of patients' life."
"Benign mesenchymal tumors of the abdomen are-except for hemangiomas-rare neoplasms that are associated with potentially life-threatening complications. Thus, awareness of the most important entities and knowledge of their imaging characteristics is fundamental for the radiologist. OBJECTIVES: An overview of the most frequent benign abdominal soft tissue tumors and their common imaging features is given. Furthermore, other facts concerning the individual entities that are relevant to radiologic practice are outlined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search and evaluation of the institutional image database were performed. RESULTS: Hemangiomas, desmoid tumors, lipomas and lipoma variants are presented. Typical characteristics and radiological signs (e. g., iris diaphragm sign, band sign, India ink artifact) are elucidated and illustrated by image examples. CONCLUSION: Despite the lack of distinctive imaging features, there are a few radiological characteristics suggestive for each of the entities that in many cases allow for correct diagnosis. In cases of doubt, biopsy or surgery is necessary to distinguish them from malignancies."
"Treatment algorithms for patients with aggressive fibromatosis (AF) are challenging. There are limited data available about the use of systemic therapy (ST) in pediatric patients with AF. METHODS: Patient-, tumor-, and treatment-related factors of 90 children and adolescents with AF treated on multiple prospective trials of the Cooperative Weichteilsarkom Studiengruppe (1981-2015) were analyzed with focus on response and outcome of ST. RESULTS: Median age was 9.48 years (0.02-18.05). Primary resection was performed in 54 patients and ST was administered in 29 of 54 patients because of disease progression or relapse. In 35 patients, ST was the initial treatment modality. A secondary resection was performed in 21 of 35 patients after ST. A total of 64 patients received ST, mainly methotrexate and vinblastine (40%) with a median duration of 380 days. The most frequent radiological response to ST was stable disease at 3 months (39%) and partial response at 6 months (53%). Radiotherapy was administered to 15 of 90 patients. One patient remained on observation only. The 5-year overall survival was 100% and the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) was 44%. Patients who had a primary resection showed a 5-year EFS of 35% versus 59% in patients who had received primary ST (P = 0.08). Functional deficiencies as long-term sequelae following resection occurred in 11 patients. At a median follow-up of 5.05 years (0.25-14.88), complete remission was achieved in 51 patients and partial remission in 28 patients. CONCLUSIONS: ST seems appropriate if a primary complete resection is not feasible and at relapse/progression after resection."
Level V: Expert opinion.
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is a aggressive (myo)fibroblastic neoplasm with an infiltrative growth and a tendency to local recurrence. Resection of the tumour and/or radiation were proposed as principal treatment. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the local control rates focusing on the effect of surgical margins and radiotherapy. METHODS: From 1981 to 2014, 44 patients had been treated. Fifty four therapies had been applied, in 50 cases surgery +/- radiation therapy, NSAIDs or chemotherapy. In 4 cases a conservative approach was chosen. Thirty seven patients had primary, 17 recurrent disease. Endpoint was either local recurrence (LR), progression of residual disease or rare non-metastatic secondary lesions at the same extremity. RESULTS: The mean age was 39,4 years. In 17 cases a R0, in 27 a R1 and in 6 cases a R2 resection was achieved. Four patients were treated conservatively. All together in 21 cases radiotherapy, in 5 NSAIDs, in 3 imatinib and in 2 cases each tamoxifen or chemotherapy had been applied. The median follow-up was 119 months. 5-year recurrence free survival after resection was 78%. 10 (20.4%) patients developed LR between 5 and 42 months after therapy. Recurrent disease was a negative factor on LR. Margins, radiotherapy, sex, or size of the tumour had no significant impact on LR. Patients younger than 40 years had a significant higher risk of LR. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical margins are less important than keeping function. Radiotherapy might be an option in unresectable lesions, the role of adjuvant radiotherapy is controversially discussed."
"Desmoplastic fibroblastoma (collagenous fibroma) is an uncommon benign soft-tissue tumor, rarely involving bone. It shares some overlapping features with other infiltrate tumors, such as desmoid-type fibromatosis, neurofibroma, and low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma. The misdiagnosis may cause unnecessary surgical overtreatment, especially for those involving bone. In order to deepen the understanding of the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of desmoplastic fibroblastoma, we planned to analyze the clinical, radiological, and histopathological features and the outcome of desmoplastic fibroblastoma on the basis of case analysis and literature review. METHODS: Sixteen cases were retrieved from the surgical pathology records from May 2011 to April 2016 in the Department of Pathology in Beijing Jishuitan Hospital. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of 16 cases of desmoplastic fibroblastoma were collected. Hematoxylin and eosin stain and immunohistochemistry were used to observe the histological features of desmoplastic fibroblastoma of soft tissue and bone. The images for diagnosis obtained from the ultrasonic examination, X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography were used to observe the radiological features. Related literatures were retrieved from the PubMed and CNKI databases. RESULTS: Sixteen cases of desmoplastic fibroblastoma of soft tissue were located in the hand (n = 7), foot (n = 4), upper arm (n = 1), shoulder (n = 1), forearm (n = 2), and one case occurred in the proximal femur. Age ranged from 32 to 82 years (median age: 58 years). There were six females and ten males. Histologically, the lesions of soft tissue appeared as well-circumscribed masses with abundant collagenous matrix and low vascularity. Tumor cells were stellate- or spindle-shaped and uniformly distributed within the extracellular matrix. In five cases, the desmoplastic fibroblastoma were found to have infiltrated into the skeletal muscle tissue. In one case of desmoplastic fibroblastoma of bone, radiographs revealed osteolytically well-defined lesion. Immunohistochemistry stain showed that vimentin and smooth muscle actin were positive in all cases of desmoplastic fibroblastoma. CONCLUSIONS: Desmoplastic fibroblastoma (collagenous fibroma) has prominent clinical, histopathological, and radiological features. Before the differential diagnosis from other tumors is obtained by thorough analysis and comparison of the similar and different characteristics, the appropriate surgical management and accurate prognosis evaluation could not be delivered to the patient."
"A 55-year-old female patient reported with an intraoral well-localised asymptomatic swelling on the right side of the mandible in relation to the right mandibular first molar along with a history of trauma 6 months back. Panoramic radiograph revealed normal trabecular bone pattern in relation to the lesion. The lesion was excised along with the associated buccal cortical plate and tooth. The microscopic examination revealed a well-circumscribed lesion consisting of spindle cells arranged in storiform pattern associated with the buccal cortical plate. The key feature to note was presence of reactive periosteum, which was in continuum with the lesion. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed faint nuclear positivity for beta-catenin. The above findings led to our diagnosis of periosteal desmoid, which is rarely reported in the head-and-neck region. The major challenge in the diagnosis of such lesions is good clinicopathological correlation as the differential diagnosis of spindle-cell lesions is vast and needs IHC confirmation."
"An extensive 35 x 20 cm sized full-thickness abdominal wall defect was created after resection of aggressive abdominal fibromatosis in a 19-year-old male patient. Immediate reconstruction was not possible due to prolonged operation time and resulting severe bowel edema. A silicone sheet with NPWT was applied over the exposed viscera. After 1 week, silicone sheet was substituted with a composite mesh. Then, abdominal wall reconstruction with bilateral free anterolateral thigh (ALT) flaps (30 x 12 cm and 25 x 12 cm sized) was performed. Since there was only a single reliable recipient vessel available, we linked 2 ALT free flaps sequentially in a flow-through fashion to the left inferior epigastric artery and vein. Two donor sites were closed primarily. The flap fully survived and the defect was covered successfully without any complication for 11 months of follow up. Multiple flaps may be needed for large full-thickness abdominal wall defect coverage. Linked fasciocutaneous free flaps could be a solution with a less donor site morbidity even in the case of limited available recipient vessels. The purpose of this study is to introduce our experience of extensive full-thickness abdominal wall reconstruction using only ipsilateral deep inferior epigastric vessels."
"Pathological diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) in the pediatric population is challenging, as it occurs uncommonly in this age-group and resembles other spindle cell neoplasms. SFT contains a NAB2-STAT6 fusion gene, which can be reliably detected using STAT6 immunohistochemistry. Positive staining is highly sensitive and specific. We sought to investigate the utility of STAT6 immunohistochemistry, to show how commonly SFT was historically recognized at 3 academic pediatric institutions, to reclassify them when appropriate, and to demonstrate features of major mimics of SFT. Our series included cases with a previous diagnosis of SFT or for which SFT was among key considerations, from 3 major academic pediatric hospitals seen over the past 30 years. Of 18 tumors identified, only 3 tumors from 2 patients demonstrated positive STAT6 staining as well as the typical histology and immunophenotype seen in SFT. The remaining 15 tumors were reclassified based on morphology, additional immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization as desmoid-type fibromatosis (3 tumors), nerve sheath/neural tumors (3 tumors), low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, medallion-like dermal fibroma, poorly differentiated Sertoli cell tumor, nodular/proliferative fasciitis, calcifying fibrous tumor, aneurysmal bone cyst of soft tissue, STAT6-negative SFT with adipocytic differentiation, undifferentiated small round blue cell tumor, and scar (1 tumor each). Our study confirms that SFT is rare in the pediatric population and that it is potentially overdiagnosed. STAT6 immunohistochemistry is recommended to confirm the diagnosis of SFT in the pediatric population."
"To evaluate the clinical significance and rarity of tamoxifen retinopathy after a long-term tamoxifen treatment for an inoperable desmoid tumor. METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: Tamoxifen retinopathy is a condition rarely observed in clinical practice. Although tamoxifen is typically a treatment for breast cancer patients, we present a 68-year-old woman taking tamoxifen for an inoperable desmoid tumor, an equally rare condition. She presented with bilaterally deteriorating vision over the course of a year. Fundoscopic examination revealed parafoveal deposits bilaterally. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography exhibited hyperreflective deposits in all layers of the retina. She had a cumulative treatment dose of 292 g of tamoxifen, and the medication was subsequently stopped. Her vision remained stable 3 months after the cessation of tamoxifen. CONCLUSION: The development of tamoxifen retinopathy in the treatment of a desmoid tumor makes this case a rare entity, and this is the first reported case of these two concomitant conditions to our knowledge. With the use of long-term tamoxifen as a primary treatment, we recommend screening at regular intervals by an ophthalmologist as an integral part of treatment."
"desmoid tumor (DT) or aggressive fibromatosis, tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) or diffuse-type pigmented villonodular synovitis (dtPVNS), and giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB). Intermediate histologies include tumors of both soft tissue and bone origin and are locally aggressive and rarely metastatic. Some common aspects to these tumors are that they can be locally infiltrative and/or impinge on critical organs, which leads to disfigurement, pain, loss of function and mobility, neurovascular compromise, and occasionally life-threatening consequences, such as mesenteric, bowel, ureteral, and/or bladder obstruction. DT, PVNS, and GCTB have few and recurrent molecular aberrations but, paradoxically, can have variable natural histories. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended for optimal management. In DT and PVNS, a course of observation may be appropriate, and any intervention should be guided by symptoms and/or disease progression. A surgical approach should take into consideration the infiltrative nature, difficulty in obtaining wide margins, high recurrence rates, acute and chronic surgical morbidities, and impact on quality of life. There are similar concerns with radiation, which especially relate to optimal field and transformation to high-grade radiation-associated sarcomas. Systemic therapies must be considered carefully in light of acute and chronic toxicities. Although standard and novel therapies are promising, many unanswered questions, such as duration of therapy and optimal end points to evaluate efficacy of drugs in clinical practice and trials, exist. Predictive biomarkers and novel clinical trial end points, such as volumetric measurement, magnetic resonance imaging T2 weighted mapping, nuclear imaging, and patient-reported outcomes, are in development and will require validation in prospective trials."
"Background To evaluate the efficacy and safety of doxorubicin (ADM) combined with thalidomide (THA) as a first-line treatment for patients with refractory aggressive fibromatosis (AF). Patients and Methods Eligible patients were treated with ADM 30 mg/m(2) on days 1-2 and THA 200 mg nightly on days 1-21 every 3 weeks for a maximum of six cycles. THA was then continued for a total of 1 year. The primary end point was response rate (RR). Results Fifteen patients were enrolled in the study. No patient had a complete response, but five patients had partial responses, resulting in a RR of 33%. Eight patients (53%) had stable disease and two patients (13%) had progressive disease, and the disease control rate was 87%. The median progression free survival (mPFS) was 20.6 months (95% confidence interval, 14.5-26.7 months). Patients with below normal baseline serum albumin levels had significantly inferior mPFS compared with those with normal baseline serum albumin (1.4 months versus 23.7 months, P = 0.045). Grade 3/4 toxicities included leukopenia (33%), neutropenia (60%), febrile neutropenia (7%), nausea (7%), and vomiting (6.6%). Conclusions ADM plus THA was well-tolerated and effective as a first-line treatment for patients with refractory AF. However, patients with hypoalbuminemia at baseline had inferior clinical outcomes, and further studies are needed to investigate this issue."
"To assess the efficacy of conservative chemotherapy for inoperable desmoid tumor (DT) and analyze the prognostic factors. Methods: From November 2008 to April 2016, 71 patients of inoperable DT were treated with vinorelbine and low-dose methotrexate in the Department of Bone and Soft Tissue Tumors, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, and enrolled in this retrospective study. The chemotherapy duration is one year. The efficacy of chemotherapy and the prognosis were observed. Results: Of the 71 patients, 55% were female. Age of onset varied from 1 to 47 years, and the median age was 14 years. Only 11 (15.5%) cases suffered primary tumor. The distribution of the site of tumors was: 31 (43.7%) in the trunk, 36 (50.7%) in the limbs, and 4 (5.6%) in the peritoneal and pelvic cavity. The size of tumor (the maximum diameter) differed from 2 to 37 cm with a mean of 9.3 cm. The median follow-up duration was 28 (range, 6-87) months. Common side effects included: nausea and vomiting, liver injury, bone marrow suppression and oral ulcers. When the chemotherapy finished, 1 (1.4%) case achieved complete response, 24 (33.8%) achieved partial response, 37 (52.1%) achieved stable disease and 9 (12.7%) had progressive disease. The overall response rate was 87.3%. The progression-free survival (PFS) of the participants were from 6 to 87 months, and the 2-, 3- and 5-year PFS was 79.9%, 68.4% and 36.3%, respectively. No significant difference was identified in PFS in subgroups of gender, age of onset, age of chemotherapy, tumor site and tumor size. Conclusions: For recurrent, inoperable and progressive DT, enough course of chemotherapy with vinorelbine combined with low-dose methotrexate was an optional choice for local control."

"The treatment of aggressive fibromatosis poses a therapeutic challenge in an interdisciplinary setting. The extent of surgical resection is still discussed controversially. The present retrospective analysis aimed to determine prognostic factors leading to recurrence. Between 2000 and 2014, 114 patients with aggressive fibromatosis were treated surgically at BG-University Hospital Bergmannsheil (Bochum, Germany). Univariate and multivariate analyses were restricted to 90 participants with information available on surgical margins at the initial procedure. The median follow-up time was 7.7 years. A total of 45 patients (50%) developed recurrence during follow-up. Primary tumors were resected with negative margins (R0) in 50 patients (68%) and with microscopically positive margins (R1) in 28 patients (25%). In addition, tumors in 12 patients (7%) were resected with macroscopically positive margins at the initial surgical procedure. The rates of recurrence-free survival (RFS) after 5 years were 68.8% [95% confidence interval (CI), 53.5-79.9%] in patients with R0-resected primary tumors and 34.1% (95% CI, 19.9-48.9%) in patients with R1/R2-status (P=0.001). Narrow and wide clear margins within the R0-group were not associated with significantly different outcomes. Adjuvant radiation, tumor site and patient age were not associated with a significant alteration of RFS. The current results suggest that the attainment of microscopically negative surgical margins at the initial surgical treatment is associated with a significantly improved prognosis. A conservative surgical approach involving the attainment of narrow negative margins while preserving function should be sought in patients in whom tumor resection is indicated. The decision for resection should be made interdisciplinary in each case based on tumor progression, available treatment alternatives and the decision of the informed patient."
"A primary desmoid tumor arising from the chest wall is extremely rare. We report the case of a 57-year-old man presenting with a desmoid tumor arising from his chest wall. Chest radiograph at a regular medical checkup indicated an abnormal shadow. By computed tomography-guided biopsy, he was diagnosed as having a desmoid tumor. He underwent right-sided chest wall resection and reconstruction. Desmoid tumor is histopathologically benign tumor, however, they tend to show high rates of local recurrence after surgery. In case of recurrence on unresectable case, radiotherapy or some medical treatment should be chosen as a treatment option."
"Treatment of recurrent aggressive fibromatosis (AF) following surgical resection is a clinical challenge. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported to be an effective option for controlling the disease. However, long-term NSAID use can result in unfavorable complications. This study was a trial of the use of intralesional steroid injection (ILSI) including investigation of safety margins and clinical outcomes of high-dose steroids for local use treatment of AF. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of particulate corticosteroids for AF. Intralesional steroid injections of Kanolone(R) guided by ultrasound were given monthly for three consecutive months with 1 mg/kg/episode (a total of 3 mg/kg). Patients were followed up monthly for 3 months at the time of each monthly injection and then for an additional 3 months after the last injection. Complications from the procedure and clinical outcomes were monitored. RESULTS: Eight recurrent AF patients completed the full 6-month evaluation process. No procedure-related complications were reported either during the injection period or the follow-up period. None of the patients developed Cushingoid features. The highest number of complication events, all of which were mild or detectable only by laboratory analysis, occurred during the month following the second injection. Triamcinolone levels were significantly increased 24 h after injection, and four of the eight cases developed hypothalamic-pituitary-axis suppression. Tumors were stabilized in 83.3% of the cases during the study period, and pain and functional ability scores improved significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Intralesional steroid injection appears to be a safe and effective alternative treatment for recurrent AF.

"Infantile desmoid fibromatosis of the postcricoid area is a rare disease and is characterized by a proliferation of fibrous tissue with non-metastasis, local infiltration, and a high rate of recurrence after surgical resection. Currently, ultrasound is scarcely used in the hypopharynx and larynx area. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 4-year-old boy presented with hoarseness, deep voice and snoring for 2 approximately 4 years without any surgical history. On sonography, the lesion was found in the postcricoid area, and the left larynx showed impaired mobility in real time observation. Complete excision with a negative margin in this pivotal anatomic area is impossible, and necessitates a long-time surveillance. DIAGNOSES: Infantile desmoid fibromatosis of the postcricoid area was diagnosed according to surgery and histopathology. INTERVENTIONS: Local excision was carried out to relieve the upper airway narrowing. OUTCOMES: Relieved hoarseness and snoring were reported on the latest follow-up. A residual lesion was seen in the surgical bed and maintained a stable extent on ultrasound and MR imaging after a year. LESSONS: Considering the non-radiation merit and diagnostic ability, ultrasonography is advocated as a valuable supplementary imaging method to CT, MR and laryngoscopy in the juvenile larynx and hypopharynx."
"Desmoid tumors (DT) are mesenchymal neoplasms that are considered locally invasive but non-metastasizing. [1][2][3] They are also known as aggressive fibromatosis, deep fibromatosis and musculoaponeurotic fibromatosis. Even though they do not metastasize, they are locally invasive and cause significant morbidity and mortality. The management of DT is challenging and requires a discussion at a multidisciplinary tumor board (MTB). DT is primarily treated with surgery with or without radiation therapy (RT). Despite surgical resection, DT have a high rate of local recurrence, and hence, they have been labeled as intermediate locally aggressive tumors by World Health Organization (WHO).[4] According to the WHO, DT is a ""clonal fibroblastic proliferation that arises in the deep soft tissues and is characterized by infiltrative growth and a tendency toward local recurrence but an inability to metastasize,"" even though it may be multifocal in the same limb or body part. Systemic chemotherapy is used in patients where surgery and RT are either not feasible or will not achieve a cure."
"Fibromatosis is a rare, benign, slow-growing and locally infiltrative tumour, caused by uncontrolled proliferation of fibrous tissue arising from muscles, connective tissue, fasciae and aponeurosis. It is also called desmoid tumour, which is very rare pathology representing only 0.03% of all neoplasms in human and around 3% of all soft tissue tumours. It is locally aggressive and usually invades the surrounding structures and has a high recurrence rate, even after surgical complete resection, which should be the first line of treatment. Here, we report a very rare case of extensive and disabling fibromatosis tumour in a 38-year male, involving three compartments of the right side of the head, neck and chest wall, which was completely excised surgically and had excellent postoperative results with no morbidity."
"An unusual case of a jejunal mesenteric pseudocyst treated by laparoscopic resection is reported. A 44-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with intermittent upper abdominal pain and diarrhea. Physical examination revealed slight periumbilical tenderness, and no masses were palpable. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a 4-cm-sized nonenhancing high-density mass with a heterogeneous pattern on a proximal small bowel loop. Based on these findings, a gastrointestinal stromal tumor accompanied by hemorrhagic and cystic change, a mesenteric hematoma, or a desmoid tumor was diagnosed. Laparoscopy was performed to obtain an accurate diagnosis. Exploration of the abdominal cavity identified a 4-cm mass originating from the mesentery of the jejunum. Segmental resection of the jejunum and its mesentery, including the mass, was performed. Macroscopically, the mass appeared to be a cystic mass of the jejunal mesentery. The mass within the cyst lumen consisted of white clayish material with no specific pathology. The final pathological diagnosis was a mesenteric pseudocyst. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course."

"Desmoid type fibromatosis (DTF) is a rare, locally invasive, non-metastasizing soft tissue tumor. We report an interesting case of DTF involving the pancreatic head of a 54-year-old woman. She presented with intermittent dysphagia and significant weight loss within a 3-mo period. Laboratory findings showed mild elevation of transaminases, significant elevation of alkaline phosphatase and direct hyperbilirubinemia, indicating obstructive jaundice. Computerized tomography of the abdomen revealed a mass in the head of the pancreas, dilated common bile duct, and dilated pancreatic duct. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic ultrasound showed a large hypoechoic mass in the head of the pancreas causing extrahepatic biliary obstruction and pancreatic ductal dilation. The patient underwent a successful partial pancreatico-duodenectomy and cholecystectomy. She received no additional therapy after surgery, and liver function tests were normalized within nine days after surgery. Currently, surgical resection is the recommended first line treatment. The patient will be followed for any recurrence."
"Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors are usually slow growing and solitary, but multifocal desmoid tumors develop on rare occasions. Diagnosing desmoid tumors before histological examination of a surgical biopsy is often difficult. In particular, if a patient has a prior history of malignancy, it may be difficult to differentiate between these lesions and disease recurrence or metastasis. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a rare case of multiple rapidly growing intra-abdominal desmoid tumors after surgical trauma, without familial adenomatous polyposis. A 51-year-old male underwent abdominal perineal resection with lateral lymph node dissection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for lower rectal cancer. Follow-up computed tomography (CT), performed 6 months after primary surgery, showed a 20-mm solitary mass in the pelvic mesentery. Another CT scan, performed 3 months later, revealed that the mass had grown to 35 mm in size and that two new masses had formed. Based on imaging studies and his medical history, it was difficult to distinguish the desmoid tumors from recurrence of rectal cancer. Curative resection was chosen for therapeutic diagnosis. The pathological diagnosis was multiple mesenteric desmoid tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Desmoid tumors should not be excluded as a differential diagnosis for intra-abdominal masses after intra-abdominal surgery, even in cases of rapidly growing multiple masses."
"Desmoid tumors, also known as aggressive fibromatoses, are clinically rare soft-tissue tumors that arise from such connective tissues as the musculoaponeurotic structures. The majority of the reported intra-abdominal desmoid tumors occur in the small intestinal mesentery and peritoneum, whereas stomach desmoid tumors are extremely rare. The present study reports a case of stomach desmoid tumor and reviews the related available literature. The diagnosis of the stomach desmoid tumors can be made with routine pathological and immunohistochemical examinations. Compared with desmoid tumors at other sites, the currently preferred treatment of the stomach desmoid tumors with negative margins is radical resection of tumors. All the follow-ups of patients with the stomach desmoid tumors show no obvious recurrence, suggesting that the prognosis of the stomach desmoid tumors is good."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a rare and locally aggressive monoclonal, fibroblastic proliferation characterized by a variable and often unpredictable clinical course. Currently, there is no established or evidence-based treatment approach available for this disease. Therefore, in 2015 the European Desmoid Working Group published a position paper giving recommendations on the treatment of this intriguing disease. Here, we present an update of this consensus approach based on professionals' AND patients' expertise following a round table meeting bringing together sarcoma experts from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma Group with patients and patient advocates from Sarcoma PAtients EuroNet. In this paper, we focus on new findings regarding the prognostic value of mutational analysis in desmoid-type fibromatosis patients and new systemic treatment options."
"Wnt signaling is implicated in tumor cell dedifferentiation and cancer stem cell function. Ipafricept (OMP-54F28) is a first-in-class recombinant fusion protein with the extracellular part of human frizzled 8 receptor fused to a human IgG1 Fc fragment that binds Wnt ligands. This trial evaluated ipafricept in patients with solid tumors.Experimental design: A 3+3 design was used; ipafricept was given intravenously every 3 weeks. The objectives were determination of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary efficacy.Results: 26 patients were treated in seven dose-escalation cohorts (0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg). No further dose escalation was pursued as PK modeling indicated that the target efficacious dose was reached at 10 mg/kg, and fragility fractures occurred at 20 mg/kg. Most common related grade 1 and 2 adverse events (AEs; >/=20% of patients) were dysgeusia, decreased appetite, fatigue, and muscle spasms. Ipafricept-related grade 3 TEAEs included hypophosphatemia and weight decrease (1 subject each, 3.8%). Ipafricept half-life was approximately 4 days and had low incidence of antidrug antibody formation (7.69%) with no impact on drug exposure. Six patients had beta-C-terminal telopeptide (beta-CTX) doubling from baseline, which was reversible. PD modulation of Wnt pathway genes in hair follicles occurred >/=2.5 mg/kg. Two desmoid tumor and a germ cell cancer patient experienced stable disease for >6 months.Conclusions: Ipafricept was well tolerated, with RP2D of 15 mg/kg Q3W. Prolonged SD was noted in desmoid tumor and germ cell cancer patients. Clin Cancer Res; 23(24); 7490-7. (c)2017 AACR."
"MEDI-570 is a fully human afucosylated monoclonal antibody (MAb) against Inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS), highly expressed on CD4+ T follicular helper (TFH) cells. Effects of MEDI-570 were evaluated in an enhanced pre-postnatal development toxicity (ePPND) study in cynomolgus monkeys. Administration to pregnant monkeys did not cause any abortifacient effects. Changes in hematology and peripheral blood T lymphocyte subsets in maternal animals and infants and the attenuated infant IgG immune response to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) were attributed to MEDI-570 pharmacology. Adverse findings included aggressive fibromatosis in one dam and two infant losses in the high dose group with anatomic pathology findings suggestive of atypical lymphoid hyperplasia. The margin of safety relative to the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for the highest planned clinical dose in the Phase 1a study was 7. This study suggests that women of child bearing potential employ effective methods of contraception while being treated with MEDI-570."
"We report the case of a 16-year old patient presenting with giant, multinodular, mesenchymal tumor of the abdominal wall occupying the left abdominal region and measuring 25 cm on the vertical axis, 20 cm on the transverse axis, mobile when compared with the deep structures and gradually increasing in volume over childhood and neglected. After small biopsy, which showed desmoid tumor, the patient underwent complete surgical resection of the tumor with immediate reconstruction by free muscolo skin flap of the latissimus dorsi attached to the large blood vessels of the inguinal fold (left iliac artery and left external iliac vein), connected by termino lateral anastomosis. Flap survival was correctly performed and reconstruction was successful."
"Accurate diagnosis of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is often challenging on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or core needle biopsy. Recurrent mutations in EED and SUZ12, which encode subunits of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), have been identified in 70% to 92% of MPNSTs; PRC2 inactivation leads to loss of trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3). We evaluated the utility of H3K27me3 immunohistochemistry for distinguishing MPNST from its cytomorphologic mimics. Methods: H3K27me3 immunohistochemistry was performed on 180 cases of spindle cell neoplasms sampled by FNA (n = 66) and needle biopsy (n = 114), and loss of nuclear staining was scored. Tumor types included MPNST, dedifferentiated liposarcoma, schwannoma, solitary fibrous tumor, leiomyosarcoma, melanoma, synovial sarcoma, sarcomatoid carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, desmoid fibromatosis, low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, and unclassified spindle cell sarcoma/undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. Results: Complete loss of H3K27me3 was observed in 54% (13/24) of MPNSTs. In contrast, only two (of 156) histologic mimics showed complete loss of H3K27me3. Partial loss of H3K27me3 was present in a subset of cases (26/180), including both MPNST and non-MPNSTs. Conclusions: Complete loss of H3K27me3 is a highly specific (98.7%) marker of MPNST that can distinguish MPNST from cytomorphologic mimics in FNA cell block and small biopsy specimens."
"The outcomes, complications, and rates of secondary malignancies from radiation therapy (RT) are not known for patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). METHODS: We queried the Hereditary Gastrointestinal Cancer Registry (HGCR) for patients with FAP who received RT. Outcomes assessed included acute and late treatment toxicity and secondary malignancies. RESULTS: We identified 15 patients undergoing 18 treatment courses. Median follow-up was 3.1 years after RT. Treated sites included rectal cancer, desmoid, prostate cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, medulloblastoma, gastric cancer, and glioma. Secondary tumors occurred in two patients: a medulloblastoma was diagnosed in a patient treated for glioma, and a desmoid tumor was diagnosed in a patient treated for rectal cancer. All nine patients treated with intra-abdominal or pelvic RT had prior prophylactic proctocolectomies, yet only one patient experienced grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (CTCAE v4) toxicities were grade 1 in seven treatment courses (39%), grade 2 in five courses (28%), and grade 3 in two courses (11%). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, RT was well tolerated with adverse effects comparable with non-FAP patients. Secondary in-field tumors occurred in 2 of 15 patients and their increased risk in this cohort was likely due to prior predilection from FAP itself, although an increased role of RT cannot be ruled out."
"Desmoid fibromatosis is a fibroblastic neoplasm driven by aberrations within the WNT pathway, exhibiting mutations in beta-catenin or APC. We review the long-term follow-up of patients in a phase I study treated with an oral gamma secretase inhibitor, PF-03084014. METHODS: PF-03084014 was administered orally at doses ranging from 20 to 330 mg twice daily. Tumor assessments were performed using computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) within 4 weeks of study entry, and every other cycle through cycle 9. After cycle 9, patients were evaluated as clinically indicated. RESULTS: Seven patients with desmoid fibromatosis were treated between December 2009 and December 2016 at the University of Colorado. Five patients (71.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 29.0-96.3%) achieved a partial response (PR), with a mean time to achieving response of 11.9 months (95% CI 2.5-21.4 months). All patients who achieved a PR continue to maintain responses between 47.9 and 73+ months. Four patients stopped treatment yet remain free of progression between 11 and 53+ months. One patient had PFS of 42+ months, with a 17% decrease in the target lesion. A biopsy performed at the end of the study showed decreased tumoral cellularity compared with previous biopsies. Effective treatment doses ranged from 80 to 330 mg administered orally twice daily. CONCLUSIONS: PF-03084014 was effective in treating desmoid tumors, with an objective response rate of 71.4% (95% CI 29.0-96.3%) in this small cohort of patients. PF-03084014 exhibits promising activity, even at relatively low doses (80 mg twice daily), with high tolerability leading to prolonged disease control even after therapy discontinuation."
"Plexiform fibromyxoma is a very rare mesenchymal tumor of the stomach, found almost exclusively in the antrum/pylorus region. The most common presenting symptoms are anemia, hematemesis, nausea and unintentional weight loss, without sex or age predilection. We describe here two cases of plexiform fibromyxoma, involving a 16-year-old female and a 34-year-old male. Both patients underwent complete resection (R0) by distal gastrectomy and retrocolic gastrojejunostomy (according to Billroth 2); for both, the postoperative course was uneventful. Histology showed multiple intramural and subserosal nodules with characteristic plexiform growth, featuring bland spindle cells situated in an abundant myxoid stroma with low mitotic activity. Immunohistochemistry showed alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive spindle cells, focal positivity for CD10, and negative staining for KIT, DOG1, CD34, S100, beta-catenin, STAT-6 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase. One of the cases showed focal positivity for h-caldesmon and desmin. Upon follow-up, no sign of disease was found. In the differential diagnosis of plexiform fibromyxoma, it is important to exclude the more common gastrointestinal stromal tumors as they have greater potential for aggressive behavior. Other lesions, like neuronal and vascular tumors, inflammatory fibroid polyps, abdominal desmoid-type fibromatosis, solitary fibrous tumors and smooth muscle tumors, must also be excluded."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) or desmoid tumors is an aggressive fibroblastic proliferation which is locally invasive but can not metastasize. The treatment of AF is challenging. Surgery was the main treatment modality for AF in the past, other strategies including radiotherapy, systemic therapies and wait-and-see policy. The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and targeted therapies has demonstrated good results. In the case report, a 39-year-old man presented with progressive chest wall pain. Computed tomography (CT) showed an approximately 46x 13 mm soft-tissue mass between the inside of the fifth and sixth rib on the right side. The entire mass was excised and an AF was confirmed based on histopathology. Four months after surgery, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a soft-tissue mass in surgical areas and biopsy confirmed local recurrence. Therefore, Tomotherapy was administered. However, two months later, an (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography combined with CT (PET-CT) revealed the presence of an FDG-avid mass in the area of local recurrence. Genetic testing reported the presence of a p.T41A mutations on the CTNNB1 gene, which predicted that he is sensitive to the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. The tumor regressed rapidly after the application of celecoxib. Within the 20-month follow-up period, the patient showed remarkable regression without any signs and symptoms. Our case report provides further evidence for the efficacy of celecoxib in AF with CTNNB1 gene mutations. To our knowledge, this is the first report of AF treated with celecoxib under the guidance of the genetic testing. However, further studies are required."
"Thoraco-abdominal wall resection including diaphragm resection results in a challenging surgical defect. Various methods have been used for diaphragm reconstruction. The aim of this study was to describe our methods of diaphragm and thoraco-abdominal wall reconstruction after combined resection of these anatomical structures. METHODS: Twenty-one patients underwent diaphragm resection at our institution between 1997 and 2015. We used a mesh or direct closure for diaphragm defect and a mesh for chest wall stabilization. A pedicled or free flap for soft tissue coverage was used when direct closure was not possible. RESULTS: Indications for resection were primary sarcoma (n = 14), cancer metastasis (n = 4), desmoid tumor (n = 2), and solitary fibrous tumor (n = 1). The median patient age was 58.9 years. The diaphragm was pulled to its original position and sutured directly (n = 15) or reconstructed with mesh (n = 6). Chest wall reconstructions were performed with a mesh (n = 14), mesh and a pedicled flap (n = 4), mesh and a free flap (n = 3). No perioperative mortality occurred. One-year and 5-year survival rates were 85.7 and 65.9%, respectively, while overall recurrence-free rates were 80.4 and 60.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We have described our surgical methods for the resection of tumors of the chest or abdominal wall, including our method of distal diaphragm resection with wide or clear surgical margins. The method is safe and the reconstructions provided adequate stability, as well as water-tight and air-tight closure of the chest cavity. There were no cases of paradoxical movement of the chest or of diaphragm or thoraco-abdominal hernia."
"Immunohistochemical staining with conventional anti-beta-catenin antibody has been applied as a diagnostic tool for desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF). This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of immunohistochemical staining with anti-non-phospho beta-catenin antibody, which might more accurately reflect the aggressiveness of DF, in comparison to the conventional anti-beta-catenin antibody. METHODS: Between 2003 and 2015, 40 patients with extra-peritoneal sporadic DF were prospectively treated with meloxicam or celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, therapy. The efficacy of this treatment was evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Immunohistochemical staining was performed on formalin-fixed material to evaluate the expression of beta-catenin and non-phospho beta-catenin, and the positivity was grouped as negative, weak, moderate, and strong. DNA was isolated from frozen tissue or formalin-fixed materials, and the CTNNB1 mutation status was determined by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Of the 40 patients receiving COX-2 inhibitor treatment, there was one with complete remission, 12 with partial remission, 7 with stable disease, and 20 with progressive disease. The mutation sites in CTNNB1 were detected in 22 (55%) of the 40 cases: T41A (17 cases), S45F (3 cases), and T41I and S45P (1 each). The positive nuclear expression of non-phospho beta-catenin showed a significant correlation with positive CTNNB1 mutation status detected by Sanger method (p = 0.025), and poor outcome in COX-2 inhibitor therapy (p = 0.022). In contrast, nuclear expression of beta-catenin did not show a significant correlation with either CTNNB1 mutation status (p = 0.43) or outcome of COX-2 inhibitor therapy (p = 0.38). CONCLUSIONS: Nuclear expression of non-phospho beta-catenin might more appropriately reflect the biological behavior of DF, and immunohistochemical staining with non-phospho beta-catenin could serve as a more useful diagnostic and prognostic tool of COX-2 inhibitor therapy for patients with DF."
"Interventional radiology has revolutionized the local management of bone tumours, offering new minimal invasive alternatives to surgery and radiotherapy. Its role has continuously increased over the past years for the treatment of benign tumors and also of some malignant ones, especially in palliative situations. The development of protective techniques and new ablative technologies, such as cryoablation, contributes to expand the role of the interventional radiologist to new fields of applications in musculoskeletal oncology."
"Desmoid tumors are borderline tumors of the connective tissue, arising in the musculo-aponeurotic stromal elements. A desmoid tumor (DT) has an infiltrative and locally aggressive growth pattern and usually does not metastasize; however, it has a high recurrence and complication rate. DT located in the breast (BDT) represents a rare extra-abdominal form. Recently, the presence of breast silicone implants was suggested by several researchers as a risk factor for developing BDT. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this review is to investigate the possible correlation between BDT and breast implant surgery. METHODS: We conducted a literature review of BDT-reported cases, associated with breast implant surgery. RESULTS: The search revealed 36 cases of BDT associated with silicone breast implants. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the reviewed data, the incidence of BDT following breast implant surgery is lower than BDT in the general population. At the moment, a possible association between breast implants and the development of breast desmoid tumors cannot be unequivocally confirmed. A world registry with accurate documentation of each case of BDT associated with breast implant surgery should be performed for future investigation.

"Fibromatosis of the breast is a rare benign disease compromising <0.2% of all primary breast tumors. Although the chest wall is a common location, occurrences of implant-associated fibromatosis of the breast are extremely rare; only 33 cases have been reported. We present a case of a 42-year-old female who underwent breast augmentation with silicone breast implants, and 2 years later developed an aggressive implant-associated fibromatosis of the breast and chest wall. On imaging studies, the tumor mimicked breast carcinoma, and despite chemotherapy, the fibromatosis rapidly enlarged and was locally invasive requiring wide surgical excision. Unlike previously reported imaging findings, magnetic resonance imaging revealed an oval circumscribed mass with fringe-like internal architecture. We provide a review of the literature and discuss the imaging features of implant-associated fibromatosis of the breast."
"Fibrous tissue proliferations express a wide spectrum of histologic and morphologic variation in both infants and adults. This ranges from hypertrophic scar formation at one end to malignant fibrosarcoma at the other end of the spectrum. Aggressive fibromatosis is an intermediate tumor which is in proximity to fibrosarcomas. These are locally invasive and often recur after excision, but do not metastasize. Histologically, they are characterized by proliferating fibroblasts with little mitotic activity. Aggressive fibromatosis in the head and neck region is not common, and very sporadically occurs in the oral cavity or jaw bones. Here we report a rare case of aggressive fibromatosis occurring in a 5 year old boy."
"Desmoid tumours represent a major complication of familial adenomatous polyposis. Our aims were to study the factors associated with the development of desmoid tumours in familial adenomatous polyposis patients, and to describe presentation and management of desmoid tumours. METHODS AND PATIENTS: We reviewed all patients with familial adenomatous polyposis followed at our institution between 1965-2013, with either identified adenomatous polyposis coli gene mutation, or a personal and family history suggesting adenomatous polyposis coli-related polyposis. Response to treatment of desmoid tumours was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumor (RECIST) criteria. RESULTS: A total of 180 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis were included with a median follow-up of 19 years since diagnosis. Thirty-one (17%) patients developed 58 desmoid tumours, a median (range) 4.7 (0.8-41.6) years after their diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis. The only factor significantly associated with occurrence of desmoid tumours was the type of surgery: 12 (12%) desmoid tumours in 104 patients treated by colectomy, versus 19 (25%) desmoid tumours in 76 patients treated by proctocolectomy, p = 0.027. The localisation of desmoid tumours was: mesenteric (n = 25), abdominal wall (n = 30) or extra-abdominal (n = 3). Nineteen patients underwent 36 surgical procedures for desmoid tumours. Recurrence occurred in 26 (72%) cases and the recurrence-free survival was 2.6 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.2-5.9) years. Thirteen patients received 27 medical treatments over a median 14 months. Objective response was observed in four (15%) patients and the median progression-free survival was nine (95% CI, 1.1-16.9) months. CONCLUSION: If confirmed, colectomy (versus proctocolectomy) should be performed in adenomatous polyposis coli-related familial adenomatous polyposis patients to avoid desmoid tumours. We show that there is a high prevalence of post-surgical recurrence and the low efficacy of available medical treatments for desmoid tumours."

"A 19-year-old woman presented with painless swelling of the abdomen. During surgery, a giant mass measuring 37 cmx26 cmx12 cm within the distal pancreas invading the spleen was noted. The clinical diagnosis of a solid cystic pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas was suspected. Distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, and debulking surgery were performed. Histological examination showed that the tumor infiltrated the spleen and pancreatic parenchyma, and sections of the solid areas revealed a proliferation of spindle-shaped or stellate cells growing in fascicular and storiform patterns within a myxoid intercellular matrix. Cystic areas were representing the entrapped excretory pancreatic ductules. Interestingly, there were two ectopic adrenal tissues found incidentally in the peripheral portion of the tumor. The histopathologic and immunohistochemical features were consistent with a solid cystic desmoid tumor of the pancreas. Desmoid tumors of the pancreas are very rare, and if they present as a solid cystic lesion, their diagnosis may be difficult. We report the case for its rarity and huge size and to emphasize a regular follow-up because the long-term prognosis is currently unknown."
"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) with desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) is characterized by genetic alterations of the fibroblasts. PTC-DTF is extremely rare, and the reports on such cases have been sporadic. Immunohistochemical staining using the antibody for beta-catenin is useful in diagnosing the variant. This report aims to describe the clinical, pathological, and immunohistochemical findings in 14 cases of PTC-DTF and to clarify the diagnostic significance of the variant. The patients included 9 women and 5 men, with a mean age of 49.3 years. PTCs with focal DTF components and with extensive DTF components included 7 cases each. No significant differences were noted in terms of age, gender, and serum thyroglobulin levels between extensive and focal DTF cases. On aspiration cytology, 12 cases were reported as suspicious for malignancy or malignant, and schwannoma or fibroma was suggested in 1 case each. The DTF components were histologically classified into 4 types, namely, central (4 cases), peripheral (1 case), mixed (7 cases), and diffuse type (2 cases). The stromal components were consistent with those of DTF. Immunohistochemically, fibroblasts in the DTF components showed nuclear and cytoplasmic expression for beta-catenin in 12 cases. The features are observed even in cases in which stromal components focally exist. Neither carcinoma cells nor the fibroblasts with Ki-67 labeling index >5% were found in all cases. We agree that PTC with nodular fasciitis-like stroma should be renamed to PTC-DTF."
"Mammary fibromatosis is a rare and locally aggressive benign tumor of the breast; it originates from fibroblasts and myofibroblasts within the breast parenchyma and does not metastasize. The condition is locally aggressive and has a high rate of recurrence. The etiology of mammary fibromatosis is unknown. Breast imaging examinations are not specific for fibromatosis and often imitate breast cancer. The current study presents 2 cases of women with breast fibromatosis, the first of which exhibited a locally advanced aggressive form of the disease, where breast surgery and en bloc resection of the underlying regions of the thoracic wall were required. In the second case, breast imaging examinations suggested an invasive breast tumor, probably carcinoma, infiltrating the muscles of the chest wall. An ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy revealed a low-grade myofibroblastic proliferation consistent with breast fibromatosis. The patient underwent a right quadrantectomy, with a partial resection of the underlying musculature. The patients remain disease-free at the time of writing. As involvement of the breast in patients with desmoid-like fibromatosis as rare, the present study reports 2 cases with clinical features and histological findings in order to improve and add to the knowledge of this disease."
"Desmoid tumors are locally aggressive fibroproliferative neoplasms that can lead to pain and dysfunction due to compression of nerves and surrounding structures. Desmoid tumors often progress through medical therapy, and there is frequently a delay of multiple months before radiation can provide symptomatic relief. To achieve more rapid symptomatic relief and tumor regression for unresectable desmoid tumors causing significant morbidity such as brachial plexus impingement with loss of extremity function, we have selectively utilized a combination of imatinib and radiation therapy. Here, we retrospectively review four patients treated with concurrent imatinib and radiation therapy. The treatment was typically tolerated with minimal toxicity though one patient developed avascular necrosis of the irradiated humeral head possibly related to the combined treatment. All the patients treated have had a partial response or stable disease on imaging. Improvement of symptoms was observed in all the treated patients with a median time to relief of 2.5 months after starting radiation therapy. Concurrent radiation and imatinib may represent a viable treatment option for unresectable and symptomatic desmoid tumors where rapid relief is needed to prevent permanent loss of function."
"Myofibroblastic, fibroblastic and/or myoid lesions are rare in the breast but comprise the majority of mammary mesenchymal spindle cell lesions. Whereas most have similar features to their counterparts at extramammary sites, pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia is considered a breast-specific myofibroblastic proliferation on the same spectrum as myofibroblastoma. Other lesions with myofibroblastic/fibroblastic differentiation include fibromatosis and nodular fasciitis, as well as more aggressive tumors such as the rarely reported myofibrosarcoma, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor and fibrosarcoma. Lesions with myoid differentiation include benign leiomyoma, myoid hamartoma and leiomyomatous myofibroblastoma, but primary leiomyosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma may also rarely arise in the breast. Furthermore, fibroepithelial lesions and metaplastic carcinomas can demonstrate myoid metaplasia. Diagnosis can be challenging, particularly on core biopsy, but benign lesions with or without recurrence potential must be distinguished from more aggressive tumors, especially metaplastic carcinoma and phyllodes tumors. This article will review lesions with myofibroblastic, fibroblastic and myoid differentiation in the breast, with special emphasis on differential diagnosis."
"We report the case of a 32-year-old gravida 2 para 1 woman with a background of partially resected desmoid tumor (DT) arising from the previous cesarean section (CS) scar. This case details the management of her DT by surgical resection and mesh repair and second pregnancy following this. Pregnancy-related DTs are a relatively rare entity, and there is a paucity of literature regarding their management during pregnancy. There are only five reported cases of DTs arising from CS scars. To our knowledge, this is the only report to illustrate that subsequent CS is possible after desmoid resection and abdominal mesh repair. It provides evidence that CS can be safely accomplished following abdominal wall reconstructions and further arguments against elective lower segment CS."
"The outcome of desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) is unpredictable. Currently, a wait-and-see approach tends to replace large en bloc resection as the first therapeutic approach. Nevertheless, there are no validated factors to guide the treatment choice. METHOD: We conducted a prospective study of 771 confirmed cases of DTF. We analysed event-free survival (EFS) based on the occurrence of relapse after surgery, progressive disease during the wait-and-see approach, or change in therapeutic strategy. Identification of prognostic factors was performed using classical methods (log-rank test and Cox model). RESULTS: Overall, the 2-year EFS was 56%; this value did not differ between patients undergoing an operation and those managed by the wait-and-see approach (53% versus 58%, p = 0.415). In univariate analysis, two prognostic factors significantly influenced the outcome: the nature of diagnostic sampling (p = 0.466) and primary location (p = 0.0001). The 2-year EFS was only 32% after open biopsy. The 2-year EFS was 66% for favourable locations (abdominal wall, intra-abdominal, breast, digestive viscera and lower limb) and 41% for unfavourable locations. Among patients with favourable locations, the 2-year EFS was similar in patients treated by both surgery (70%) and the wait-and-see approach (63%; p = 0.413). Among patients with unfavourable locations, the 2-year EFS was significantly enhanced in patients initially managed with the wait-and-see approach (52%) compared with those who underwent initial surgery (25%; p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The location of DTF is a major prognostic factor for EFS. If these findings are confirmed by independent analysis, personalised management of DTF must consider this easily obtained parameter."
"Gastroblastoma is a rare distinctive biphasic tumor of the stomach. The molecular biology of gastroblastoma has not been studied, and no affirmative diagnostic markers have been developed. We retrieved two gastroblastomas from the consultation practices of the authors and performed transcriptome sequencing on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. Recurrent predicted fusion genes were validated at genomic and RNA levels. The presence of the fusion gene was confirmed on two additional paraffin-embedded cases of gastroblastoma. Control cases of histologic mimics (biphasic synovial sarcoma, leiomyoma, leiomyosarcoma, desmoid-type fibromatosis, EWSR1-FLI1-positive Ewing sarcoma, Wilms' tumor, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, plexiform fibromyxoma, Sonic hedgehog-type medulloblastomas, and normal gastric mucosa and muscularis propria were also analyzed. The gastroblastomas affected two males and two females aged 9-56 years. Transcriptome sequencing identified recurrent somatic MALAT1-GLI1 fusion genes, which were predicted to retain the key domains of GLI1. The MALAT1-GLI1 fusion gene was validated by break-apart and dual-fusion FISH and RT-PCR. The additional two gastroblastomas were also positive for the MALAT1-GLI1 fusion gene. None of the other control cases harbored MALAT1-GLI1. Overexpression of GLI1 in the cases of gastroblastomas was confirmed at RNA and protein levels. Pathway analysis revealed activation of the Sonic hedgehog pathway in gastroblastoma and gene expression profiling showed that gastroblastomas grouped together and were most similar to Sonic hedgehog-type medulloblastomas. In summary, we have identified an oncogenic MALAT1-GLI1 fusion gene in all cases of gastroblastoma that may serve as a diagnostic biomarker. The fusion gene is predicted to encode a protein that includes the zinc finger domains of GLI1 and results in overexpression of GLI1 protein and activation of the Sonic hedgehog pathway."

"To investigate the contribution of radiation therapy to acute and late toxicity in pediatric chest wall sarcoma patients and evaluate dosimetric correlates of higher incidence toxicities such as scoliosis and pneumonitis. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The data from 23 consecutively treated pediatric patients with chest wall sarcomas of various histologies (desmoid, Ewing, rhabdomyosarcoma, nonrhabdomyosarcoma-soft tissue sarcomas) were reviewed to evaluate the relationship between end-organ radiation dose, clinical factors, and the risk of subsequent late effects (scoliosis, pneumonitis). Cobb angles were used to quantify the extent of scoliosis. Doses to the spine and lung were calculated from the radiation treatment plan. RESULTS: The range of scoliosis identified on follow-up imaging ranged from -47.6 to 64 degrees (median, 2.95 degrees ). No relationship was identified between either radiation dose to the ipsilateral or contralateral vertebral body or tumor size and the degree or direction of scoliosis. The extent of surgical resection and number and location of resected ribs affected the extent of scoliosis. The dominant predictor of extent of scoliosis at long-term follow-up was the extent of scoliosis following surgical resection. Radiation pneumonitis was uncommon and was not correlated with mean dose or volume of lung receiving 24 Gy; however, 1 of 3 surviving patients who received whole pleural surface radiation therapy developed significant restrictive lung disease. CONCLUSIONS: Acute and late radiation therapy-associated toxicities in pediatric chest wall sarcoma patients are modest. The degree of scoliosis following resection is a function of the extent of resection and of the number and location of ribs resected, and the degree of scoliosis at the last follow-up visit is a function of the extent of scoliosis following surgery. Differential radiation therapy dose across the vertebral body does not increase the degree of scoliosis. Severe restrictive pulmonary disease is a late complication of survivors after whole pleural surface radiation therapy."
"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a cancer syndrome caused by a germline mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. It is characterized by the presence of hundreds of colonic polyps, which have a high tendency to undergo malignant transformation. Among associated lesions in FAP, desmoid tumors represent a common possible life-threatening condition that requires special attention. They are rare tumors occurring with a particularly high incidence in FAP, especially after surgery. In agreement with Knudson's 'two-hit' theory, the inactivation of the residual APC gene in FAP is a critical step in the development of both colorectal cancer and desmoids. Several lines of evidence show that germline mutations affect the functional domains of the APC gene that are responsible for interactions of the transcript with beta-catenin, whereas somatic second mutations involve the downstream region of the gene. Hence, an understanding of the molecular pathways underlying desmoid progression in FAP could be important for research and a valid resource for the early prevention and tailored treatment of this disease. In this review, we provide an updated insight into desmoids in FAP syndrome, from molecular pathogenesis to the main issues in management, with special attention given to genetic and molecular features of these tumors."
"Desmoid tumors are locally destructive but histologically benign. Their management involves close observation and surgical, medical, or hormonal treatment. PRESENTATION OF THE CASE: A 36-year-old male was admitted for abdominal pain and fever. A CT scan showed fluid collections and air within a mesenteric mass. Diagnostic laparotomy was performed with drainage of the abscess and biopsy of the mass. The pathology suggested a desmoid tumor. His fever and abdominal pain persisted. An endoscopy was performed, which demonstrated a fistula track in the third part of the duodenum. After a multidisciplinary discussion, consensus was to pursue surgical intervention. The patient underwent an en bloc resection of the tumor including a portion of the wall of the third part of the duodenum. The final pathology confirmed a desmoid tumor with a fistula track to the duodenum. The patient had a re-laparotomy on POD2 for intra-abdominal bleeding but was discharged without further events on POD7. He had no evidence of recurrence on follow-up at 11 months. DISCUSSION: Desmoid tumors are rarely complicated by abscess formation or fistulization. The management of intra-abdominal desmoids in this setting is challenging, as patients are often symptomatic and unresponsive to medical management. Percutaneous drainage and antibiotics are often initiated as first-line treatment, followed by surgery or medical therapy after evaluation of resectability and tumor stage. CONCLUSION: Rare complications can arise with intra-abdominal desmoid tumors. Principles of infection control should be applied in combination with optimization of oncologic outcome. A multidisciplinary approach helps to achieve both these objectives."

"The case of a giant thoracic desmoid tumour in a 44-year-old woman, who presented two years following a breast reconstruction with a latissimus dorsi (LD) flap and implant, is reported. Clinical findings included a rapidly growing, painless mass. Computed tomography (CT) suggested skin and intercostal soft tissue invasion. The tumour was resected en bloc with the LD muscle, implant capsule and underlying rib segments. The resultant thoracic and abdominal wall defects were reconstructed with Dualmesh(R) and polypropylene meshes respectively. There was no evidence of recurrence at thirty-six months follow-up."
"Desmoid tumors are benign tumors, yet can lead to significant morbidity due to aggressive local expansions. Treatment starts with a wait-and-see policy, however, more aggressive treatments like broad margin resection surgery might be necessary in case of tumor progression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report the case of a 26-year-old female with a symptomatic desmoid tumor in the left rectus muscle. The initial wait-and-see policy led to an increase in tumor size and progression of symptoms. Computed tomography (CT) angiography revealed a dominant arterial blood supply via a branch of the inferior epigastric artery. We then performed a super selective embolization of the dominant arterial blood supply, to avoid the need for broad margin resection. RESULTS: At three months follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no residual tumor. At nine months follow-up, MRI scan reconfirmed the successful outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Embolization of a primary supplying vessel of a desmoid tumor is a viable treatment option. However, scientific evidence remains limited and further research is mandatory for inclusion in evidence based treatment algorithms."
"We present herein a series of 14 lesions showing overlapping features with the newly defined benign cutaneous mesenchymal neoplasm labeled as fibroblastic connective tissue nevus (FCTN). METHODS AND RESULTS: Total of 8 patients were male and 5 were female, ranging in age from 1 to 56 years. Lesions appeared as isolated nodules or plaques on the trunk (7 cases), the limbs (4 cases) and the neck (2 cases). Histologically, all cases were composed of bundles of bland spindle cells of fibroblastic/myofibroblastic lineage irregularly branching within the reticular dermis and along fibrous septa in the subcutis. Adnexal structures and dermal adipocytes were entrapped by the fascicles, the epidermis was often papillomatous and elastic fibers were decreased and fragmented. Expression of CD34 and ASMA was found in 8 and 7 cases, respectively. Follow-up was available for 7 patients (mean follow-up, 5 years; range, 1-10 years). None of the cases metastasized or recurred, even when incompletely excised. CONCLUSION: The differential diagnosis of FCTN is broad and includes hypertrophic scar, dermatofibroma, dermatomyofibroma, pilar leiomyoma, plaque-stage DFSP, CD34-positive plaque-like dermal fibroma, fibroblastic-predominant plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumor, lipofibromatosis, superficial desmoid fibromatosis and fibrous hamartoma of infancy, of which it represents probably the monophasic variant."

"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is a rare mesenchymal lesion with high risk of local recurrence. Specific beta-catenin mutations (S45F) appeared to be related to this higher risk compared to T41A-mutated or wild-type (WT). We explored the influence of both mutations and WT on structure stability and affinity of beta-catenin for alpha-catenin and the pattern of gene expression that may influence DF behavior. Using 33 surgically resected primary DFs harboring T41A (n = 14), S45F (n = 10), or WT (n = 9), we performed a comparative molecular analysis by protein/protein interaction modeling, gene expression by DASL microarrays, human inflammation gene panel, and assessment of immune system-based biomarkers by immunohistochemistry. Mutated proteins were more stable than WT and formed a weaker complex with alpha-catenin. Consensus unsupervised gene clustering revealed the presence of two DF group-mutated (T41A + S45F) and WT (P = 0.0047). The gene sets 'Inflammatory-Defense-Humoral Immune Response' and 'Antigen Binding' were significantly enriched in T41A. The deregulation of 16 inflammation-related genes was confirmed. Low numbers of T cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) infiltrating the tumors and low/absent PD-1/PD-L1 expression were also identified. We demonstrated that mutated DFs (T41A or S45F) and WT are two distinct molecular subgroups with regard to beta-catenin stability, alpha-catenin affinity, and gene expression profiling. A different inflammation signature characterized the two mutated groups, suggesting mediation either by T41A or by S45F. Finally, all mutated cases showed a low number of TIL and TAM cells and a low or absent expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 consistent with beta-catenin activation insensitive to checkpoint blockade."
"Desmoid tumors are benign myofibroblastic neoplasms, originating from the muscle aponeurosis and classified as deep fibromatoses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of multi-parametric (mp)-MRI for the diagnosis of abdominal wall desmoid tumor (awdt). MATERIAL AND METHODS: This Institutional review board approved retrospective study compared 10 patients (mean age+/-SD; 38.2+/-13years; 9 females and 1 male) with awdt to 14 subjects (mean age+/-SD; 45.6+/-14.7years; 9 females and 5 males) with non-desmoid abdominal wall tumors (ndawt). All included subjects underwent mp-MRI, which included conventional, diffusion weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI. Two blinded experienced fellowship trained radiologists (MK and SR) evaluated each lesion characteristics qualitatively and quantitatively which included margin, homogeneity, T2W/T1W signal intensity (SI), T2 dark strands, and fascial tail together with measurements of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and semi-quantitative DCE analysis. Inter-observer agreement was assessed using Cohen's kappa and data were compared between groups using independent sample t-tests and Chi-square tests. RESULTS: No significant differences in age or gender appeared between groups. On qualitative analysis, T2 dark strands were identified in 90% by both radiologist (K=0.82) of awdt, while fascial tail was identified in 70% by radiologist 1 and 80% by second radiologist (k=0.91) of awdt; however no other lesions showed these findings. Other subjective imaging findings did not significantly differ between groups with moderate-to-strong agreements (k=0.7-1.0). On quantitative measurements, diffusion imaging awdt lesions showed higher mean ADC value compared to other lesions, although it did not reached at the level of significance. While on DCE MRI, all awdt lesions showed type 1 (progressive) DCE curve, however no significant difference was observed between groups. CONCLUSIONS: T2 dark strands and fascial tail are characteristic features of awdt, whereas other subjective/qualitative findings are not useful. Quantitative findings such as ADC measurements and DCE curve analysis may have additional value to differentiate awdt from ndawt, but will require further analysis."
"This study investigates the feasibility of non-invasively determining thermal diffusivity (alpha) and the Pennes perfusion parameter (w) from pre-clinical and clinical magnetic resonance-guided focussed ultrasound (MRgFUS) temperature data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pre-clinical MRgFUS experiments were performed in rabbit muscle (N = 3, 28 sonications) using three-dimensional MR thermometry. Eight sonications were made in a clinical QA phantom with two-dimensional thermometry. Retrospective property determination was performed on clinical uterine fibroid (N = 8, 9 sonications) and desmoid tumour (N = 4, 7 sonications) data. The property determination method fits an analytical solution to MRgFUS temperatures in the coronal MR plane, including all temperatures acquired during heating and one cooling image. When possible, additional cooling data were acquired for property determination. RESULTS: Rabbit alpha and w from Heating Data (alpha = 0.164 mm(2)s(-1), w = 7.9 kg m(-3 )s(-1)) and Heating and Cooling Data (alpha = 0.146 mm(2)s(-1), w = 3.3 kg m(-3 )s(-1)) were within the range of gold-standard invasive measurements, with >50% reduction in variability by including cooling data. QA phantom property determination with cooling data yielded properties within 3% of expected values (alpha = 0.144 mm(2)s(-1), w = 0.0 kg m(-3 )s(-1)), a difference that was not statistically significant (p = 0.053). Uterine fibroid (Heating Data: alpha = 0.212 mm(2)s(-1), w = 11.0 kg m(-3 )s(-1)) and desmoid tumour (Heating & Cooling Data: alpha = 0.245 mm(2)s(-1), w = 4.7 kg m(-3 )s(-1)) properties are feasible but lack independent verification. CONCLUSIONS: Thermal diffusivity and the Pennes perfusion parameter can be obtained from in vivo data and with clinical MRgFUS protocols. Property values are consistently improved by including cooling data. The utility of this property determination method will increase as clinical protocols implement improved temperature imaging."
"Desmoid tumor (DT) is a locally invasive form of fibromatosis, comprising only 0.03% of all tumors. DTs occur more frequently in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and Gardner's syndrome, as intra-abdominal or anterior abdominal wall tumors, whereas sporadic DTs are more likely to be extra-abdominal (only 5% of sporadic DTs are intra-abdominal). There is also an association of DTs with prior trauma, surgery, estrogen exposure and childbirth. Imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used for preoperative diagnosis and for the planning of the surgery. Following surgery, CT and MRI are used to detect recurrence and to monitor the tumor's response to radiotherapy or medical therapy for unresectable or recurrent tumors. We herein report a rare case of a sporadic giant intra-abdominal DT in a 28-year-old female patient without any predisposing factors, and highlight the importance of including DT in the differential diagnosis of huge intra-abdominal masses."
"Desmoid tumor of rectus abdominis presenting with Grey-Turner's and Cullen's sign is rare. Herein, we report desmoid tumor of rectus abdominis in a 64-year-old multiparous female who presented with ecchymosis involving left flank and around the umbilicus. Histopathological examination of biopsy from the tumor confirmed the diagnosis of the desmoid tumor. She was referred to a surgeon for radical resection."
"Aggressive fibromatosis, also known as desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) or desmoid tumor, is an uncommon locally invasive tumor. Because of its low incidence and variable behavior, DTF is often first seen by physicians who are not familiar with it, and recent advances in understanding this disease have led to changes in treatment approaches. The Wnt (beta-catenin) pathway appears to play a key role in DTF pathogenesis, and recent studies of DTF biology suggest a possible model of DTF pathogenesis. Histologically, DTF shows a poorly circumscribed proliferation of myofibroblast-like cells with variable collagen deposition, similar to the proliferative phase of wound healing, and DTF has been associated with trauma and pregnancy. Desmoid-type fibromatosis may be a useful model of the tumor stroma in carcinomas as well as other fibrosing diseases such as progressive pulmonary fibrosis. The clinical course of DTF can vary greatly among patients, complicating the determination of the optimal treatment approach. Treatment options include surgery, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with or without hormonal manipulation, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and other forms of local therapy. Many treatments have been used, but these are not without toxicities. Because of the variable nature of the disease and the potential morbidity of treatment, some cases of DTF may do better without treatment; simple observation is often the best initial treatment. This review used a PubMed search from January 1, 1980, through October 31, 2016, using the terms fibromatosis and desmoid and discusses DTF disease characteristics, pathophysiology, and treatment options as well as examines several cases illustrating key points in the biology and treatment of this heterogeneous disease."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a rare disease of which 7.5-16% have been reported to be related to familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). We sought to compare the characteristics and treatment of sporadic and FAP-related desmoid-type fibromatoses. METHODS: Altogether 220 patients were included in the study after receiving a diagnosis of desmoid-type fibromatosis by the Pathology Department of Helsinki University Hospital, with adequate follow-up. Patients were included from January 1, 1980 until April 30, 2015. RESULTS: FAP-related tumors were found in 22 (10%) patients. FAP-related desmoid-type fibromatoses were larger, more commonly multiple, and more often intra-abdominally situated. Surgery was the treatment of choice for 179 (90%) of the sporadic patients and for 18 (82%) of FAP-related patients. Resections with non-involved margins (R0) were more common in sporadic desmoid-type fibromatoses (55% vs. 23%, P = 0.048). The risk of recurrence was 25% in sporadic- and 44% in the FAP-related group. Three (14%) patients with FAP-related desmoid-type fibromatoses died from the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The predictors for FAP occurrence among desmoid tumor patients are large tumor size, intra-abdominal location, multiple tumors, and patient's young age. Desmoid-type fibromatosis patients suffer a high recurrence rate, also among those experiencing sporadic tumors, but the risk of death due to the tumor is low. Conversely, desmoid disease represents a substantial cause of death among FAP patients."
"Chest desmoid tumors (CDT) are rare lesions characterized by fibroblastic proliferation from the connective tissue. Although CDT have been studied previously, no cases following subfascial transaxillary breast augmentation (TBA) have been described. PRESENTATION OF CASE: The authors describe a case of CDT in a 28-year-old woman one year after TBA, which presented as a painful and progressive mass in the lower-inner right breast quadrant. MRI showed a soft-tissue tumor (6x3x4cm) that affected the region of the right anterior costal margin, without signs of structural costal invasion. Patient was treated surgically, exposing the right costal-sternal region through an inframammary approach and resecting the CDT. The remaining capsular flap was mobilized into the defect and a form-stable silicone implant was utilized to cover the chest wall defect and achieve an adequate breast contour. The patient is currently in 5th year after chest reconstruction, with satisfactory results. Neither the tumor or the symptoms recurred. DISCUSSION: CDT is an uncommon evolution following TBA. Although it is a rare disease, thoracic and plastic surgeons must be alert to avoid misdiagnosis. Defect reconstruction is necessary, mobilizing the capsular flaps and replacing the implants in order to obtain a satisfactory outcome. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of this rare post-operative evolution is crucial, and early surgical intervention is warranted in order to avoid more aggressive treatment. This case report provides general knowledge of CDT, and may be used as guidance for early diagnosis and treatment."

"A 45-year-old woman was found to have a pancreatic tumor by abdominal ultrasound performed for a medical check-up. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a hypovascular tumor measuring 30 mm in diameter in the pancreatic tail. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration was performed. An extragastric growing gastrointestinal stromal tumor was thereby diagnosed preoperatively, and surgical resection was planned. Laparoscopic surgery was attempted but conversion to open surgery was necessitated by extensive adhesions, and distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, and partial gastrectomy were performed. The histological diagnosis was an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor. A desmoid tumor is a fibrous soft tissue tumor arising in the fascia and musculoaponeurotic tissues. It usually occurs in the extremities and abdominal wall, and only rarely in the abdominal cavity. We experienced a case with an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor that was histologically diagnosed after laparotomy, which had been preoperatively diagnosed as an extragastric growing gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Although rare, desmoid tumors should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intra-abdominal tumors. Herein, we report this case with a literature review."
"Soft-tissue sarcomas occurring in the abdomen and pelvis are an uncommon but important group of malignancies. Recent changes to the World Health Organization classification of soft-tissue tumors include the movement of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) into the soft-tissue tumor classification. GIST is the most common intraperitoneal sarcoma. Liposarcoma is the most common retroperitoneal sarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma is the second most common. GIST, liposarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma account for the majority of sarcomas encountered in the abdomen and pelvis and are discussed in part 1 of this article. Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (previously called malignant fibrous histiocytoma), dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, solitary fibrous tumor, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, extraskeletal chondro-osseous sarcomas, vascular sarcomas, and sarcomas of uncertain differentiation uncommonly arise in the abdomen and pelvis and the abdominal wall. Although these lesions are rare sarcomas and their imaging features overlap, familiarity with the locations where they occur and their imaging features is important so they can be diagnosed accurately. The anatomic location and clinical history are important factors in the differential diagnosis of these lesions because metastasis, more-common sarcomas, borderline fibroblastic proliferations (such as desmoid tumors), and endometriosis have imaging findings that overlap with those of these uncommon sarcomas. In this article, the clinical, pathologic, and imaging findings of uncommon soft-tissue sarcomas of the abdomen and pelvis and the abdominal wall are reviewed, with an emphasis on their differential diagnosis."
"To summarize the current knowledge about the biology and clinical management of adult desmoid tumors. RECENT FINDINGS: In the past decade, we have learned that desmoid tumors are driven by alterations of the Wnt/APC/beta-catenin pathway, sporadic desmoid tumors are associated with somatic mutations of CTNNB1, and germline mutations of APC and somatic mutations of CTNNB1 are probably mutually exclusive. One-third of desmoid tumors are misdiagnosed; a second pathological opinion is therefore of major importance for desmoid tumor. Surgery is no longer regarded as the cornerstone of desmoid tumors; several retrospective studies have demonstrated the safety of a 'wait and see' policy in sporadic abdominal wall desmoid tumor. Desmoid tumors is no longer regarded as an absolute contraindication for pregnancy. At least two new investigational drugs targeting the Wnt/APC/beta-catenin pathway are currently being developed. SUMMARY: The management of desmoid tumors requires multidisciplinary expertise by an experienced team. We must fully understand the physiopathology of the disease (factors influencing the natural history of the disease) and learn how to avoid desmoid tumors occurrence in patients with APC germline mutations, identify reliable prognostic/predictive factors and better assess the efficacy of systemic treatment."

"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a sarcoma subtype that gathers some singular characteristics, making it a difficult challenge to face in clinical practice. Despite its excellent survival prognosis, these tumors may be unpredictable, ranging from an asymptomatic indolent course to persistent, local, and extended recurrences that significantly impair quality of life. Although surgery was initially considered the first elective treatment, collected published data during the past few years are now pointing to the ""wait and see"" approach as a reasonable initial strategy because many patients can live a long life with the disease without having symptoms. When symptoms appear or there is a risk of functional impairment, a wide spectrum of therapies (local and systemic) can be useful in improving symptoms and controlling the disease. Because of the low incidence of desmoid-type fibromatosis, there is scarce scientific evidence supporting any specific treatment. Nonetheless, if volumetric responses are needed, chemotherapy may be a reasonable early option. However, if long-term control of disease is desirable, hormonal therapy, NSAIDs, and TKIs are the likely treatments of choice. Recent new findings in the biologic development of these tumors, such as the role of Wnt/beta-catenin dependent pathway, have shown that the prognostic information provided by specific CTNNB1 gene mutations and other genetic profiles can lead to better methods of selecting patients as candidates for other approaches. Based on recent research, the Notch pathway inhibition in DF is one of the most promising potential targets to explore. As an orphan disease, it is mandatory that as many patients as possible be included in clinical trials."
"Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors, particularly those derived from the stomach, are rare. Such tumors are associated with a history of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), trauma, or surgical procedures in general. In addition, spontaneous shrinking of an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor is rarer. And desmoid tumors most commonly arise during the fourth decade of life. CASE PRESENTATION: A 17-year-old boy with lower abdominal pain was diagnosed with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) or a hematoma at a local hospital. He had no history of FAP, trauma, or previous surgery. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) was performed for observational purposes three times over a 9-month period. The tumor gradually decreased in size over time; however, the tumor did not shrink sufficiently to be diagnosed as a hematoma. Because there was a high possibility of a GIST from the stomach, he underwent laparotomy. Operative findings revealed that the tumor was a hard mass firmly attached to both the greater curvature of the stomach and the inferior pole of the spleen. Pathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as a desmoid tumor derived from the stomach. CONCLUSION: For a young boy without a history of FAP, trauma, or surgical procedures, it is difficult to define an intra-abdominal tumor near the stomach as a desmoid tumor. In such cases, surgical resection is recommended for a definitive diagnosis."
"Breast fibromatosis is a rare disease characterized by monoclonal fibroblast proliferation. It has no ability to metastasize but has a high local recurrence rate and often infiltrates surrounding tissues. Surgical treatment is the reference, but recently, new targeted therapies have emerged. We report an original case of a patient with breast fibromatosis who received exclusive medical treatment. Our aim was to analyze these treatments based on the clinical and radiological outcome, iatrogenic effects, and pharmacological action. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 19-year-old woman who developed a desmoid-type fibromatosis of the lower inner quadrant of the right breast, measuring 50 x 25 mm (i.e., a volume of 27.4 cm(3)). Initial surgery was not possible because of potential esthetic and functional prejudice. Thus, she had an exclusive medical treatment including several lines: NSAIDs with tamoxifen and triptorelin, followed by sorafenib, then interferon alpha2b, and finally sunitinib. With tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (sunitinib), a significant partial response was observed (57% reduction of the maximal tumoral volume). For each treatment, we provided the clinical and radiological outcome in association with known pharmacological action. CONCLUSIONS: TKI had been an interesting alternative option to initial surgery, providing at least a partial response and potentially allowing less mutilating surgery. However, no pharmacological mechanism can unequivocally explain TKI efficacy. In general, breast fibromatosis should be treated along with oncologist and interventional radiologists in a trans-disciplinary modality, thus offering an adapted treatment for this particular desmoid-type fibromatosis localization."
"Desmoid tumors (DT) are rare, benign, fibroblastic neoplasm with challenging histological diagnosis. DTs can occur sporadically or associated with the familial adenomatous polyposis coli (FAP). Most sporadic DTs are associated with beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1) mutations, while mutated APC gene causes FAP disease. microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in many human carcinogenesis.The miRNA profile was analyzed by microarray in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens of 12 patients (8 sporadic, 4 FAP-associated) and 4 healthy controls. One hundred and one mRNAs resulted dysregulated, of which 98 in sporadic DTs and 8 in FAP-associated DTs, 5 were shared by both tumors. Twenty-six miRNAs were then validated by RT-qPCR in 23 sporadic and 7 FAP-associated DT samples matched with healthy controls. The qPCR method was also used to evaluate the CTNNB1 mutational status in sporadic DTs. The correlation between sporadic DTs and miRNA expression showed that miR-21-3p increased in mutated versus wild-type DTs, while miR-197-3p was decreased. The mRNA expression of Tetraspanin3 and Serpin family A member 3, as miR-21-3p targets, and L1 Cell Adhesion Molecule, as miR-197-3p target, was also evaluate. CTNNB1 mutations associated to miRNA dysregulation could affect the genesis and the progression of this disease and help histological diagnosis of sporadic DTs."
"Patients with Down syndrome (DS) have a markedly higher incidence of childhood leukemia, but a lower incidence of most solid tumors, compared with age-matched euploid individuals. Trisomy 21 might be protective against tumorigenesis because of several tumor suppressive mechanisms. Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is a rare monoclonal, fibroblastic proliferation characterized by a variable clinical course. In recent reports, almost all cases of DF involved genomic alterations associated with activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Here, we report the case of a boy with DS who developed DF without activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of DS involving DF."
"Desmoid tumor is a rare monoclonal fibroblast proliferation that is regarded as benign. The clinical management of desmoid tumors is very complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach because of the unpredictable disease course. For those cases localized in the anterior abdominal wall, symptomatic and unresponsive to medical treatment, radical resection and reconstruction with a prosthetic device are indicated. We present here a case of desmoid fibromatosis of the left anterolateral abdominal wall with a marked increase of the mass that required a large excision followed by reconstruction with biological matrix. The fact that it can be incorporated in patient tissue without a fibrotic response and that it can resist future infections, together with a very competetive price, made the new collagen matrix Egis((R)) our first choice."

"Today, surgery and radiation therapy have a limited role in desmoid-type fibromatosis. Different systemic treatments were shown to be effective. Herein, we report on our institutional experience with low-dose methotrexate (MTX) + vinca alkaloids in this disease over the last 25 years. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from all adult patients with sporadic desmoid-type fibromatosis treated with MTX and vinca alkaloids at our institution between 1989 and 2014. RESULTS: We identified 75 patients treated with MTX + vinblastine (40%), MTX + vinorelbine (57%), and vinorelbine alone (3%). All patients had progressive disease before chemotherapy; 72%, 10%, and 48% of patients had received previous surgery, radiation therapy, and/or systemic treatments, respectively. Chemotherapy was administered for a median duration of 14 months and a median number of 37.5 cycles. Eight patients interrupted chemotherapy because of toxicity. According to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease were observed in 1%, 47%, 51%, and 1% of patients, respectively. Symptomatic relief was obtained in 80% of symptomatic cases. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 75 months; it was 136 months in responding patients. Upon progression, after chemotherapy withdrawal, MTX plus vinblastine/vinorelbine was offered to 11 patients with partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease in 4, 6, and 1 cases, resulting in a median PFS of 53 months. CONCLUSIONS: In this series, chemotherapy with MTX and vinca alkaloids is confirmed to be active and effective, with a remarkable PFS, higher in responding patients, and limited toxicity. Even progression can be successfully rechallenged."
"Cortical desmoids are self-limiting fibro-osseous lesions commonly occurring at the medial supracondylar femur in active adolescents, at either the origin of the medial head of the gastrocnemius or at the insertion of the adductor magnus aponeurosis. Less commonly, in a similar demographic, cortical desmoids may occur in the proximal humerus medially at the insertion of the pectoralis major muscle or laterally at the insertion of the deltoid. The radiographic appearance of the proximal humerus cortical desmoid has been described previously, but not the MRI appearance. We present the radiographic and MRI appearances of a proximal humerus cortical desmoid in a young adolescent who presented for investigation of right shoulder pain."
"Purpose Desmoid tumors (aggressive fibromatosis) arise from connective tissue cells or fibroblasts. In general, they are slow growing and do not metastasize; however, locally aggressive desmoid tumors can cause severe morbidity and loss of function. Disease recurrence after surgery and/or radiation and diagnosis of multifocal desmoid tumors highlight the need to develop effective systemic treatments for this disease. In this study, we evaluate objective response rate after therapy with the gamma-secretase inhibitor PF-03084014 in patients with recurrent, refractory, progressive desmoid tumors. Patients and Methods Seventeen patients with desmoid tumors received PF-03084014 150 mg orally twice a day in 3-week cycles. Response to treatment was evaluated at cycle 1 and every six cycles, that is, 18 weeks, by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) version 1.1. Patient-reported outcomes were measured at baseline and at every restaging visit by using the MD Anderson Symptoms Inventory. Archival tumor and blood samples were genotyped for somatic and germline mutations in APC and CTNNB1. Results Of 17 patients accrued to the study, 15 had mutations in APC or CTNNB1 genes. Sixteen patients (94%) were evaluable for response; five (29%) experienced a confirmed partial response and have been on study for more than 2 years. Another five patients with prolonged stable disease as their best response remain on study. Patient-reported outcomes confirmed clinician reporting that the investigational agent was well tolerated and, in subgroup analyses, participants who demonstrated partial response also experienced clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in symptom burden. Conclusion PF-03084014 was well tolerated and demonstrated promising clinical benefit in patients with refractory, progressive desmoid tumors who receive long-term treatment."
"Plantar fibromatosis is a rare, benign fibroproliferative disorder of the plantar fascia. It is considered as a low-grade tumour and it can be locally aggressive. It can present as painful swelling with impairment of local function. Upon failure of non-operative management, surgical treatment options include total fasciectomy or partial fasciectomy. Although surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment, recurrence rate can be up to 60%. The aim of this study was to determine the recurrence and complication rates of surgically treated plantar fibromatosis. A retrospective study was conducted involving patients who had a confirmed diagnosis and excision of plantar fibromatosis treated in our institution between 2011 and 2016. Demographic data, follow-up duration, recurrence and complications were reviewed. Eighteen patients underwent 19 operations. Mean age was 41.3 years (20-57). There were 12 male patients. The main presenting features were pain, swelling and impairment of function. They were investigated by ultrasound scan (12 feet, 63%) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (8 feet, 42%). Two patients (11%) had prior surgery at other institutions whilst 3 patients (17%) had multiple nodules at presentation. All patients underwent partial fasciectomy of the plantar fibromatosis. At up to 5 years follow-up, one patient (6%) had a recurrence in our series whilst 3 patients (17%) had scar related problems (2 patients with scar pain and one patient had hypersensitive scar that resolved after 12 months). Symptomatic plantar fibromatosis can be effectively treated with partial plantar fasciectomy."

"Abdominal wall desmoid type fibromatosis management has been changing over recent years, from an aggressive approach towards a more conservative one. When radical resection is indicated, the surgical team faces the challenge of abdominal wall reconstruction, for which optimal technique is still debated. The present study reports the experience from a single center with abdominal closures after desmoid type fibromatosis resection. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients who underwent abdominal wall closure after sporadic abdominal desmoid type fibromatosis radical resection from 1982 to 2013. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were included, mean tumor diameter was 10 + 5.3 cm, and the main choice of abdominal wall reconstruction was midline closure with anterior rectus sheath relaxing incisions and polypropylene onlay mesh (74% of the cases). Only 7% of the cases required more complex procedures for skin closure. Mean follow-up was 5 years and 89% remained disease-free. No grade 4 or 5 complications were observed. CONCLUSION: High midline fascial closure rate can be achieved after resection of abdominal wall desmoid tumor using relaxing incisions and mesh, with low complication rate."
"The consequences of patient identification errors due to specimen mislabeling can be deleterious. We describe two near-miss events involving mislabeled breast specimens from two patients who sought treatment at our institution. In both cases, microscopic review of the slides identified inconsistencies between the histologic findings and patient age, unveiling specimen identification errors. By correlating the clinical information with the microscopic findings, we identified mistakes that had occurred at the time of specimen accessioning at the original laboratories. In both cases, thanks to a timely reassignment of the specimens, the patients suffered no harm. These cases highlight the importance of routine clinical and pathologic correlation as a critical component of quality assurance and patient safety. A review of possible specimen identification errors in the anatomic pathology setting is presented."
"Desmoids tumors, characterized by monoclonal proliferation of myofibroblasts, could occur in 5-10% of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) as an extra-colonic manifestation of the disease. FAP can develop when there is a germ-line mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene. Although mild or attenuated FAP may follow mutations in 5 extreme of the gene, it is more likely that 3 extreme mutations haveamore severe manifestation of thedisease. A 28-year-old woman was admitted to the Cancer Institute of Iran with an abdominal painful mass. She had strong family history of FAP and underwent prophylactic total colectomy. Pre-operative CT scans revealed a large mass. Microscopic observation showed diffuse fibroblast cell infiltration of the adjacent tissue structures. Peripheral blood DNA extraction followed by adenomatous polyposis coli gene exon by exon sequencing was performed to investigate the mutation in adenomatous polyposis coli gene. Analysis of DNA sequencing demonstrated a mutation of 4 bpdeletions at codon 1309-1310 of the exon 16 of adenomatous polyposis coli gene sequence which was repeated in 3 members of the family. Some of them had desmoid tumor without classical FAP history. Even when there is no familial history of adenomatous polyposis, the adenomatous polyposis coli gene mutation should be investigated in cases of familial desmoids tumors for a suitable prevention. The 3 extreme of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene is still the best likely location in such families."
"Desmoid tumours describe a rare monoclonal, fibroblastic proliferation characterised by an often unpredictable clinical course. Surgery is one therapeutic option for progressing patients, except if mutilating and associated with considerable function loss. Different systemic treatment approaches have been investigated and promising results could be demonstrated using imatinib. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We initiated a phase II trial within the German Interdisciplinary Sarcoma Group (GISG) evaluating imatinib to induce progression arrest in desmoid tumour patients being Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) progressive, not amenable to surgical resection with R0 intent or accompanied by unacceptable function loss (NCT01137916). Thirty-eight patients (median age 44 years [range: 19-80]; 68% female; 90% Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0) were treated with a daily dose of 800 mg imatinib planned over 2 years. The progression arrest rate after 6 months of imatinib treatment (PAR6mo) was the primary end-point. Patients showing disease progression under imatinib could be treated with nilotinib 800 mg daily. Accrual started in July 2010 in four GISG centres and finalised in September 2013. RESULTS: The final analysis for the primary end-point in the evaluable patients of the full analysis set revealed a PAR6mo of 65%. Subsequent progression arrest rates at 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 months were 65%, 59%, 53%, 53%, 50% and 45%, respectively. None of the patients died within the study observational period. Best reported response was seven partial responses at 21 months revealing an overall response rate of 19%. Eight patients treated with nilotinib demonstrated a PAR at 3 months of 88% (7/8); no more disease progressions occurred until end of study. In general imatinib adverse events were mild to moderate. CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib induces sustained progression arrest in RECIST progressive desmoid tumour patients. In addition, nilotinib had the potential to stabilise desmoid tumour growth after treatment failure with imatinib."
"This study describes a case report of a 31-year-old patient who presented with a left thoracic tumor on costal cartilages 5 and 6 that was diagnosed as a desmoid tumor 3 years after receiving retropectoral breast implants for cosmetic reasons. The integral reconstruction of the thoracic wall, functional and aesthetic, was planned for a single surgical period. The defect secondary to the tumor resection, which left the pericardium and lung exposed, was closed using the pectoral muscle as a ""pre-expanded"" flap by the breast implant, and the breast aesthetic was treated bilaterally with new implants in the retromammary position. After 12 months, the patient remained free from tumor recurrence and had a satisfactory aesthetic result."
"To describe the clinical, imaging, and histopathological features of fibrous hamartoma of infancy (FHI) in the eyelid, a rare differential diagnosis for eyelid lesions. METHODS: We describe the case of a 7-month-old patient with a FHI in the eyelid that was diagnosed after surgical removal. The unique histopathological appearance of the triphasic histologic components provided the diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: FHI is included in the long list of differential diagnosis for eyelid lesions in infancy. Therefore, it is important for the ophthalmologists to be familiar with this entity in order to avoid misdiagnosis of other fibromatosis and malignant tumor as well as unnecessary aggressive treatment."
"11/21 (52%) in the distal and 10/21 (48%) proximal stomach, whereas 5/8 (63%) cancers were located proximally. An association between gastric tumour and desmoid development was observed; 7/8 (88%) cancer and 11/21 (52%) adenoma cases had a personal or family history of desmoid. It would appear from this small, retrospective study that gastric cancer is not a prominent extra-colonic feature of FAP in the Western world. It seems to present at an advanced stage with a poor prognosis. There may be an association between gastric tumour and desmoid occurrence but a large multicentre cohort is necessary to investigate this further."
"Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis require surgical intervention at some point in their lives. The diagnosis is often apparent from their phenotype and family history, however, this is not always the case. Many factors can influence the surgical strategy although the polyposis burden and distribution remain the main consideration. While prophylactic removal of the rectum and colon is often required, sparing the rectum at the index surgery is safe in select patients. This article aims to dispel misconceptions in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis."
"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)-associated desmoid tumor (DT) is sometimes life threatening. However, the optimal treatment for DTs has not been established. The aim of this study was to analyze the outcomes of surgical and pharmacological treatments for DT in Japanese FAP patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of 303 patients who underwent colectomy for FAP between 2000 and 2012. We analyzed 41 patients with DTs in which the location was apparent. The selection of treatment for intra-abdominal DTs was also evaluated according to Church's classification. RESULTS: Surgery was frequently used to treat extra-abdominal DTs. Multimodal treatments, including surgery, and the administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy were widely used for intra-abdominal DTs. The most effective pharmacological treatment was cytotoxic chemotherapy, which was associated with a response rate of 45.5% and a disease control rate of 72.7%. After a median follow-up period of 53.0 months, the 5-year DT-specific survival rate in patients with stage IV disease was 71.4%; in contrast, the rate in patients with other stages was 100%. Four-stage IV patients died of DT due to uncontrollable rapid progression. No cytotoxic chemotherapy was administered; however, incomplete resection was performed in three cases. CONCLUSION: Our findings will provide clues that may help physicians in selecting the optimal strategy for this rare disease."
"We herein report the case of a rapidly progressive sporadic mesenteric desmoid tumor (DT). A 62-year-old woman presented with a 4-cm-diameter palpable mass in the left supraumbilical area. The mass showed an ill-defined margin with heterogeneous delayed enhancement on computed tomography and heterogeneous high intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Sixteen months after the initial observation, the mass had grown in size, reaching 13 cm in diameter. The resected mass was histologically confirmed as a DT of the mesentery. Since DT often has an unpredictable clinical course, clinicians should bear in mind the need for imaging follow-up."
"Cellular myofibroblastic tumors other than desmoid-type fibromatosis are often diagnostically challenging due to their relative rarity, lack of known genetic abnormalities, and expression of muscle markers which may be confused with sarcomas with myogenic differentiation. In this study we investigate the molecular alterations of a group of cellular myofibroblastic lesions with in the myofibroma and myopericytoma spectrum for better subclassification. Two index cases were studied by paired-end RNA sequencing for potential fusion gene discovery. One chest wall soft tissue tumor in a 3-month-old girl case showed a SRF-C3orf62 fusion, while the other, a forearm lesion in an 8-year-old girl, showed a SRF-RELA fusion. Further screening of 42 cellular examples of myofibroma/myopericytoma by fluorescence in situ hybridization identified additional 8 cases with recurrent SRF gene rearrangements, 6 of them showing identical SRF-RELA fusions. The cohort was composed of 7 females and 3 males, with a wide age range of 3 months to 63 years (mean=17). All tumors showed a densely packed growth of oval to spindle cells with fibrillary eosinophilic cytoplasm, arranged either in intersecting fascicles or with a distinct nested pattern around a rich vascular network. Despite the dense cellularity and variable mitotic activity none of the lesions displayed nuclear pleomorphism or necrosis. All tumors showed coexpression for SMA and desmin, in most cases with a strong and diffuse pattern of staining, while myogenin was consistently negative. No distant metastases were seen in the few cases with follow-up information. A control group of 34 well-characterized myofibroblastic and perivascular tumors, including 10 typical myofibromas and 3 myopericytomas, were also investigated for SRF gene abnormalities by fluorescence in situ hybridization and were negative. In summary, we report a subset of cellular variants of myofibroma and myopericytoma showing a smooth muscle-like immunophenotype and harboring recurrent SRF-RELA gene fusions, which mimic sarcomas with myogenic differentiation."
"To evaluate the clinical, radiological and histological factors that can predict local recurrence of fibromatosis. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 51 patients diagnosed with fibromatosis in this hospital from 1983 to 2014. The mean follow-up was 83 months. A study was made of the clinical parameters, location, depth, size, surgical margins, and proliferation index (Ki-67). An evaluation was also made of the risk of recurrence depending on the adjuvant treatment and the relationship between treatment and patient functionality. RESULTS: Tumour location and depth were identified as risk factors for local recurrence, showing statistically significant differences (P<.001 and P=.003, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences in age, gender, size, surgical margins, or adjuvant treatments, or in the Musculoskeletal Tumour Society Score according to the treatment received. The mean Ki-67 was 1.9% (range 1-4), and its value was not associated with the risk of recurrence. DISCUSSION: Deep fibromatosis fascia tumours, and those located in extremities are more aggressive than superficial tumours and those located in trunk. The Ki-67 has no predictive value in local recurrence of fibromatosis. Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or other adjuvant treatments such as tamoxifen have not been effective in local control of the disease. Given the high recurrence rate, even with adequate margins, a wait and see attitude should be considered in asymptomatic patients and/or stable disease."

"Desmoid tumors are fibroblastic connective tissue tumors that most commonly develop within the anterior abdominal wall. The etiology of desmoid tumors has not been well defined; however, hereditary, hormonal, traumatic, and surgery-related causes have been implicated. Desmoid tumors are believed to arise from musculoaponeurotic structures. Development in the breast is very rare. Several reports of desmoid tumors arising in the vicinity of the fibrous capsule of a breast implant have been described, but to date, the authors are not aware of any published cases following autologous breast reconstruction. This report describes a desmoid tumor developing after a muscle-sparing free transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap for breast reconstruction and subsequent surgical management."
"We present our long experience with desmoid tumors in children. METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from 17 children/adolescents treated for sporadic desmoid tumors at a tertiary pediatric hospital in 1988-2016. There were 10 girls and 7 boys aged 1-17years. Tumor sites included head and neck, trunk, extremity, and groin. Eight patients underwent radical resection, with complete remission in 7 and local relapse in one which was treated with chemotherapy. Four patients underwent incomplete surgical resection, three with adjuvant chemotherapy. Five patients underwent biopsy only and chemotherapy. Two of the 9 chemotherapy-treated patients also had intraarterial chemoembolization. Chemotherapy usually consisted of vincristine and actinomycin-D with or without cyclophosphamide or low-dose vinblastine and methotrexate. Two patients also received tamoxifen. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 3.3years, 10 patients were alive in complete remission, 5 had stable disease, and 2 had reduced tumor size. Five-year overall survival was 100%, and event-free survival, 87.5%. Ten were screened for CTNNB1 mutations. CTNNB1 gene sequencing yielded mutations in 5/10 samples tested: 3 T41A, 2 S45F. There was no association of CTNNB1 mutation with clinical outcome or prognosis. CONCLUSION: Pediatric desmoid tumors are rare, with variable biologic behavior and morbidity. Treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: LEVEL IV, treatment study."
"Extra-abdominal desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is a rare, locally aggressive neoplasm that is usually managed conservatively. When treatment is indicated, it typically involves surgical resection, possibly with adjuvant radiotherapy. The indications for postoperative radiotherapy and its effectiveness are unclear. The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of surgical resection margins and adjuvant radiotherapy on rates of recurrence of DF. METHODS: Literature published between 1999 and 2015 was extracted from MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Registry of Trials, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Recurrence rate was analysed by meta-analysis and compared between subgroups. RESULTS: Sixteen reports were included, consisting of a total of 1295 patients with DF. In patients treated by surgical resection alone, the risk of local recurrence was almost twofold higher for those with microscopically positive resection margins (risk ratio (RR) 1.78, 95 per cent c.i. 1.40 to 2.26). Adjuvant radiotherapy after surgery with negative margins had no detectable benefit on recurrence. In contrast, after incomplete surgical resection, adjuvant radiotherapy improved recurrence rates both in patients with primary tumours (RR 1.54, 1.05 to 2.27) and in those with recurrent DF (RR 1.60, 1.12 to 2.28). CONCLUSION: DF resected with microscopically positive margins has a higher risk of recurrence. Adjuvant radiotherapy appears to reduce the risk of recurrence after incomplete surgical resection, particularly in patients with recurrent tumours."
"Desmoid tumors are benign but locally aggressive non-malignant tumors derived from fibroblasts. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy have been the mainstay of treatment, but recurrence is common and side effects can result in significant morbidity. In this case series, we highlight our experiences performing treatments in the thigh, including strategies for optimizing ablation size and safety. CASE PRESENTATION: Since December 2014, 14 magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) treatments for desmoid tumors were performed at our institution in seven patients. Nine of these treatments were completed in three patients with large tumors within the posterior thigh. The first was a 7-year-old boy who had previously been treated with surgical resection, intra-operative radiation, along with courses of vinblastine/methotrexate and sorafenib. Pretreatment tumor volume was 770 cm(3) with 75% non-enhancing volume following the initial treatment. The first treatment was complicated by a third-degree far-field skin burn. Enhanced safety measures were developed to protect the far-field skin. The patient had four subsequent treatments over 14 months, without complication, with non-perfused volume of 85% on current imaging. The second patient was a 21-year-old woman who had previously taken sulindac and celecoxib but had no other therapy. Pretreatment tumor volume was 740 cm(3). The lateral decubitus position was used to minimize the amount of energy through the sciatic nerve. The first treatment resulted in a relatively low non-perfused volume of 30%. A follow-up treatment resulted in 75-80% ablation of the target. The third patient was a 14-year-old girl with no prior treatment. Pretreatment tumor volume was approximately 440 cm(3). The sciatic nerve was encased by the anteromedial portion of the mass. A lateral decubitus position and enhanced safety measures were again used. The first treatment resulted in a relatively low non-perfused volume of 30%, likely related to low energies. The second treatment resulted in 70-80% ablation. CONCLUSIONS: MRgFUS is an effective treatment for desmoid tumors of the thigh with a favorable side effect profile, allowing for repeated treatments if necessary. Ablation size and safety can be improved with far-field coupling devices, careful patient positioning, and optimized sonication planning."
"Plantar fibromatosis is a rare benign but often locally aggressive tumor of the plantar aponeurosis. Nonsurgical treatment is the first line of treatment for symptomatic lesions. Because of the high recurrence rate associated with surgical treatment, operation is indicated only when the lesions are highly symptomatic and conservative measures fail or the diagnosis is in question. The purpose of this technical note is to report the details of endoscopic subtotal fasciectomy. This may reduce the risks of skin necrosis and dehiscence, infection, and formation of painful hypertrophic scars."
"A 44-year-old man with familial adenomatous polyposis underwent laparoscopic-assistedtotal proctocolectomy with ilealpouch anal anastomosis(IPAA). Computed tomography conducted 21 months after IPAA demonstrated bilateral hydronephrosis andan intra-abdominal mass with a maximal diameter of 22 cm, leading to a diagnosis of stage IV desmoid disease, according to the classification by Church and associates. Six courses of combination chemotherapy with doxorubicin plus dacarbazine were administered. Computed tomography after chemotherapy demonstrated marked shrinkage of the desmoidtumor with intraabdominal air andfluidcollection extending just below the skin of the ileostomy closure site. Stoollike fluidoverflowedspontaneously through the site of the ileostomy closure andthe abscess cavity was successfully drained. The patient was discharged 30 days after the start of drainage. The patient is doing well 10 months after the drainage without regrowth of the desmoid tumor, even though a cavity-like lesion encapsulatedby a thick wall remains."
"27-60) years. The median duration of pazopanib treatment was 12 (range: 5-22) months and for three patients the treatment is ongoing. Three patients discontinued treatment early (patient preference, intolerable toxicity and logistical reasons, respectively). None of the patients showed radiological progression while on treatment, best responses according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 1.1 were partial response in 3/8 and stable disease in 5/8 cases. Six patients derived clinical benefit from treatment in terms of improved function and/or pain reduction. Median progression-free survival was 13.5 (5-36) months. Only one patient experienced intolerable toxicity (grade 3 hypertension) leading to early treatment discontinuation. In our series of patients with DT/AF, pazopanib demonstrated important activity both in terms of symptom control (75%) and absence of radiological progression (100%). Results of ongoing confirmatory trials are eagerly awaited."
"The targeted nuclease revolution (TALENs, CRISPR/Cas9) now allows Xenopus researchers to rapidly generate custom on-demand genetic knockout models. These novel methods to perform reverse genetics are unprecedented and are fueling a wide array of human disease models within the aquatic diploid model organism Xenopus tropicalis (X. tropicalis). This emerging technology review focuses on the tools to rapidly generate genetically engineered X. tropicalis models (GEXM), with a focus on establishment of genuine genetic and clinically relevant cancer models. We believe that due to particular advantageous characteristics, outlined within this review, GEXM will become a valuable alternative animal model for modeling human cancer. Furthermore, we provide perspectives of how GEXM will be used as a platform for elucidation of novel therapeutic targets and for preclinical drug validation. Finally, we also discuss some future prospects on how the recent expansions and adaptations of the CRISPR/Cas9 toolbox might influence and push forward X. tropicalis cancer research."
"Desmoid tumors (aggressive fibromatosis) are rare soft tissue tumors which frequently recur after surgery. Desmoid tumors arise from musculoaponeurotic tissue in the extremities, head and neck, abdominal wall, or intra-abdominally. Our aim was to examine the outcome of radiotherapy of desmoid tumors in a single institution series. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated 41 patients with desmoid tumors treated with 49 radiotherapies between 1987 and 2012. Radiologic images for response evaluation were reassessed and responses to treatment registered according to RECIST criteria 1.1. For patients with local failures radiation dose distribution was determined in each local failure volume using image co-registration. Recurrences were classified as in-target, marginal, or out-of-target. Prognostic factors for radiotherapy treatment failure were evaluated. RESULTS: Radiotherapy doses varied from 20-63 Gy (median 50 Gy) with a median fraction size of 2 Gy. The objective response rate to definitive radiotherapy was 55% (12/22 patients). Median time to response was 14 months. A statistically significant dose-response relation for definitive and postoperative radiotherapy was observed both in univariate (p-value 0.002) and in multivariate analysis (p-value 0.02) adjusted for potential confounding factors. Surgery before radiotherapy or surgical margin had no significant effect on time to progression. Nine of 11 (82%) local failures were classified as marginal and two of 11 (18%) in-target. None of the recurrences occurred totally out-of-target. CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy is a valuable option for treating desmoid tumors. Radiotherapy dose appears to be significantly associated to local control."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a rare benign tumor with no potential for metastasis; however, its aggressive nature causes treatment failure and episodes of recurrence. There is no report from Iran about the treatment of this tumor, and all published articles are single-case reports, therefore in this study, we report our experience from two of the largest referral centers of the South of Iran. Methods: During five years (2007-2011), among more than 20000 surgical pathology specimens, 25 cases of fibromatosis were identified. Clinicopathologic findings were recorded for all of the cases, and follow up history according to the patients' charts and direct contact by phone call were extracted. Results: There were 25 cases of fibromatosis, with female predominance, especially in the reproductive ages. All of the tumors had been located in the abdominal area, lower extremity, and head and neck area. Twenty-three cases had been operated for surgical excision. Fifteen cases had at least one episode of recurrence, mostly located in the abdominal area. No death or metastasis occurred. Conclusion: Clinicopathologic findings of desmoid tumor in Iran are very similar to other countries, however, there is still much controversy about the method of treatment for fibromatosis, and there are many challenges for patients, regarding multiple episodes of recurrence and the infiltrative aggressive nature of fibromatosis."

"beta-catenin immunohistochemical stain can be useful in the diagnosis of many tumors including desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF). Lymphoid enhancer-factor 1 (LEF1), a recently emerged marker, is part of the Wnt pathway with beta-catenin but has not been studied in DTF. We performed LEF1 and beta-catenin immunohistochemistry in DTF (n=26), superficial fibromatosis (n=19), sclerosing mesenteritis (n=12), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (n=17), and cutaneous scar (n=14) using tissue microarray and whole sections. The staining intensity was scored as strong (visible at x2 objective, value of 3), moderate (visible at x4, value of 2), weak (visible at x10, value of 1), and negative (not visible at x10, value of 0). The percentage of positive nuclei was recorded in 10% increment. Histologic scores were generated by multiplying numerical value of intensity and percentage of positive nuclei. A score of at least 10 was defined as positive. Eighteen of the 25 DTF were positive for LEF1 while 12 of 25 were positive for beta-catenin (1 excluded due to loss of tissue). Gastrointestinal stromal tumor cases were negative for both markers. All superficial fibromatoses were negative except 2 cases with weak positivity for LEF1 but not beta-catenin. Only 2 case of sclerosing mesenteritis were weakly positive for LEF1 but negative for beta-catenin. Ten of 14 scars were positive for LEF1 but only 1 of them was weakly positive for beta-catenin. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that LEF1 may be a useful marker in the differential diagnosis of DTF in certain contexts. However, caution should be exercised since LEF1 positivity can also be seen in scars."

"Neuromuscular choristoma (NMC) is a rare benign peripheral nerve lesion consisting of mature skeletal muscle fibers admixed with nerve fascicles. Aggressive fibromatosis frequently develops in association with NMC, often after surgery or biopsy, but the exact pathogenesis is not known. We present a case of NMC complicated by aggressive fibromatosis evaluated by F-FDG PET/CT and examine the relationship of metabolic activity and MRI signal characteristics."
"BACKGROUND Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is a common, serious cardiovascular event. Predisposing factors include genetic disorders, immobility, and underlying malignancy. Soft tissue tumors are by contrast rare, but should be included in the differential etiology of DVT, especially when the patient is young and has few thrombotic risk factors. CASE REPORT We present a 40-year-old patient whose initial diagnosis was spontaneous DVT of the lower leg, treated conventionally. Subsequently, he developed progressive calf swelling, which was diagnosed as multifocal desmoid fibromatosis, a rare and complex soft tissue tumor. CONCLUSIONS DVT is common but soft tissue tumors are rare. The disparity in incidence of these very distinct pathologies may contribute to late diagnosis of occult soft tissue pathology. We discuss the incidence, etiology, pathology, diagnosis, and best management of both desmoid fibromatosis and DVT, which may co-exist in a causative way."
"Desmoid tumours of the head and neck in children are rare, local invasive and potentially fatal tumours. The purpose of this review is to discuss the management of these tumours in the light of a case series and a review of the literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study summarised the medical data of children treated for desmoid tumours of the head and neck between 1976 and 2014. RESULTS: Five of the 6 children were treated by radical surgical resection, with positive surgical margins (R1) in 2 cases, followed by recurrence requiring further resection. One child with a very advanced lesion was treated by weekly methotrexate and vinorelbine chemotherapy for 18months, allowing 93% reduction of tumour volume without recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Desmoid tumours of the head and neck in children are more aggressive than their adult counterparts and are associated with high morbidity and mortality and a high recurrence rate. CT and MRI imaging assessment should preferably be performed before biopsy. External beam radiotherapy must be avoided in children as it is less effective than in adults, and is responsible for long-term cosmetic and functional sequelae and even a risk of second tumours. Treatment is surgical whenever radical resection is possible. In patients presenting an excessive risk of morbidity and mortality, chemotherapy devoid of long-term adverse effects (such as methotrexate in combination with a Vinca alkaloid) can be proposed. Long-term follow-up must be ensured due to the risk of recurrence."

"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF), also known as desmoid tumor, is an uncommon soft tissue neoplasm. AF does not metastasize, but it is locally invasive and its propensity for recurrence after conservative resection is well documented. No effective cytotoxic treatment has been reported, hence there is a need for novel treatment strategies. CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of an AF successfully treated with an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, pazopanib, with mild side effects. As far as we know, this is the first case of AF with complete response to pazopanib. CONCLUSION: Pazopanib might be an effective treatment option for AF."
"Fibromatosis and/or desmoid tumors which constitute less than 1% of all neoplasms and 3.0% of all soft-tissue tumors are pathologically benign proliferations of the fibroblasts but are locally aggressive with infiltrative type of growth and tendency toward recurrence. Bilateral symmetrical perirenal involvement has been described in many conditions which can be renal, subcapsular, or perirenal in origin. However, bilateral perirenal fibromatosis as an isolated presentation was very uncommon. We report an exceptionally rare case of bilateral perirenal fibromatosis with renal infiltration."
"Efficacy of liposomal doxorubicin (LD) in treating desmoid fibromatosis (DF) in children has not been well evaluated. This retrospective case series examines five children with progressive DF, treated with LD. We report progression-free intervals (PFIs) and radiographic as well as clinical responses for each medication received. LD was well tolerated, with an average 4.5% reduction in tumor size and median PFI of 29 months. Treatment with LD conferred the longest PFI of all medical therapies pursued. Thus, LD is an important treatment option for DF in pediatrics."
"Desmoid tumor of breast is a rare benign, locally aggressive tumor with a high recurrence rate. It has been associated with scar from previous breast surgery or trauma. Especially in breast cancer patients with previous operation history, it may simulate recurrent breast cancer clinically and radiologically. We presented multimodality imaging findings (ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography/computed tomography) of chest wall desmoid tumor mimicking recurrent breast cancer in a 38-year-old patient with a history of left modified mastectomy. The desmoid tumor is a rare benign tumor that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of malignant local tumor recurrence after breast cancer operation. Biopsy was required for accurate diagnosis and wide local excision was its appropriate surgical management."
"In total, 95% of primary tumors in the pancreas are epithelial tumors; primary mesenchymal tumors at this site are extremely rare. At present, only one comprehensive study about these rare tumors has been performed. Another retrospective analysis of these rare tumors is performed in the present study, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to be performed in China. In the present study, 10 patients that underwent resection for primary mesenchymal tumors of the pancreas were identified in a 15-year period at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, which accounted for 0.51% of the total surgically resected primary tumors of the pancreas at this hospital. Among the 10 patients, 7 patients (70%) were diagnosed with benign/borderline tumors, and the remaining 3 patients (30%) were diagnosed with malignant tumors. It was a unique finding of the present study that the preoperative diagnosis was frequently a misdiagnosis, in terms of the specific pathological diagnosis. Therefore, although primary mesenchymal tumors of the pancreas are extremely rare, they should be considered in order to make the correct preoperative diagnosis. Contrarily to a previous study, in the present study, the most common benign tumor was not desmoid tumor, but solitary fibrous tumors; the most frequent primary sarcoma was not undifferentiated/unclassified sarcoma either. In conclusion, the present study aids the understanding of these rare tumors; however, primary mesenchymal tumors of the pancreas require additional exploration in the future."
"Desmoid Tumours (DT) are benign tumours with an estimated incidence of 2-4 per million per year. Between 7-16% of them are associated with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) and are mostly parietal or intra-abdominal. They are a challenge in relation to their unpredictable natural course, associated complications and difficult treatment. AIM: The aim of the present study was to review the occurrence, management and follow-up of DT on FAP patients treated consecutively at a tertiary care center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of clinical data from patients treated consecutively between 1993 and 2014. Patients' data was gathered from clinical records. Data collection included the following variables: demographic data, genotype, FAP phenotype, data on FAP related surgery, DT diagnosis, location, size and number, DT treatment, patients' status and follow-up data. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 17 patients from 9 families; with a mean age of 41 years, mostly women (59%) and most with a mutation either on codon 232 or 554. Most tumours had an intra-abdominal component (59%) with a mean size of 5cm. Fifteen patients were first treated with pharmacotherapy (Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) and Tamoxifen). Five patients (29%) underwent surgery, 4 of them for complications of intra-abdominal tumours and 1 patient for abdominal wall tumours. Two patients underwent chemotherapy in relation to aggressive intra-abdominal disease. The mean follow-up time since diagnosis of DT was 123 months. Overall, 2 patients had remission, 11 patients had regression or stabilized disease, and 2 patients had progression. One patient died due to surgical complications. CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of DT is based on clinical symptoms, without the need for screening, although imaging plays an important role once diagnosis is suspected. The treatment approach is conservative on most patients, leaving surgery for DT related complications. The follow-up of patients with DT is also based on clinical symptoms."
"06182, 2010). The original guidelines were drawn up following a consensus meeting of UK sarcoma specialists convened under the auspices of the British Sarcoma Group (BSG) and were intended to provide a framework for the multidisciplinary care of patients with soft tissue sarcomas. This current version has been updated and amended with reference to other European and US guidance. There are specific recommendations for the management of selected subtypes of disease including retroperitoneal and uterine sarcomas, as well as aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumours) and other borderline tumours commonly managed by sarcoma services. An important aim in sarcoma management is early diagnosis and prompt referral. In the UK, any patient with a suspected soft tissue sarcoma should be referred to one of the specialist regional soft tissues sarcoma services, to be managed by a specialist sarcoma multidisciplinary team. Once the diagnosis has been confirmed using appropriate imaging, plus a biopsy, the main modality of management is usually surgical excision performed by a specialist surgeon. In tumours at higher risk of recurrence or metastasis pre- or post-operative radiotherapy should be considered. Systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) may be utilized in some cases where the histological subtype is considered more sensitive to systemic treatment. Regular follow-up is recommended to assess local control, development of metastatic disease, and any late-effects of treatment. For local recurrence, and more rarely in selected cases of metastatic disease, surgical resection would be considered. Treatment for metastases may include radiotherapy, or systemic therapy guided by the sarcoma subtype. In some cases, symptom control and palliative care support alone will be appropriate."
"Desmoplastic fibroma (DF) is a benign, rare fibroblastic intraosseous neoplasm histologically resembling a desmoid soft tissue tumor. Although classified as benign, DF frequently exhibits an aggressive behavior, has a moderate-to-high recurrence rate, and often causes pathological fractures and extensive bone destruction. This case report presents an incidentally detected DF of the tibia, which was diagnosed using a minimally invasive approach. A 36-year-old African female patient was referred to the Department of Diagnostic Imaging of Arcispedale Santa Maria Nuova-IRCCS (Reggio Emilia, Italy), to be examined by a computed tomography scan on an outpatient basis, after an x-ray examination of the tibia, which was performed after an injury to exclude the presence of a fracture, revealed a hyperlucency of unknown origin. The aim of this study was to discuss the clinical, histological, immunohistochemical and radiographic characteristics of this rare neoplasm, with a focus on image-guided bone biopsy."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is a locally aggressive benign soft tissue tumor. It is rarely observed in the head and neck region and is particularly uncommon in the parotid gland. This report describes the case of a 32-month-old girl with DF of the head and neck. The tumor was resected with gross residual tumors. Recurrence occurred 3 months later and then the patient was treated with iodine-125 interstitial brachytherapy. The tumor was completely absent 6 months after brachytherapy. No recurrence was found 60 months after brachytherapy during follow-up. No severe toxicities or growth abnormalities were observed. Very-low-dose rate brachytherapy as the sole modality could be a reasonable alternative for the treatment of inoperable DF of the head and neck, which avoids the risk of cosmetic deformity caused by surgery, especially in pediatric patients. In addition, long-term follow-up is recommended."
"In the last decade, percutaneous treatment of musculoskeletal (MSK) tumors has become more established in routine clinical care while also undergoing a number of advancements. Ablative techniques to palliate painful skeletal metastases have gained wide acceptance, while goals for ablation have evolved to include local control of oligometastases and desmoid tumors. Bone consolidation or augmentation is now frequently used in conjunction with or instead of ablation of skeletal tumors to stabilize pathologic fractures or prevent further morbidity that could result from fractures caused by tumor progression. These procedures have traditionally been performed with cement injection, although additional percutaneous consolidation or stabilization devices have been developed. Techniques to monitor the ablation zone and adjacent structures intraprocedurally are now applied to increase the number of tumors amenable to treatment. These include methods to depict, displace, or monitor critical structures adjacent to targeted MSK tumors. Finally, the role of ablation in the comprehensive care of patients with MSK tumors continues to change with the evolving triage of patients between radiation therapy, surgical resection and stabilization, and percutaneous ablative and consolidative management."
"Lynch syndrome (LS) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are major sources of hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) and are associated with other malignancies. There is some heterogeneity in management strategies in Japan. We undertook a survey of management of hereditary CRC in hospitals that are members of the Japan Society of Colorectal Cancer Research. One hundred and ninety departments responded, of which 127 were from designated cancer care hospitals (DCCHs) according to the Japanese government. There were 25 488 operations for CRC in these departments in 2015. The DCCHs performed better with regard to usage of Japan Society of Colorectal Cancer Research guidelines, referring new CRC patients for LS screening, and having in-house genetic counselors and knowledge of treatment for LS. There were 174 patients diagnosed with LS and 602 undergoing follow-up in 2011-2015, which is fewer than the number expected from CRC operations in 2015. These numbers were not affected by whether the institution was a DCCH. Universal screening for LS was carried out in 8% of the departments. In contrast, 541 patients were diagnosed with FAP and 273 received preventive proctocolectomy/colectomy in 2011-2015. The DCCH departments undertook more surgery than non-DCCH departments, although most of the management, including surgical procedures and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, was similar. Management of desmoid tumor in the abdominal cavity differed according to the number of patients treated. In conclusion, there was heterogeneity in management of LS but not FAP. Most patients with LS may be overlooked and universal screening for LS is not common in Japan."
"Fibromatosis is a mesenchymal lesion that consists of an infiltrative proliferation of fibroblasts without atypia.Thyroid fibromatosis is a rare entity in this gland. In previously reported cases, it has been associated with an invasive behaviour but this was not the case in our patient.When spindle-cell proliferation with fibroblastic/myofibroblastic characteristics is detected on thyroid histology, it is mandatory to exclude a papillary thyroid carcinoma with fibromatosis-like stroma."
"Desmoid tumor (DT) is a rare myofibroblastic proliferative neoplasm, but can occur in up to 26% of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Therefore, DT may be an extraintestinal manifestation of FAP that precedes the development of advanced malignancies. The aim of this study was to identify the incidence of polyps in DT patients and investigate value of colonoscopy for diagnosis of FAP in DT patients without gastrointestinal symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of patients diagnosed with DT were retrospectively reviewed using the clinical data warehouse (CDW) system. Clinical data, including location of tumor, type(s) of treatment, and colonoscopic findings, were collected. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were diagnosed with DT during the study period; 10 patients received colonoscopies before diagnosis of DT, and 20 patients received colonoscopies after diagnosis of DT. The mean age at diagnosis of DT was 41.9 +/- 16.7 years old (range 17-74). Most tumors were extra-abdominal (n = 24, 80.0%), and fewer were intra-abdominal (n = 4, 13.3%) or in an abdominal wall (n = 2, 6.7%). The colonoscopy results revealed one or two tubular adenomas in 11 patients (36.6%), although none of the patients had colorectal polyposis or colorectal cancer. CONCLUSION: None of the patients in our study population had colorectal polyposis. Routine colonoscopy of DT patients without gastrointestinal symptoms seems to have low diagnostic yield for detection of FAP."
"The purpose of the present review is to analyze the cytohistological and immunohistochemical characteristics of spindle-shaped mesenchymal gastrointestinal neoplams (MGNs), a group of unusual neoplastic conditions with different biological behavior. These tumors exhibit clinical pictures strictly related to the site of origin and dimensions, even if they appear generally with an intramural localization. This latter point may suggest an useful application of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA), mainly followed by the cell-block procedure (CBP) in the differential diagnostic approach. First of all, we discuss the most common entity of MGNs represented by gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), analyzing the morphologic characteristics and stressing the strength of immunohistochemical algorithm for diagnostic purposes. Successively, we have reported the less common group of spindle-shaped MGNs comprehensive of those arising elsewhere the soft tissues, such as leiomyomas, leiomyosarcomas, schwannomas, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor and intra-abdominal desmoid fibromatosis. Finally, very uncommon spindle-shaped MGNs, like clear cell, follicular dendritic cell, undifferentiated pleomorphic and radiation-induced sarcomas as well as spindle cell dedifferentiated liposarcomas, have been briefly mentioned."
"The clinical behavior of desmoid tumors can be unpredictable, particularly when they arise in the ante-partum or post-partum period. We present a case of an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor that was identified in the ante-partum period, progressed rapidly in the post-partum period, and was subsequently resected. PRESENTATION OF CASE: The patient is a 19 year-old female who was found to have a 12cm intra-abdominal mass on a fetal assessment ultrasound. The decision was made to observe the patient and monitor the mass for growth. However, the mass rapidly grew in the post-partum period. The patient was transferred to our institution after an exploratory laparotomy revealed a large intra-abdominal mass emanating from the small bowel mesentery. The 30cmx24cmx16cm mass was successfully resected with negative margins, and the pathologic diagnosis of desmoid tumor was confirmed. The patient had an uncomplicated post-operative course and was discharged on post-operative day 6. DISCUSSION: The majority of pregnancy-associated desmoid tumors are in the abdominal wall, arising from the rectus abdominus muscle or from previous Cesarean section scars. These tumors may spontaneously regress in the post-partum period and therefore, patients with these tumors are often observed. Close follow-up is important so that rapid tumor progression, which may lead to unresectability, can be identified and managed appropriately. CONCLUSION: A patient with a rare case of a giant pregnancy-associated, intra-abdominal desmoid tumor that rapidly progressed in the post-partum period and was successfully treated with surgical resection with negative margins."
"Desmoid tumors (DT) are rare and nonmetastasizing fibroblastic neoplasms, characterized by local invasiveness. They occur sporadically or arise in the context of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP; 5-10% of cases). Most cases develop sporadically in young adults, but some cases also occur in children. We report the case of an adolescent girl with FAP and DT, and we discuss the therapeutic strategies. An adolescent girl with FAP underwent surgery at the age of 14 years with total proctocolectomy. She had a neo-mutation in the APC gene at codon 1068, which is not usually associated with DT. Three years later, she had painful defecations. Imaging showed two abdominal DT. After a multidisciplinary team meeting, the patient was refused for surgery, and medical treatment with antihormonal agents and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was started. Imaging 18 months later showed DT stabilization, but the patient had difficulties to control chronic pains, which required morphine treatment, hypnotic sessions, and transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation. This case highlights the importance of DT screening in patients with FAP, mainly after surgery, regardless of their age and genetic mutation. Progress remains to be made in determining DT risk factors and in developing treatment. DT are still difficult to cure because of their potential for local invasion and local recurrence, and need to be managed by a multidisciplinary team."
"Before the wait-and-see policy became the standard approach in abdominal wall desmoid tumors, surgery was performed on a systematic basis. Surgery remains indicated for progressing tumors but its extent is debatable. The abdominal wall is a common site of origin of sporadic desmoids, usually associated with a favorable prognosis. We analyzed the results of surgery at this specific site. METHODS: Data from 33 patients affected by sporadic desmoid tumors of the abdominal wall (31 primary, 2 recurrent) consecutively treated at our cancer center between January 2000 and September 2013 were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients underwent surgery upfront and 1 after progression during the initial wait-and-see period. Prosthetic reconstruction of the abdominal wall was required in 28 patients. The average hospital stay was 5 days. Three patients developed surgical complications. Local recurrence-free survival was 90% at 5 and 10 years. Three patients had an uneventful childbirth during the follow-up after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Desmoid tumors of the abdominal wall have a favorable prognosis after surgical resection, which remains a safe and effective treatment. Wild-type tumors are common, whereas the incidence of S45F mutation in the beta-catenin gene is lower than in other anatomic sites. Upfront surgery may be considered in selected women who wish to bear a child."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis rarely occurs in the oral tongue. Diagnostic imaging, including ultrasound, is useful for delineating the extent of the lesion and can aid in treatment planning. However, definitive diagnosis is made based on the characteristic histologic features, which include cytologically bland spindle cells with surrounding collagenous matrix and minimal mitotic activity. Immunohistochemical analysis of these lesions reveals that they are classically positive, at least focally, for smooth muscle actin, calponin and muscle-specific actin. These features are exemplified in this sine qua non radiology-pathology correlation article."
"Nearly half of soft tissue sarcomas are nonrhabdomyosarcomas (NRSTSs). The low-grade (LG) form comprises a heterogenous group of diseases that rarely metastasize but are known for local recurrence. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study was to retrospectively evaluate pediatric LG-NRSTS with regard to demography, survival, and factors affecting outcome in Egyptian patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study reviewed 66 NRSTS patients who presented to the Pediatric Oncology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, between January 2008 and December 2013. RESULTS: Out of the reviewed cases 32 patients had LG tumors and were eligible for analysis. The male to female ratio was 1:1 and the median age was 7.5 years (range, 1 mo to 18 y). Desmoid fibromatosis (N=18) showed frequent local recurrence and nearly half of this group was alive without disease. No recurrence of the disease occurred in the nonfibromatosis group (n=14) and all patients were alive and free of disease. The 5-year overall survival was 88% for the entire group of study patients versus 45% for event-free survival. Tumors >5 cm in diameter and fibromatosis histology subtype were associated with lower EFS. CONCLUSIONS: LG-NRSTS generally has good prognosis, with overall survival reaching 90%. However, aggressive fibromatosis usually runs a poorer course in the form of high incidence of local recurrence and lower survival rates. This needs to be further assessed in larger prospective studies including novel therapies in addition to the current conventional modalities."
"The purpose of the study was to review a large series of chest aggressive fibromatosis (AF) cases with an emphasis on the outcomes of different degrees of resection and the value of postoperative radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of patients with chest AF treated at our hospital from 1982 to 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Recurrence rates and non-disease survival (NDS) times were compared between the R0, R1, and R2 resection groups. RESULTS: Forty-seven cases of chest AF were treated during the study period (21 men, 26 women), with an average age at diagnosis of 40 years (range, 9-77 years). One patient died before surgery, and 46 patients received a total of 85 resections. Forty-one patients had complete follow-up data, and the average follow-up time was 125.6 months (range, 11-524 months). Recurrence rates were 6.7%, 92.9%, and 100% for the R0, R1, and R2 resection groups, respectively, and the R0 recurrence rate was significantly lower than the R1 and R2 rates (both P values < 0.001). The NDS time of the R0, R1, and R2 groups was 80.3 +/- 64.8, 23.6 +/- 38.7, and 9.8 +/- 10.8 months, respectively; the NDS time of the R0 group was significantly longer than that of the R1 and R2 groups (both P values < 0.01). Within each resection type, no significant differences were found in the recurrence rates of patients having surgery alone compared with those receiving surgery and radiotherapy (all P values > 0.05). CONCLUSION: R0 resection is the most effective treatment for chest AF. Postoperative radiotherapy did not reduce the recurrence rate."

"S100a4 is a calcium-binding protein belonging to the family of S100-proteins, highly expressed in different stromal cell types. S100A4 has been reported as a prognostic marker in colorectal cancer in association with tumour progression and metastasis. METHODS: In this study, we analysed the in vivo role of S100a4 in intestinal tumour initiation and progression using different transgenic and knockout mouse models. RESULTS: We found that genetic ablation or overexpression of S100a4 in both Apc- and Smad4-mutant mice do not affect tumour initiation in the intestinal tract. In contrast, S100a4 epithelial overexpression in Apc(1638N/+)/KRAS(V12G) mice increases the dissemination of intestinal tumour cells to the liver, in agreement with its role in tumour metastasis. Moreover, we report a novel role for S100a4 in desmoid formation where S100a4 deficiency results in a significant reduction of the tumour burden characteristic of the Apc(1638N) model. In agreement with these results, S100a4 appears to be co-expressed together with mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) markers in desmoid tumours from Apc(1638N/+) mice, as well as from sporadic and hereditary human desmoids. CONCLUSION: Our data provide the first report on the in vivo role of S100a4 in intestinal tumourigenesis and describe a new role for S100a4 in the aetiology of desmoids formation."
"Tumour infiltration of the carotid arteries, especially the common carotid artery (CCA) and the internal carotid artery (ICA), is a great challenge in maxillofacial surgery. Cases in which the malignant tumour and/or lymph node is stuck to the carotid artery, especially the ICA, have previously been considered inoperable. Four such cases, two with recurrent metastatic nodal neck masses encasing the ICA, one with aggressive fibromatosis, and one with a carotid body tumour, are described herein. Successful resection of the mass along with the ICA was performed in all cases after a positive balloon occlusion test. All patients made an uneventful recovery with no signs or symptoms of any neurological deficits. In addition, all of the patients were free of disease for the whole postoperative period of 18 months."
"Various histological variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma have been reported, some with clinical implications, some with peculiar, sometimes misleading morphologies. One of these rare and poorly characterized variants is papillary thyroid carcinoma with nodular fasciitis-like stroma, of which fewer than 30 cases have been documented, mostly as isolated reports. It is a dual tumor comprising a malignant epithelial proliferation that harbors typical features of conventional papillary thyroid carcinoma, admixed with a prominent mesenchymal proliferation resembling nodular fasciitis or fibromatosis. Thus, the terms papillary thyroid carcinoma with nodular fasciitis-like stroma and papillary thyroid carcinoma with fibromatosis-like stroma are used interchangeably; however, the former term suggests a self-limited and regressing disease, whereas the latter one suggests a recurrent and potentially aggressive one. Better genetic and ultrastructural characterization could lead to more appropriate terminology and management. We performed detailed clinicopathological and molecular analyses of two cases of PTC with prominent mesenchymal proliferation that developed in the thyroid gland of two male patients aged 34 and 48. In both cases, the epithelial component harbored a heterozygous somatic activating BRAF mutation (p.V600E). Also, in both cases, the mesenchymal component showed typical aberrant nuclear and cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for beta-catenin and harbored a heterozygous somatic activating mutation in the corresponding CTNNB1 gene (p.S45P). This mutation has never been reported in thyroid stroma; in other tissues, it is typical of desmoid-type fibromatosis rather than nodular fasciitis-like stroma. We therefore propose that in cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma with a prominent mesenchymal component, mutations in CTNNB1 should be sought; when they are present, the term 'papillary thyroid carcinoma with desmoid-type fibromatosis' should be used. As the mesenchymal component of these tumors is not expected to concentrate radioactive iodine, special considerations apply to clinical evaluation and follow-up, which should be brought to the attention of the treating specialist."

"Desmoid tumors, also known as aggressive fibromatosis, are locally infiltrating musculoaponeurotic neoplasms arising in connective tissues. Desmoid tumors may be associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a genetic disorder that presents with hundreds to thousands of precancerous colorectal polyps. The authors report the case of an 18-month-old boy who underwent resection of a right temporal desmoid tumor (initially diagnosed as cranial fasciitis) and developed a bilateral frontoparietal calvarial desmoid tumor 2 years later. The patient underwent gross-total resection of the tumor that required a large cranioplasty. He was subsequently diagnosed with FAP. The patient has been without tumor recurrence for 9 years afterwards and has not required revision of his cranioplasty. This is the first report describing a recurrent cranial desmoid tumor in a pediatric patient with FAP. The authors believe, however, that some of the cases previously reported as cranial fasciitis are likely desmoid tumors pathobiologically and genetically."
"Desmoid tumors, which are associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), tend to occur frequently in the abdominal wall and mesentery. Currently, there are no recognized treatments other than surgery, and frequent surgeries result in gastrointestinal obstructions and functional gastrointestinal disorders. CASE PRESENTATION: After surgery that was performed on a 39-year-old patient with FAP, we performed a second tumor excision which was the procedure used for frequently occurring mesenteric desmoid tumors. It was determined that the enlarged tumor would be difficult to operate on through an abdominal incision. Subsequently, the carbon ion radiotherapy of 50 Gy was then performed on the patient. Three years later, the tumor still remains reduced in size. In addition, we have not observed any negative effect on the digestive tract. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first instance that the carbon ion radiotherapy has been effective for the unresected desmoid tumor, and it is believed that this will become the one effective option for the treatment of desmoid tumors."
"Surgical resection of desmoid tumors has traditionally been the mainstay of therapy, but this is a potentially morbid approach with high rates of recurrence. Given increasing reports of active surveillance in this disease, we sought to evaluate our experience with conservative management hypothesizing this would be an effective strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a prospectively maintained database of sarcoma patients from 2008 to 2015, we identified 47 patients with a diagnosis of desmoid tumor from all anatomic sites. Data points were abstracted on clinical and pathologic factors, disease stability or progression, and follow-up time. Main outcome measurements were tumor recurrence after surgical resection versus tumor progression with conservative management. RESULTS: In our cohort, 20 patients were managed with surveillance, 24 patients with surgery, and three patients with other approaches. Clinical and tumor characteristics between treatment groups were not significantly different. With a median follow-up of 35.7 mo, there was one complete regression, five partial regressions, and 13 stable diseases among the surveillance group. Only one patient under observation progressed, crossing over to surgical resection. Among 24 patients managed with surgery, 13 patients developed local recurrence. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a statistically superior progression-free survival in the surveillance group (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective analysis adds to the growing body of evidence that observation of desmoid tumors is safe and effective with high rates of stable disease. These data further support an initial conservative approach to desmoid tumors that may spare patients the morbidity and risk of recurrence that accompanies potentially extensive operations."
"A 25 years married women having one child delivered vaginaly presented in the department of Obs & Gynae, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Bangladesh on April 2013 with pelvic pain and discomfort. No history of previous pelvic trauma was present. Patient examination showed a isolated mass in the right lower abdomen, right adnexa, extending to the pelvic wall upto lower end of ureter. Tumor markers were within normal limit. Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) showed mild right hydroureter and hydronephrosis with obstruction at the lower end of ureter. She was diagnosed as a case of adnexal mass with mild hydroureter & mild hydronephrosis and it was decided to operate on the patient. The surgical approach was transabdominal. On laparotomy a pseudocystic lesion 12x10cm in size was found over the right paracolic gutter and extending down into the pelvis involving the right parametrium. No abnormality was found in the uterus or tubes. The histological examination revealed a desmoid tumor of the pelvis. The patient's recovery was uneventful."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis of the breast (also referred to as desmoid tumor or aggressive fibromatosis) is exceedingly rare. Although it does not metastasize, desmoid-type fibromatosisis is frequently locally aggressive. Recurrence is common (up to 35%), even after presumed total excision of the primary tumor [1]. The breast is an unusual location for the development of this tumor, with relatively few cases reported in the literature. We report a case of desmoid-type fibromatosis in the breast in a 31-year-old female who presented with a four-month history of a palpable left breast mass. Her imaging was discordant, so she underwent surgical excision of the mass. Multiple positive margins were present. She underwent re-excision to the level of the sternum medially. Final pathology showed a focally positive posterior margin, without muscle or fascial involvement. The patient's case was discussed at the multidisciplinary tumor board conference and no further intervention was recommended. To our knowledge, this is the first case report in the literature in which negative margins were unable to be achieved for desmoid tumors of the breast operatively."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a rare nonmetastasizing neoplasm with variable behavior. Recent discoveries into the biology of this disease hold promise for identifying prognostic and predictive features and novel therapeutic targets. Surgery has been the historical standard of care but carries considerable drawbacks in terms of high local recurrence rates and poor functional outcomes. Improved understanding of the natural history of desmoid-type fibromatosis has resulted in a paradigm shift toward nonoperative management. Effective medical treatment options include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, hormone therapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and targeted agents. A treatment algorithm has been proposed with the objective of optimizing treatment."
"Desmoid tumor of the breast is very rare and locally aggressive but has no distant metastasis. Bilateral lesions are extremely rare, found in only 4% of patients. Two cases of bilateral desmoid tumor of the breast are reported. The clinical presentation, diagnosis, imaging, treatment, and follow-up outcomes of recurrence as well as a brief literature review are provided. CASE REPORTS: Case 1 is a 31-year-old woman who presented with nipple retraction. An ultrasound revealed BIRAD V in both breasts. She underwent a bilateral excisional biopsy under ultrasound mark with the pathology result of extra-abdominal desmoid tumor in both breasts. The patient had a bilateral mastectomy with silicone implantation due to the involved margins by excision. She remained tumor free after 7-year follow-up. Case 2 is a 28-year-old woman who presented with a lump on her right breast that she had discovered ~2 months earlier. An ultrasound showed a spiculated mass in the right breast and some circumscribed hypoechoic masses in both breasts. A bilateral breast excision was done. The pathology result was an extra-abdominal desmoid tumor. She had recurrence on both sides and underwent a mastectomy and silicone implantation. The tumor has not recurred after 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSION: Imaging cannot distinguish between benign breast lesions and malignancy. Pathology results are helpful in making a definitive diagnosis. Given that the desmoid tumor is locally aggressive, a local excision with clear margins is recommended. Chemotherapy and hormonal treatment are controversial."
"Desmoid tumors are locally aggressive and non-metastatic neoplasms with a high rate of recurrence. Desmoid tumors of the pancreas are, however, very rare, and only a few cases have been reported in the literature. This paper reports an anecdotal case of a diffuse pancreatic desmoid tumor with the involvement of the pancreatic head, body, and-partially-tail. The patient underwent the Whipple procedure and subtotal pancreatectomy. Histopathological assessment showed that the tissues were partly positive for smooth muscle actin, but not for S100 or PanCK. The Ki67 index of the cells was only 1 %. Unfortunately, the patient died on the 10th postoperative day due to massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding."
"The efficacy of the classical treatment modalities surgery and radiotherapy in the treatment of aggressive fibromatosis is presently disputed and there is a shift towards a more conservative approach. The aim of the present study is to objectify tumor growth in patients with extra-abdominal or abdominal wall aggressive fibromatosis, while adhering to a ""watchful waiting"" policy. Other objectives are to investigate quality of life and to identify factors associated with tumor growth, in particular the relation with the presence of a CTNNB1-gene mutation in the tumor. DESIGN AND METHODS: GRAFITI is a nationwide, multicenter, prospective registration trial. All patients with extra-abdominal or abdominal wall aggressive fibromatosis are eligible for inclusion in the study. Main exclusion criteria are: history of familiar adenomatous polyposis, severe pain, functional impairment, life/limb threating situations in case of progressive disease. Patients included in the study will be treated with a watchful waiting policy during a period of 5 years. Imaging studies with ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging scan will be performed during follow-up to monitor possible growth: the first years every 3 months, the second year twice and the yearly. In addition patients will be asked to complete a quality of life questionnaire on specific follow-up moments. The primary endpoint is the rate of progression per year, defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). Secondary endpoints are quality of life and the rate of influence on tumor progression for several factors, such as CTNNB1-mutations, age and localization. DISCUSSION: This study will provide insight in tumor behavior, the effect on quality of life and clinicopathological factors predictive of tumor progression. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The GRAFITI trial is registered in the Netherlands National Trial Register (NTR), number 4714 ."
"Desmoid tumors are rare, comprising 3% of soft tissue tumors. Surgical resection has been the standard of care; however, this has begun to evolve into a movement of watchful waiting as observational studies have shown long-term stability of many tumors without treatment and even spontaneous regression in 5% to 10% of cases. When surgical therapy is used, wide local excision with microscopically negative margins is the goal of resection but should not be at the expense of organ or limb function. Recurrence rates after surgical resection are approximately 20%; a variety of multimodal therapies are useful in controlling disease."
"The management of truncal sarcoma presents unique challenges to the treating physician for reasons specific to this tumor location. First, the reconstruction options after resection of the abdominal or chest wall require a balance between cosmesis and structural integrity due to the multiplanar forces exerted on this region. Second, the histologies that commonly arise in this region are often associated with high local recurrence rates, which often require complex decision making due to prior therapy. Finally, sarcomas of the trunk in the inguinal region involve those organs in the genitourinary system, of which resection can have significant psychosocial implications."
"Desmoid tumors are rare proliferative and invasive benign lesions. They can be sporadic, but in most instances, desmoid tumors develop in the context of Gardner's syndrome with principal localization in the abdominal cavity and abdominal wall. CASE-REPORT: We report the case of a 24-year-old female presenting Gardner's syndrome with a symptomatic abdominal wall desmoid tumor. Lack of response to medical treatment led to surgical management consisting in a complete resection and parietal reconstruction with a biologic mesh. Postoperative course was uneventful and there was no evidence of recurrence at 12 months of follow-up. DISCUSSION: Conventional treatment of abdominal wall desmoid tumors consists in a wide and radical resection. However, complete resection is not always feasible because of difficulty to differentiate the desmoid tumor from adjacent tissues. The surgical approach may require different techniques to repair the parietal defect including prosthetic material such as synthetic or biologic meshes. Biological mesh is an ideal alternative to synthetic graft, mainly in case of infection. CONCLUSION: We have encountered a case of a symptomatic growing desmoid tumor of the abdominal wall in a young patient with Gardner's syndrome, successfully treated by complete resection and reconstruction with a biologic mesh to correct the parietal defect."
"When a soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is located at the distal part of an extremity and involves the tendon, a wide excision usually causes severe functional disability. We therefore developed a minimally invasive surgical technique using intraoperative electron-beam radiotherapy (IOERT) to reduce the incidence of post-operative functional disability in patients with peri-/intra-tendinous STS. We assessed the clinical outcomes of the novel minimally invasive surgery. METHODS: The study population included five patients who received treatment for distal extremity STSs. After elevating the tumor mass, including the tendon and nerve from the tumor bed with a wide margin, a lead board was inserted beneath the tumor mass to shield the normal tissue. IOERT (25-50 Gy) was then applied, and the tumor excised with care taken to maintain the continuity of the tendon. RESULTS: In a desmoid patient, local recurrence was observed outside the irradiated field. No cases of neuropathy or bone necrosis were observed. The mean limb function score was excellent in all patients. None of the high-grade sarcoma patients had local recurrence or distant metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Although the current study is only a pilot study with a small number of patients, it shows that this minimally invasive procedure has the potential to become a standard treatment option for selected patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: H17-250 (registered 2 November 2005) and H25-250 (modified from H17-250, registered 5 December 2013)."

"Imaging criteria for measuring the response of desmoid fibromatosis to systemic therapy are not well established. We evaluated a series of patients with desmoids who underwent systemic therapy to document magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features associated with a positive clinical response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective study included 23 patients (mean age 40.5) with 29 extra-abdominal tumors. Therapeutic regimens included cytotoxic chemotherapy (n = 19), targeted therapy (n = 3), and nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS; n = 1). Clinical effects were categorized as progressive disease, stable, or partial response. Maximum tumor dimension (Dmax), approximate tumor volume (VTumor), and quantitative tumor T2 hyperintensity and contrast enhancement (relative to muscle) for pre- and post-treatment MRIs were compared. RESULTS: Three lesions progressed, 5 lesions were stable, whereas 21 showed a clinical response. Dmax decreased more in responders (mean -11.0 %) than in stable/progressive lesions (mean -3.6 and 0 % respectively, p = 0.28, ANOVA); by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) 27 out of 29 lesions were ""stable,"" including the 3 progressive lesions. In responders, VTumor change averaged -29.4 %, but -19.2 % and +32.5 % in stable and progressive lesions respectively (p = 0.002, ANOVA); by 3D criteria 14 out of 29 lesions showed a partial response. T2 hyperintensity decreased by 50-54 % in partial response/stable disease, but only by 10 % in progressive lesions (p = 0.049, t test). Changes in contrast enhancement ranged from -23 % to 0 %, but were not statistically significant among response groups (p = 0.37). Change in T2 hyperintensity showed a positive correlation with volumetric change (r = 0.40). CONCLUSION: Decreases in volume and T2 hyperintensity reflect the positive response of desmoid fibromatosis to systemic therapy; RECIST 1.1 criteria are not sensitive to clinically determined tumor response."
"Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors (DTs) are a rare and anatomically diverse group of locally-aggressive, benign neoplasms. They are often difficult to diagnose, even in patients who possess risk factors for the disease. Even after a diagnosis has been reached, the optimal therapy is often not well-defined. PRESENTATION OF CASE: The case discussed of a 33-year old male with a giant intra-abdominal desmoid is an example of both the diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas that arise when confronted with a patient with a DT. Initial confusion over diagnosis led to ineffective therapy, but once the correct diagnosis was made, the patient went on to definitive surgical resection. DISCUSSION: The differential diagnosis of DTs is broad, and the diagnosis is often delayed due to nonspecific presentations. Immunohistochemistry is crucial in the accurate histological diagnosis, which guides treatment. Chemotherapy and radiation have a role in the management of both primary and recurrent lesions, but surgical resection remains the cornerstone of treatment. CONCLUSION: DTs present a clinical challenge in their diagnosis and management, and despite providing standard medical and surgical treatment, recurrence rates are high and continued surveillance is crucial."
"Desmoid-type fibromatoses are pathologically benign but locally aggressive tumors. We report the case of a desmoid tumor that disappeared spontaneously after recurrence. A 21-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of left lower limb weakness during menstruation. The following day this weakness had disappeared but menstrual colic remained; consequently, the patient underwent an internal examination that revealed an intrapelvic tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an enhanced mass (diameter, 8 cm) arising from the internal obturator muscle and attached to the urinary bladder. The tumor was diagnosed as a desmoid-type fibromatosis after histologic evaluation of a transvaginal biopsy; marginal resection was carried out at < 1 month after the first hospital admission. The patient experienced recurrence at 2 years after surgery, which was confirmed as two enhanced masses (diameter, 1 cm) using magnetic resonance imaging. Eleven months later, the diameters of these masses had increased to 1.8 cm; however, there was no further increase in size beyond this point. The patient delivered successfully at 5 and 7 years after surgery; at 8 years, the recurrent tumors had disappeared completely as confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. This case involving recurrence is rare for two reasons. The first was that no change in the size of the tumors occurred during pregnancy and after delivery, and the second was that the patient experienced complete remission of the recurrent tumors after only simple observation. Thus, it is important to recognize that even a recurrent desmoid tumor can sometimes exhibit spontaneous regression."
"Extra-abdominal desmoid tumor, also known as aggressive fibromatosis, has aggressive behavior with local infiltration and tendency for recurrence. Though head and neck is reported to be one of the most common sites, a desmoid tumor in the larynx is extremely rare. A 67-year-old male visited our hospital with prolonged hoarseness and received laryngo-microsurgery with the diagnosis of laryngeal polyp. After the operation, he eventually developed a laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma with papilloma, confirmed by second laryngo-microsurgery and received radiation therapy. After the third laryngo-microsurgery to remove residual papilloma, white irregular mass appeared on the right vocal cord and grew rapidly beneath the glottis, causing dyspnea. After 2 additional laryngo-microsurgeries, he was diagnosed having the dermoid tumor co-existing with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma. He underwent near-total laryngectomy and is currently alive without disease, speaking using a vocal shunt. Only five cases of the desmoid tumors arising in the adult larynx have been reported in the English literature. In this case, repeated surgery and radiation were suspected as the causes. Also, the present report is the first to describe desmoid tumor co-existing with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma in the larynx."
"Desmoid tumors (DTs) are non-metastatic, locally aggressive neoplasms with high postoperative recurrence rates. The pancreas is an extremely rare location for DTs. The local control of DTs is challenging. Surgery and radiotherapy are currently the principal treatment modalities for DTs; however, some resections might not be radical, and radiotherapy has several drawbacks. Therefore, many studies have been focusing on the molecular pathways involved in DTs in order to develop molecular-targeted therapies or chemotherapy. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has been demonstrated to play a role in the growth of DTs, and the pharmacologic blockade of COX resulted in decreased cell proliferation in desmoid cell cultures in vitro. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we report a 57-year-old woman who presented with recurrent epigastric pain and weight loss. An abdominal computed tomography scan showed an approximately 10-cm mass over the pancreatic head region and dilatation of the pancreatic duct. Tumor biopsy and bypass surgery were performed. A DT was confirmed on pathologic analysis. After resection, we prescribed treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. The patient showed complete remission and there was no local recurrence or distant metastasis within the 24-month follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of this case study is encouraging, and long-term follow-up studies are required to establish the effect of treatment with celecoxib on the prognosis of DTs."
"Fibromatosis or desmoid tumour is a benign fibroblastic proliferation with aggressive infiltrative growth. High incidence of recurrence is noted after incomplete resection of the involved margins of the lesion. Pelvic fibromatosis is a rare condition and usually affects females. Patients frequently complain of pelvic pain, which can mimic gynaecological abnormalities. A case of pelvic fibromatosis involving pelvic floor muscles with unchanged appearance during 5 years of follow-up is presented."
"The cell of origin for most mesenchymal tumors is unclear. One cell type that contributes to this lineages is the pericyte, a cell expressing Ng2/Cspg4. Using lineage tracing, we demonstrated that bone and soft tissue sarcomas driven by the deletion of the Trp53 tumor suppressor, or desmoid tumors driven by a mutation in Apc, can derive from cells expressing Ng2/Cspg4. Deletion of the Trp53 tumor suppressor gene in these cells resulted in the bone and soft tissue sarcomas that closely resemble human sarcomas, while stabilizing beta-catenin in this same cell type caused desmoid tumors. Comparing expression between Ng2/Cspg4-expressing pericytes lacking Trp53 and sarcomas that arose from deletion of Trp53 showed inhibition of beta-catenin signaling in the sarcomas. Activation of beta-catenin inhibited the formation and growth of sarcomas. Thus, pericytes can be a cell of origin for mesenchymal tumors, and beta-catenin dysregulation plays an important role in the neoplastic phenotype."
"benign (eg, myositis ossificans, myofibroma, fibromatosis colli), intermediate-locally aggressive (eg, lipofibromatosis, desmoid fibroma), intermediate-rarely metastasizing (eg, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, infantile fibrosarcoma, low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma), and malignant (eg, fibromyxoid sarcoma, adult fibrosarcoma). Imaging has a key role in the evaluation of lesion origin, extent, and involvement with adjacent structures, and in the treatment management and postresection surveillance of these tumors. The imaging findings of these tumors are often nonspecific. However, certain imaging features, such as low or intermediate signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images and extension along fascial planes, support the diagnosis of a fibroblastic or myofibroblastic tumor. In addition, certain tumors have characteristic imaging findings (eg, multiple subcutaneous or intramuscular lesions in infantile myofibromatosis, plaquelike growth pattern of Gardner fibroma, presence of adipose tissue in lipofibromatosis) or characteristic clinical manifestations (eg, great toe malformations in fibrodysplasia ossificans fibroma, neonatal torticollis in fibromatosis colli) that suggest the correct diagnosis. Knowledge of the syndrome associations of some of these tumors-for example, the association between familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome and both Gardner fibroma and desmoid fibromatosis, and that between nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome and cardiac fibroma-further facilitate a diagnosis. The recognition of key imaging findings can help guide treatment management and help avoid unnecessary intervention in cases of benign lesions such as myositis ossificans and fibromatosis colli. In this article, we describe the various types of fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors in children and the characteristic clinical manifestations, imaging features, and growth patterns of these neoplasms-all of which aid in the appropriate radiologic assessment and management of these lesions.

"Desmoid tumor (DT) is the primary cause of death in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) after restorative proctocolectomy. This study aimed to identify risk factors for DT in a Japanese population. METHODS: Clinical data for 319 patients with FAP undergoing first colectomy from 2000 to 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-seven FAP patients were included in this study. Thirty-nine (14.1 %) patients developed DT. Occurrence sites were the intraperitoneal region in 25 (64.1 %) cases, intraperitoneal region and abdominal wall in three (7.7 %), and abdominal wall in nine (23.1 %). The mean period from surgery to DT development was 26.3 months (range 4-120 months). Gender (female vs. male, p = 0.03), age at surgery (>30 vs. </=30 years, p = 0.02), purpose of surgery (prophylactic vs. cancer excision, p = 0.01), and surgical procedure (proctocolectomy [ileoanal anastomosis (IAA), ileoanal canal anastomosis (IACA), total proctocolectomy (TPC)] vs. total colectomy [ileorectal anastomosis, partial colectomy]; p = 0.03) significantly influenced the estimated cumulative risk of developing DT at 5 years after surgery. Conversely, approach (laparoscopic vs. open, p = 0.17) had no significant effect on the increased risk of DT occurrence. In multivariate analysis, female gender, with a hazard ratio of 2.2 (p = 0.02,) and proctocolectomy (IAA, IACA, TPC), with a hazard ratio of 2.2 (p = 0.03), were independent risk factors for DT incidence after colectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Female gender and proctocolectomy (IAA, IACA, TPC) were independent risk factors for developing DT after colectomy in patients with FAP."
"A minority of intra-abdominal desmoid tumors is associated with Gardner's syndrome in which desmoid tumors become an important cause of morbidity and mortality if they are surgically unresectable. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report two cases of intestinal perforation during chemotherapy in patients with Gardner's syndrome-associated intra-abdominal desmoids. One female and one male patients who developed inoperable desmoids were given the chemotherapeutic regimen of doxorubicin plus dacarbazine, followed by meloxicam. Significant tumor regression was observed clinically. However, intestinal perforation happened in both patients. They were subjected to emergency surgery, follow-up management, and survived up to now. CONCLUSIONS: The doxorubicin plus dacarbazine chemotherapy is an effective treatment for intra-abdominal demoid tumors in patients with Gardner's syndrome. On the other hand, given severe adverse events might occur, clinicians should pay more attention that tumor quick regression may cause intestinal perforation in which urgent surgical intervention is necessary."
"To elucidate the clinical benefit and safety of low-dose chemotherapy using methotrexate and vinblastine in patients (mostly adults) with progressive and/or symptomatic fibromatosis. METHODS: Patients were enrolled if they were treated with methotrexate and vinblastine chemotherapy for recurrences after surgical excision or newly diagnosed aggressive fibromatosis that was not amenable to surgical resection at the Korea University Medical Center from May 2008 to February 2016. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were treated with this regimen, and 21 were eligible for safety and efficacy analysis. Eleven (52%) of 21 patients showed a documented partial response (PR), and 11 showed stable disease (SD) by the end of treatment. All the patients who achieved PR reported a significant reduction in pain and improvement in the function of the affected lesions. Median progression-free survival was not reached at the time of analysis. The most common adverse event was abnormalities of the liver transaminases (overall 84.2%). The most common grade 3 or higher toxicity was neutropenia (36.8%), but no febrile neutropenic event was observed. The elevated levels of transaminases were normalized by reducing the dose of methotrexate or delaying treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose chemotherapy with methotrexate and vinblastine for 1 year was effective and well tolerated by adult patients with aggressive, recurrent fibromatosis."
"Desmoid tumours are one of the rarest tumours worldwide, with an estimated yearly incidence of 2-4 new cases per million people. They are soft tissue monoclonal neoplasms that originate from mesenchymal stem cells. It seems that the hormonal and immunological changes occurring during pregnancy may play a role in the severity and course of the disease. CLINICAL CASE: The case is presented on 28-year-old female in her fifth week of gestation, in whom an abdominal wall tumour was found attached to left adnexa and uterus while performing a prenatal ultrasound. The patient was followed up under clinical and ultrasonographic surveillance. When she presented with abnormal uterine activity at 38.2 weeks of gestation, she was admitted and obstetrics decided to perform a caesarean section. Tumour biopsy was taken during the procedure. Histopathology reported a desmoid fibromatosis. A contrast enhanced abdominal computed tomography scan was performed, showing a tumour of 26x20.5x18cm, with well-defined borders in contact with the uterus, left adnexa, bladder and abdominal wall, with no evidence of infiltration to adjacent structures. A laparotomy, with tumour resection, hysterectomy and left salpingo-oophorectomy, components separation techniques, polypropylene mesh insertion, and drainage was performed. The final histopathology report was desmoid fibromatosis. There is no evidence of recurrence after 6 months follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Desmoid tumours are locally aggressive and surgical resection with clear margins is the basis for the treatment of this disease, using radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy as an adjunct in the treatment."
"Protein 4.1B deficiency has been found to promote the tumor development; however, whether 4.1B deficiency participates in malignant transformation is unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that 4.1B gene deletion was sufficient to transform SV40T antigen-immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (iMEFs), as reflected by the ability of 4.1B(-/-) iMEFs to growth in the environments that were growth restrictive for 4.1B(+/+) iMEFs and to form tumors in nude mice, whereas 4.1B(+/+) iMEFs were unable to form tumors in vivo. The histological examination revealed that the tumors generated by 4.1B(-/-) iMEFs were desmoid tumors with features of local invasion. Moreover, loss of 4.1B significantly accelerated cell cycle progression, accompanied by activation of typical proto-oncogene ERK, AKT, and the G1/S regulatory pathway (p16(INK4A) -pRb pathway), and up-regulation of many members of the Wnt gene family. In particular, 4.1B(-/-) iMEFs exhibited nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin, which is an indicator for desmoid tumor, with down-regulation of E-cadherin expression and up-regulation of snail, zeb1, and vimentin expression, indicating that EMT potentially occurred in transformed 4.1B(-/-) iMEFs. Moreover, we showed that 4.1B interacted with E-cadherin in MEF cells. Thus, our study provides previously unidentified roles and mechanisms of 4.1B in cellular transformation.

"Desmoid tumors are uncommon and benign mesenchymal neoplasms. The optimal treatment of patients with desmoid tumors is still controversial. Surgery is the primary treatment for locally invasive or recurrent desmoid tumors. Also, radiotherapy is a treatment option for patients at high risk for local failure such as those with positive margins or recurrent and unresectable tumors. AIMS: To report our institutional experience and long-term results of patients with desmoid tumors who received radiotherapy. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study. METHODS: Between 1980 and 2009, 20 patients who received radiotherapy (RT) in our institution were analyzed. The majority of patients (80%) were referred with a recurrent tumor after previous surgery. Thirteen patients underwent marginal resection, 4 had wide local excision and 3 patients had only biopsy. Resection margin was positive in 15 (75%) patients. All patients received radiation therapy. The median prescribed dose was 60 Gy. Five patients received less than 54 Gy. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 77.5 months (28-283 months). Nine patients developed local recurrence after RT. Seven local failures (78%) were in field. Time to local recurrence ranged from 3-165 months (median 33 months). The 2-5 year local control (LC) rates were 80% and 69%, respectively. On univariate analysis, the 5 year local control rate was significantly better in the patients treated with >/=54 Gy than in patients who received <54 Gy (p=0.023). The most common acute side effect was grade 1-2 skin toxicity. As a late side effect of radiotherapy, soft tissue fibrosis was detected in 10 patients and lymphangitis was seen in 1 patient. One patient developed radiation-induced sarcoma. CONCLUSION: According to our results, radiotherapy is especially effective in recurrent disease and provides a high local control rate in the patients received more than 54 Gy."
"After colorectal cancer and desmoid tumors, duodenal adenocarcinoma is the next leading cause of death in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients, but it has not been thoroughly investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To investigate the clinical course of duodenal neoplasia, including adenoma and cancer, we investigated 77 Japanese FAP patients treated at the National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. We evaluated the clinicopathologic features, Spigelman severity score, and management of duodenal neoplasms. Data were acquired from a prospectively enrolled database. RESULTS: Fifty-one (66%) of the 77 FAP patients had duodenal neoplasia during this observational period, and 47 of 51 patients had extra-ampulla duodenal neoplasia; 42 (58%) had duodenal neoplasms (extra-ampulla), 4 had duodenal adenomas with high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and 1 had invasive carcinoma. Among the 45 patients (extra-ampulla) with duodenal adenoma with HGD or low-grade dysplasia, 8 (18%) patients were treated using endoscopic resection (ER). During the short observation period, ER was performed only in HGD cases. None of the patients died from duodenal neoplasia. In total, during the surveillance period, duodenal HGD was detected in 5 (63%) of 8 patients graded as Spigelman stage IV; HGD was not detected in stage 0 (n=33), I (n=0), II (n=12), or III (n=20) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Short-interval endoscopic surveillance and appropriate ER may help prevent duodenal invasive carcinoma. In addition, there was little development of invasive carcinoma during the follow-up. The Spigelman classification is beneficial for the risk assessment of duodenal neoplasia in Japanese FAP patients."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is defined as an intermediate tumor that rarely occurs in the head and neck of children. There is no doubt as to the value of complete surgical excision for desmoid-type fibromatosis. However, in pediatric patients, surgeons may often be concerned about making a wide excision because of the potential for functional morbidity. Some studies have reported a lack of correlation between margin status and recurrence. Therefore, we discussed our findings with a focus on the state of surgical margins. CASE PRESENTATION: We report an unusual case of a 9-month-old Japanese girl who prior to presenting at our hospital underwent debulking surgery twice with chemotherapy for desmoid-type fibromatosis of the tongue at another hospital. We performed a partial glossectomy and simultaneous reconstruction with local flap and achieved microscopic complete resection. We also reviewed available literature of pediatric desmoid-type fibromatosis in the head and neck. CONCLUSIONS: We described successful treatment for the refractory case of pediatric desmoid-type fibromatosis. The review results showed that some microscopic incomplete resections of tumors in pediatric patients with desmoid-type fibromatosis tended to be acceptable with surgical treatment."
"Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are rare solid tumors of mesenchymal cell origin that display a heterogenous mix of clinical and pathologic characteristics. STS can develop from fat, muscle, nerves, blood vessels, and other connective tissues. The evaluation and treatment of patients with STS requires a multidisciplinary team with demonstrated expertise in the management of these tumors. The complete NCCN Guidelines for Soft Tissue Sarcoma (available at NCCN.org) provide recommendations for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of extremity/superficial trunk/head and neck STS, as well as intra-abdominal/retroperitoneal STS, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, desmoid tumors, and rhabdomyosarcoma. This manuscript discusses guiding principles for the diagnosis and staging of STS and evidence for treatment modalities that include surgery, radiation, chemoradiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy."
"Mesenteric fibromatosis, also known as mesenteric desmoids, is part of the clinical-pathologic spectrum of deep fibromatosis, which encompasses a group of benign fibro-proliferative processes that are locally aggressive and have the capacity to infiltrate or recur without metastasis. CASE REPORT: Case of a 45-year-old man, with a history of hypertension and lung fibrosis, presenting for a left abdominal mass, which was found incidentally during his lung fibrosis imaging. He complained of constipation due to pressure upon his bowel leading to difficulty in defecation. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are many overlapping criteria between gastrointestinal stromal tumors and mesenteric fibromatosis, making it difficult to discriminate between the two, there are differences that are unique to mesenteric fibromatosis that should be noticed during the diagnosis. In this case, mesenteric fibromatosis was unusual as it is not associated with Gardner's syndrome, desmoid tumors, nor familial adenomatous polyposis, but was an incidental finding."
"Isolated limb perfusion (ILP) is an established and effective treatment for advanced melanoma and soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities with a high overall response rate. The aim of this study was to describe our experience of ILP for more rare types of tumours. METHODS: Patients with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) (n = 4), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (n = 2), B-cell lymphoma (n = 1), desmoid tumours (n = 3), pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) (n = 1) and giant cell tumour (n = 1) were treated with ILP and analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: The four patients with in-transit MCC had three complete responses (CR) and one partial response (PR); the two patients with SCC had one CR and one stable disease (SD); the patients with desmoid tumours had two PR and one SD. A CR was also observed for the patient with a giant cell tumour, but the patient with PVNS had a SD. The patient with cutaneous metastases of B-cell lymphoma showed a CR, however with rapid systemic progression. Local toxicity according to Wieberdink was grade II in 10 patients (83%) and grade III in two patients (17%). CONCLUSIONS: These results show that ILP can be used as a treatment option also for more rare disease entities when other treatments have failed."
"There is continuing controversy over the significance of prognostic factors in sporadic desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF). Further, only limited data is available in the literature concerning second recurrence in patients with recurrent DF. The purpose of this study was to identify prognostic factors influencing recurrence-free survival (RFS) and to determine rates of local recurrence (LR) in patients with primary and recurrent DF. METHODS: Fifty-three consecutive patients with DF who underwent surgery at a single institution were identified. As a result of strict exclusion criteria, a homogeneous cohort of thirty-two patients who received macroscopically complete resection was included in this study and split into a primary (PG) and recurrent disease (RG) group. Clinicopathological parameters and immunohistochemical markers were retrospectively and independently analyzed in both groups. RESULTS: The local recurrence rate was 35% for the PG and 33% for the RG. The PG's calculated median time to relapse was 17 months, and the RG's was 29 months. The estimated 1-, 5-, and 8-year RFS rates for the PG were 75%, 64%, and 55% while the corresponding RFS rates for the RG were 69%, 69%, and 52%, respectively. In primary disease, extraabdominal tumor location was the only significant adverse prognostic factor associated with worse RFS (p = 0.008). Whereas in recurrent disease, age >/=40 yrs (p = 0.022) and R0 margin status (p = 0.049) correlated with a significantly better outcome. CONCLUSION: Recurrence in primary and recurrent DF is characterized by different predictive factors and benefits from distinct therapeutic strategies. Immunohistochemical markers are valuable tools in the diagnosis of DF, although have limited potential in predicting the outcome."
"The family of pediatric fibroblastic and myofibroblastic proliferations encompasses a wide spectrum of pathologic entities with overlapping morphologies and ill-defined genetic abnormalities. Among the superficial lesions, lipofibromatosis (LPF), composed of an admixture of adipose tissue and fibroblastic elements, in the past has been variously classified as infantile fibromatosis or fibrous hamartoma of infancy. In this regard, we have encountered a group of superficial soft tissue tumors occurring in children and young adults, with a notably infiltrative growth pattern reminiscent of LPF, variable cytologic atypia, and a distinct immunoprofile of S100 protein and CD34 reactivity, suggestive of neural differentiation. SOX10 and melanocytic markers were negative in all cases tested. In contrast, a control group of classic LPF displayed bland, monomorphic histology and lacked S100 protein immunoreactivity. To define the pathogenetic abnormalities in these seemingly distinctive groups, we performed RNA sequencing for fusion gene discovery in 2 cases each, followed by screening for any novel alterations identified in a larger cohort representing both entities. The 2 index LPF-like neural tumors (LPF-NT) showed TPR-NTRK1 and TPM3-NTRK1 gene fusions, which were further validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Subsequent FISH screening of 14 LPF-NT identified recurrent NTRK1 gene rearrangements in 10 (71%) cases. Of the NTRK1-negative LPF-NT cases, 1 case each showed ROS1 and ALK gene rearrangements. In contrast, none of the 25 classic LPFs showed NTRK1 gene rearrangements, although regional abnormalities were noted in the 1q21-22 region by FISH in a majority of cases. Furthermore, NTRK1 immunostaining was positive only in NTRK1-rearranged S100-positive LPF-NT but negative in classic LPF. These results suggest that NTRK1 oncogenic activation through gene fusion defines a novel and distinct subset of soft tissue tumors resembling LPF, but displaying cytologic atypia and a neural immunophenotype, provisionally named LPF-like neural tumors."
"14 y, range <1 to 42 y), as masses involving the sciatic nerve (N=4) or brachial plexus (N=1). Four (of 5) NMCs had CTNNB1 mutations: 3 c.134 C>T (p.S45F) and 1 c.121 A>G (p.T41A). Four patients subsequently developed NMC-fibromatosis, and all 4 cases contained CTNNB1 mutations, including 1 p.T41A and 3 p.S45F mutations. In 3 patients, the NMC and NMC-fibromatosis had identical CTNNB1 mutations. Only 1 NMC had no detectable CTNNB1 mutation; however, the patient's subsequent NMC-fibromatosis had a CTNNB1 p.T41A mutation. All NMC and NMC-fibromatosis showed aberrant nuclear localization of beta-catenin, nuclear ERbeta expression, and no ERalpha expression. The presence of CTNNB1 mutations both in NMC and NMC-fibromatosis may be a shared molecular genetic abnormality underlying their pathogenesis."
"acute myeloid leukemia, aggressive fibromatosis, and adenocarcinoma of the colon. In the case of aggressive fibromatosis, the patient responded well to imatinib treatment. KIT mutations have never been reported in thyroid carcinomas. This is the first case of PTC-harboring KIT mutation. Although more work needs to be done to elucidate the significance of this germline mutation, the response of the fibromatosis patient to imatinib may shed light on targeted therapy in PTC harboring this mutation."
"Desmoid tumors are rare, musculoaponeurotic mesenchymal origin tumors arising from the proliferation of well-differentiated fibroblasts. Desmoid tumors may arise from any location with the abdominal cavity, abdominal wall and extremity locations being most frequent. We present the case of a 35-year-old female with a history of endometriosis who presented palpable abdominal mass and cyclic abdominal pain. Resection was performed for a presumed desmoid soft tissue tumor. Final pathology demonstrated desmoid histology admixed with abdominal wall endometriosis (endometrioma). This unique pathologic finding has only been rarely reported and is discussed with a brief review of the literature."
"To evaluate the rate of local recurrence of extra-abdominal desmoid tumor and compare the outcomes of surgical treatment and conservative treatment. METHODS: Twenty one patients (14 women and seven men), mean age 33.0+/-8.7 years old, with a diagnosis of desmoid tumor were evaluated. The mean follow-up period was 58.5+/-29.0 months. Fourteen cases involved the lower limbs, four cases involved the upper limbs, and three cases involved the trunk. The average tumor size was 12.7+/-7.5 cm. Of the 21 patients, 14 did not undergo previous treatment and seven patients relapsed before the initial evaluation. Surgical treatment was performed in 16 patients and conservative treatment was performed in five patients. RESULTS: Recurrence occurred in seven patients (33%) and six of them relapsed within the first 18 months. No significant difference was observed between conservative and surgical treatment. However, a significant difference was observed among patients undergoing wide resection and who experienced improved local control. CONCLUSION: The recurrence rate of desmoid tumor was 33.3%. There was no difference in recurrence between conservative and surgical treatment. In surgical treatment, wide margins showed better results for recurrence control. Level of Evidence III. Retrospective Observational Study."
"Timing of surgery, IRA or ileoanal pouch for classical FAP, laparoscopic or conventional surgery, TME or mesenteric dissection, preservation of the ileocolic vessels, handsewn or double-staple anastomosis, shape and size of pouch, protective ileostomy, Last and definitely not least: how to manage desmoid plaques or desmoids at the time of prophylactic surgery. For the depicted technicalities of the procedure, a review of recent literature was performed and evaluated. For the topics selected, only sparse reference in literature was identified that was focused on the specific condition situation of FAP. Almost all pouch literature focusses on the procedural aspects, and FAP patients are always a very minor number. Therefore it becomes obvious that the specific entity is not adequately taken into account. This is a serious bias for identification of important steps in the procedure that may be beneficial for patients with either of the diseases. The results of this study demonstrate that several technical differences for construction of ileoanal pouches in FAP patients deserve more attention and prospective evaluation-perhaps even randomized trials. The role, importance and potential benefit or deterioration of outcome in most of the discussed technicalities remains unclear to date. Significant differences between the underlying diseases (UC and FAP) have not been taken into consideration, such as specifically the management of precursor desmoid lesions at the time of prophylactic surgery as well as prevention of desmoid tumors. Several of the aspects discussed in this paper should be prospectively evaluated in larger and exclusive series of FAP patients."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is a locally aggressive fibroblastic neoplasm that has variable clinical and biologic behaviors ranging from indolent tumors that can undergo spontaneous regression to aggressive tumors with a tendency toward local invasion and recurrence. The management of DF has evolved considerably in the last decade from aggressive first-line surgery and radiation therapy to systemic treatment (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and targeted therapy) and symptomatic local control (surgery and radiation therapy). Imaging plays an important role in each of these treatment settings. In surgical candidates, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging are the modalities of choice for assessing resectability and surgical planning. For evaluating recurrence, MR imaging is the modality of choice for extra-abdominal recurrence, whereas CT is the preferred modality for intra-abdominal recurrence. Signal intensity changes at MR imaging can be used to monitor the biologic behavior of certain DFs chosen for expectant management. Response to systemic treatment with anti-inflammatory agents, hormonal therapy (eg, tamoxifen), cytotoxic chemotherapy (eg, doxorubicin, vinblastine, methotrexate), and targeted therapy (eg, sorafenib), as well as to radiation therapy, can be assessed at CT by monitoring size and attenuation changes or at MR imaging by monitoring size, T2 signal intensity, and degree of enhancement. Several patterns of response can be seen at imaging. Imaging also helps in detecting complications associated with systemic therapy and radiation therapy. ((c))RSNA, 2016."
"Neuromuscular choristomas (NMCs) are rare benign peripheral nerve lesions in which skeletal muscle tissue is admixed with nerve fascicles. METHODS: We describe a case of sciatic nerve NMC presenting with unilateral limb hypoplasia, monoparesis, and equinovarus contracture in a pediatric patient. We outline the unique clinical presentation and diagnostic work-up for our patient, including electromyographic and imaging studies. RESULTS: MRI revealed fusiform enlargement of the sciatic nerve, <50% intralesional fat, and signal characteristics similar to those of muscle tissue. Ultrasound was utilized to characterize atrophy and fatty infiltration of affected muscles. The patient was treated conservatively with a customized physical therapy program and lower limb orthosis. CONCLUSIONS: Emerging diagnostic criteria are highlighted with the goal of distinguishing NMCs from more common peripheral nerve lesions. This can have important clinical consequences, as unnecessary biopsies are associated with aggressive fibromatosis, a potentially devastating complication. Muscle Nerve 54: 797-801, 2016."
"Desmoid tumors represent a nonmalignant proliferation of fibroblast-related cells. These rare tumors are difficult to treat and often persist as indolent, lifelong conditions. There are a number of treatments available for both anatomic and symptom regression. Some of these treatments, unfortunately, may not provide long-lasting results and may result in further complications. Pain is a distressing symptom that may be due to the tumor itself or the result of utilized treatments. Pharmacologic therapies represent a noninvasive alternative to surgical resection. Pain symptoms require therapeutic regimens that must be modified as the tumor evolves in expression. The individualized pain treatment program utilized may often reflect principles used in both nonmalignant and malignant pain management models. This review seeks to increase awareness of desmoid tumors through a review of the literature and discussion of its pharmacotherapeutic management."
"resection margins, age, sex, tumor's size and location. Recent development is in favor of a non-aggressive treatment such as 'wait and see' procedures. Without radical treatment, these tumors could generate bowel compression or perforation. Due to their location and high risk of complication, surgery is the most fitted option."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) is a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal tumors that have locally infiltrative growth and a tendency to relapse. The clinical picture is often conditioned by the obstruction of the ureter or small intestine. Diagnosis is based on clinical, radiological and histological parameters. A CASE REPORT: We report a case of male patient, aged 35 years, with the retroperitoneal fibromatosis. He reported to the physician because of frequent urination with the feeling of pressure and pain. Computed tomography revealed the tumor mass on the front wall of the bladder with diameter of 70mm with signs of infiltration of the musculature of the anterior abdominal wall. Endoscopic transurethral biopsy showed proliferative lesion binders by type of fibromatosis. The tumor was surgically removed in a classical way. The patient feels well and has no recurrence thirty-six months after the operative procedure. CONCLUSION: The complete tumor resection is the therapeutic choice for the primary tumor as well as for a relapse."
"To assess the feasibility, safety and preliminary efficacy of magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) for the treatment of extra-abdominal desmoid tumours. METHODS: Fifteen patients with desmoid fibromatosis (six males, nine females; age range, 7-66 years) were treated with MRgFUS, with seven patients requiring multiple treatments (25 total treatments). Changes in viable and total tumour volumes were measured after treatment. Efficacy was evaluated using an exact one-sided Wilcoxon test to determine if the median reduction in viable tumour measured immediately after initial treatment exceeded a threshold of 50 % of the targeted volume. Median decrease after treatment of at least two points in numerical rating scale (NRS) worst and average pain scores was tested with an exact one-sided Wilcoxon test. Adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: After initial MRgFUS treatment, median viable targeted tumour volume decreased 63 %, significantly beyond our efficacy threshold (P = 0.0013). Median viable total tumour volume decreased (105 mL [interquartile range {IQR}, 217 mL] to 54 mL [IQR, 92 mL]) and pain improved (worst scores, 7.5 +/- 1.9 vs 2.7 +/- 2.6, P = 0.027; average scores, 6 +/- 2.3 vs 1.3 +/- 2, P = 0.021). Skin burn was the most common complication. CONCLUSIONS: MRgFUS significantly and durably reduced viable tumour volume and pain in this series of 15 patients with extra-abdominal desmoid fibromatosis. KEY POINTS: * Retrospective four-centre study shows MRgFUS safely and effectively treats extra-abdominal desmoid tumours * This non-invasive procedure can eradicate viable tumour in some cases * Alternatively, MRgFUS can provide durable control of tumour growth through repeated treatments * Compared to surgery or radiation, MRgFUS has relatively mild side effects."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a locally aggressive neoplasm composed of long sweeping fascicles of bland fibroblasts/myofibroblasts. Tumors with classic features are easy to identify, but the morphologic spectrum of this entity spans beyond the conventional histologic pattern. Since sampling of an unrecognized histologic variant may lead to misdiagnosis, especially on small needle biopsy specimens, we sought to fully characterize the morphologic spectrum of this entity. METHODS: We examined 165 cases of desmoid-type fibromatosis and catalogued the morphologic patterns and percentage of those patterns identified in each case. Clinicopathologic variables, including age, sex, location, and recurrence, were analyzed and correlated with pattern frequency. RESULTS: Seven morphologic patterns were identified, including conventional, hyalinized/hypocellular, staghorn vessel, myxoid, keloidal, nodular fasciitis-like, and hypercellular. The mean number of patterns per case was two, but some cases harbored up to five patterns. The greatest morphologic variability was seen in the intra-abdominal lesions, with these tumors having a significantly higher percentage of the keloidal and staghorn patterns compared with extra-abdominal and abdominal wall sites. No significant correlation between patient outcome (recurrence) and presence of variant morphologic pattern was observed (P = .549). CONCLUSIONS: The morphologic spectrum of desmoid-type fibromatosis is deceptively broad, and awareness of the variety of histologic patterns is critical for accurate diagnosis."
"Data supporting the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (TPC-IPAA) and total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (TC-IRA) for patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are limited. The aim of this study was to clarify the feasibility and morbidity of laparoscopic TPC-IPAA and TC-IRA for patients with FAP, using a large Japanese multicenter dataset. METHODS: Data on 256 patients with FAP who underwent TPC-IPAA (n = 171) or TC-IRA (n = 85) at 23 institutions between the years 2000 and 2012 were collected. Short- and long-term clinical outcomes were compared between laparoscopic and open approaches for each procedure. RESULTS: Among the 256 patients with FAP, a total of 126 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery, consisting of 74 laparoscopic TPC-IPAAs and 52 laparoscopic TC-IRAs. The proportion of the FAP patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery increased during the study period, reaching 79 % of all TPC-IPAAs and 82 % of all TC-IRAs in the final two years covered by the data. In both TPC-IPAA and TC-IRA, the laparoscopic approach was associated with a longer operative duration but a similarly low postoperative morbidity and comparably adequate anal function compared with the open approach. The overall survival and the incidence of desmoid tumor were also comparable between the laparoscopic and open approaches in both procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic TPC-IPAA and TC-IRA are both feasible options-with low rates of morbidity, good functional outcomes, and excellent overall survival rates-in patients with FAP. Since the data indicate that laparoscopic TPC-IPAA and TC-IRA are feasible, they also support the recent increase in laparoscopic surgery for patients with FAP in Japan."
"FOXM1 is a pro-proliferative transcription factor that promotes cell cycle progression at the G1-S, and G2-M transitions. It is activated by phosphorylation usually mediated by successive cyclin - cyclin dependent kinase complexes, and is highly expressed in sarcoma. p53 down regulates FOXM1 and FOXM1 inhibition is also partly dependent on Rb and p21. Abnormalities of p53 or Rb are frequent in sporadic sarcomas with bone or soft tissue sarcoma, accounting for 36% of index cancers in the high penetrance TP53 germline disorder, Li-Fraumeni syndrome.FOXM1 stimulates transcription of pluripotency related genes including SOX2, KLF4, OCT4, and NANOG many of which are important in sarcoma, a disorder of mesenchymal stem cell/ partially committed progenitor cells. In a selected specific, SOX2 is uniformly expressed in synovial sarcoma. Embryonic pathways preferentially used in stem cell such as Hippo, Hedgehog, and Wnt dominate in FOXM1 stoichiometry to alter rates of FOXM1 production or degradation. In undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, liposarcoma, and fibrosarcoma, dysregulation of the Hippo pathway increases expression of the effector co-transcriptional activator Yes-Associated Protein (YAP). A complex involving YAP and the transcription factor TEAD elevates FOXM1 in these sarcoma subtypes. In another scenario 80% of desmoid tumors have nuclear localization of beta-catenin, the Wnt pathway effector molecule. Thiazole antibiotics inhibit FOXM1 and because they have an auto-regulator loop FOXM1 expression is also inhibited. Current systemic treatment of sarcoma is of limited efficacy and inhibiting FOXM1 represents a potential new strategy."
"A woman in her 50s visited our hospital in February 2015 with a complaint of dull abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant. She had a medical history of appendectomy for appendicitis in her 20s. Computed tomography(CT)revealed a tumor 90 mm in diameter near the ileocecum. Elective surgery was planned under the suspicion of gastrointestinal tumor, malignant lymphoma, or ileal cancer. She was emergently hospitalized 1 day earlier than scheduled because of high fever and severe abdominal pain. CT revealed that the tumor had increased to 120 mm in diameter without free air. Her white blood cell count was not elevated, and her symptoms improved readily with medical treatment. Thus, we performed the operation as scheduled. A tumor with a dark red recess on the surface had invaded the transverse colon intraoperatively, and a small amount of purulent ascites was present at the pouch of Douglas. We performed ileocecal resection with partial transverse colectomy. Histopathological examination led to the diagnosis of desmoid tumor in the mesentery of the terminal ileum. The surgical margins were negative for tumor cells. The tumor surface around the recess showed peritonitis, and the ascites showed no bacteria or tumor cells. The patient had been doing well without recurrence after discharge. Some cases of desmoid tumor with peritonitis have been reported, but most were caused by tumor penetration into the intestinal tract. We report herein a rare case of intra-abdominal desmoid tumor with abacterial peritonitis."
"Creating TRAM flap in obese patient is a challenging issue with a hazard of flap ischemia and breast envelope loss or sepsis. In this case we show our experience in doing an interval TRAM flap in markedly obese patient (BMI index 39) in the presence of Desmoid tumor of the anterior abdominal wall on top of previous mesh hernioplasty in the contralateral side of the tumor. Interval TRAM was decided with achieving of a complete vascular delay in the same sitting with skin sparing mastectomy. On doing abdominal ultrasonography for perforator mapping a desmoid tumor was encountered in the contralateral side. The decision was to elevate the flap together with excision of the desmoid tumor with the flap to be sutured in situ at the end of operation and after 5 days to transfer the flap to the mastectomy site. There was no major complications apart from mild wound sepsis of the breast pocket that was controlled medically. According to our proposed aesthetical score, our patient expressed the outcome as good (8/10 points). Pedicled TRAM flap creation in markedly obese patients is hazardous and we recommend this new concept of interval TRAM for this situation. Moreover the presence of desmoid tumor in the rectus sheath is not a contraindication to this flap elevation. The presence of abdominal desmoid tumor is not a contraindication for TRAM flap provided that it can be resected with sparing of perforators on one side of the rectus sheath."
"We report a review of 208 cases of Meckel's diverticulum among pediatric patients from one single institution. One of the aims of this report is to highlight the different diagnostic modalities of Meckel's diverticulum since a majority of cases is undiagnosed prior to surgery. Our review shows 58 cases containing gastric and/or pancreatic heterotopic tissue, including two unique cases. The first case reported is a desmoid tumor arising at the tip of diverticulum, a case that, to our knowledge, has not been previously reported. The second case involves a female patient appearing with an acute abdomen thought to be appendicitis, instead surgery revealed a diverticulum arising from the ileum. The cause of acute abdomen was due to gonococcal infection. In conclusion, we hope that this large series of Meckel's cases will enrich our readers on the differential diagnosis and preoperative diagnostic techniques of Meckels' diverticulum."
"Extraabdominal desmoid (EAD) tumors pose a therapeutic challenge because they often recur locally and behave aggressively. Accepted management options include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and observation. The objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of percutaneous cryoablation for the treatment of EAD tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective search of our cryoablation database was performed to identify patients with EAD tumors treated with percutaneous cryoablation between June 15, 2004, and June 15, 2014. During this 10-year time period, we treated 18 patients with 26 discrete tumors during 31 treatment sessions. After cryoablation, contrast-enhanced MRI or CT was performed. Any enhancing soft tissue was considered viable EAD tumor and was measured in three planes. RESULTS: Of the 26 EAD tumors treated, follow-up imaging with IV contrast material was available for 23 tumors. The mean imaging follow-up was 16.2 +/- 20.0 (SD) months. All 31 sessions were technically successful procedures. No residual viable EAD tumor was observed in nine of 23 tumors (39.1%). Some degree of volume reduction was evident in 22 of 23 tumors (95.7%). Progressive disease was observed in one of the 23 tumors (4.3%). Of the cases with residual or progressive disease, the recurrence occurred at the margin of the treated tumor in all cases. No major complications were observed, and none of the complications was more severe than Clavien-Dindo grade I. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous cryoablation is a safe, effective, and repeatable treatment for achieving local control of EAD tumors."
"Aside from the CTNNB1 and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutations, the genetic profile of pediatric aggressive fibromatosis (AF) has remained poorly characterized. The aim of this study was to shed more light on the mutational spectrum of pediatric AF, comparing it with its adult counterpart, with a view to identifying biomarkers for use as prognostic factors or new potential therapeutic targets. CTNNB1, APC, AKT1, BRAF TP53, and RET Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing (NGS) with the 50-gene Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 were performed on formalin-fixed samples from 28 pediatric and 33 adult AFs. The prognostic value of CTNNB1, AKT1, and BRAF mutations in pediatric AF patients was investigated. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) curves were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and statistical comparisons were drawn using the log-rank test. In addition to the CTNNB1 mutation (64%), pediatric AF showed AKT1 (31%), BRAF (19%), and TP53 (9%) mutations, whereas only the CTNNB1 mutation was found in adult AF. The polymorphism Q472H VEGFR was identified in both pediatric (56%) and adult (40%) AF. Our results indicate that the mutational spectrum of pediatric AF is more complex than that of adult AF, with multiple gene mutations involving not only CTNNB1 but also AKT1 and BRAF. This intriguing finding may have clinical implications and warrants further investigations."
"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a hereditary condition with a near 100 % lifetime risk of colorectal cancer without prophylactic colectomy. Most patients with FAP have a mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene on chromosome 5q22. This condition frequently presents in children with polyps developing most frequently in the second decade of life and surveillance colonoscopy is required starting at age ten. Polyps are found not only in the colon, but in the stomach and duodenum. Knowledge of the natural history of FAP is important as there are several extra-colonic sequelae which also require surveillance. In infants and toddlers, there is an increased risk of hepatoblastoma, while in teenagers and adults duodenal carcinomas, desmoid tumors, thyroid cancer and medulloblastoma are more common in FAP than in the general population. Current chemopreventive strategies include several medications and natural products, although to this point there is no consensus on the most efficacious and safe agent. Genetic counseling is an important part of the diagnostic process for FAP. Appropriate use and interpretation of genetic testing is best accomplished with genetic counselor involvement as many families also have concerns regarding future insurability or discrimination when faced with genetic testing."
"The study was conducted to describe ultrasound-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (USgHIFU) ablation in the treatment of intra-abdominal aggressive fibromatosis in seven patients who had failed surgery. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated seven patients with pathologically proven intra-abdominal aggressive fibromatosis and surgical failure, who were treated with USgHIFU between June 2013 and February 2015. The main causes for surgical failure were a large tumour size or adjacent tissue invasion by the tumour. All of the patients were treated with palliative intent, to reduce symptoms of the diseases. The medical records were reviewed during the follow-up period, and the patients were asked to compare the symptoms of their disease as improved, unchanged or worsened, based on their levels before treatment. In addition, contrast-enhanced MRI was conducted to follow the size of the tumours before and after therapy. RESULTS: The procedure was successfully accomplished in all of the patients without severe side effects. The median diameter of the tumours was 10.3 cm (range, 7.6-13.6 cm) and the mean ablation rate (the percentage rate of the non-perfused volume compared with the tumour volume on enhanced MRI after treatment) was 92.5 +/- 3.7% (range, 86.5-96.8%). One patient underwent two treatments for a large tumour size, and other patients received single-visit therapy. All of the patient clinical symptoms remitted significantly after 6 months. The regression rates of the tumours were 34.8 +/- 8.2% (range, 22.4-46.1%) and 58.2 +/- 12.7% (range, 43.8-70.3%), respectively, at 6 and 12 months after treatment. CONCLUSION: USgHIFU ablation could be an effective alternative minimally invasive therapy for the achievement of local control of intra-abdominal aggressive fibromatosis. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: The conclusions indicate that USgHIFU ablation could be a promising alternative treatment for the achievement of local control of intra-abdominal aggressive fibromatosis."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is a rare disease, which often occurs in young adults. Medical treatment is an important option in the treatment algorithm of DF. Different chemotherapeutic regimens showed clinical activity in DF, but overall treatment tolerability remains poor for this patient cohort. Novel approaches investigated tyrosine kinase inhibitors in DF, but tolerability remained an issue. CASE PRESENTATION: We treated a patient with progressive DF after failure of chemotherapy for 1 year with singe agent bevacizumab. He achieved a symptomatic and radiologic response while attainning excellent tolerability. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on single agent bevacizumab in DF, which showed both, good tolerability and efficacy in our patient, thereby warranting future trials in DF."
"Desmoid fibromatosis, or aggressive fibromatosis, is a benign but locally infiltrative fibroblastic neoplasm arising from fascial or musculoaponeurotic tissues. Although lacking metastatic potential, head and neck fibromatosis can have significant functional or cosmetic morbidities. 7%-15% of all desmoid tumors are seen in the head and neck region, 57% of which occur in the pediatric population. The incidence of pediatric desmoid tumor peaks around age 8. Treatment of choice is complete surgical resection; however, local recurrence is common. We present a case of a 14-month-old male with an 8-cm desmoid tumor in the right parapharyngeal space and provide an overview of diagnosis and management of pediatric head and neck fibromatosis. This is the largest desmoid tumor of the parapharyngeal space in the youngest patient described in the literature."
"Desmoid tumors are rare clonal fibroblastic proliferations that can arise at abdominal or extra-abdominal sites. Complete surgical resection is the primary treatment for resectable desmoid tumors, but a high rate of local recurrence has been reported even after complete resection. For patients with a recurrent tumor, the goals of treatment are to control the recurrence, maintain quality of life, and prolong survival. Radiofrequency ablation, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and other medical therapies can be used as alternative methods, but there are considerable controversies over the roles of these methods in the management of desmoid tumors. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a minimally invasive and effective method for treatment of solid tumors. We used HIFU to treat four patients with intra-abdominal desmoid tumors from June 2011 to September 2013. Post-procedural pain was seen in all patients. One patient had an intra-abdominal abscess and another suffered a slight injury to the femoral nerve. The patients were followed up for 19-46 months (mean 34 months) until April 2015. The tumor in one patient disappeared, and no tumor progression was observed in the other patients."
"Desmoid tumors (DT) occur sporadically, in familial adenomatous polyposis, or in association with pregnancy. Initial observation has been proposed in the management of DT. An advantage of this approach is to select patients who have indolent disease versus those who require intervention. Here we report our multidisciplinary experience of abdominal DT as it relates to nonoperative management. METHODS: Patients seeking care from 1980 to 2012 with pathologically confirmed DT were identified from clinical research databases. Clinicopathologic data and management strategies were collected, and statistical analyses were performed by Chi square and t tests. RESULTS: A total of 213 patients were identified; DT occurred in abdominal wall (n = 103, 48 %), intra-abdominally (n = 92, 43 %), or at both sites (n = 18, 9 %). Patients were predominantly female (72 %); disease was sporadic (48 %), associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (38 %), or associated with pregnancy (14 %). Patient presentation was stratified into 3 groups: untreated (group A; n = 176), DT resected elsewhere (group B; n = 19), or recurrent DT (group C; n = 18). In group A, 109 patients were initially observed, with 51 patients requiring intervention as a result of progression or symptoms. Of the 58 patients who underwent only observation, 93 % experienced spontaneous regression or stable disease (median follow-up 38 months). Of the 67 patients in group A who underwent resection, 28 % experienced recurrence (median 22 months). Abdominal wall DT >7 cm and intra-abdominal DT were more likely to recur (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Initial observation has been implemented for abdominal DT at our institution. Over half of patients observed required no intervention with prolonged follow-up. Tumor size and site may predict progression during observation, therefore representing higher-risk groups."
"The aim of the present study was to identify the prognostic factors for the propensity for recurrence in sporadic desmoid tumors. The catenin (cadherin-associated protein) beta1 (CTNNB1) genotypes and expression of Wnt pathway proteins and midkine (also termed neurite growth-promoting factor 2) were investigated in 159 patients with sporadic desmoid tumors. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of the surgically resected desmoid tumors were examined by direct sequencing of CTNNB1 exon 3, and immunostained for the expression of beta-catenin, T-cell factor 4 (TCF-4), phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAkt), midkine and menin using a tissue microarray method. Among the samples, 70% (111/159) exhibited point mutations of the CTNNB1 gene, including T41A (56%), S45F (8%), S45P (2%), S45N (2%) and T42A (1%). In addition, 100, 57, 24, 15 and 92% of the tumors expressed beta-catenin, TCF-4, midkine, pAkt and menin, respectively. Positive midkine expression was significantly associated with the recurrence of tumors (P=0.001). The multivariate analysis of recurrence demonstrated that an extra-abdominal tumor site [hazard ratio (HR), 2.625; P=0.001] and midkine expression (HR, 2.077; P<0.009) were independent prognostic factors of tumor recurrence. In conclusion, the present results suggest that the tumor site and midkine expression may be predictive markers for the recurrence of sporadic desmoid tumors."
"To investigate the clinical features and surgical treatment of chest aggressive fibromatosis. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with aggressive fibromatosis treated from September 1998 to May 2014 in the Department of Thoracic Surgery of Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences were included in this study. RESULTS: The 25 patients, including 12 males and 13 famales, had an average age of 38 (range 15-76 years). The initial manifestations included chest pain (9 patients, 36.0%) and shortness of breath (1 patient). In 13 patients (52.0%) the tumor was found in a physical examination. Two patients (8.0%) were detected during an operation for lung disease. The tumor was located in the left chest wall in 15 patients, and located on the right side in 10 patients. Among them, the most common locations were the left front chest wall and the right front chest wall. The operation method affects the prognosis. Radiological imaging and needle biopsy did not make a correct diagnosis, and the diagnosis of aggressive fibromatosis was confirmed by pathology using immunohistechmistry after surgery. 13 patients underwent tumor resection, 9 cases had expanded resection, 3 patients had palliative resection. Six cases received radiotherapy after surgery. The median follow-up time was 101.5 months. Currently, all of the 25 patients are still alive, but 5 cases had local recurrence after surgery, among them, 4 patients received tumor resection, and one patient underwent expanded resection. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive fibromatosis is a low-grade malignant tumor. The diagnosis of aggressive fibromatosis needs to be confirmed by pathology using immunohistechmical staining after surgery. Although this tumor is liable to relapse, its prognosis is favorable. Radical surgery is the most important treatment for patients to get a higher quality of life and long-term survival without recurrence."
"The optimal management of rare tumours (i.e. from accurate diagnosis to management in reference centres) is a public health challenge. In 2009, the French National Cancer Institute (INCa) identified and financially supported the two expert networks for pathological and clinical diagnosis and management of soft tissue tumours. METHODS: The activities of both networks were prospectively collected using a nationwide database (rreps.org). Data describing the diagnosis management of 863 successive cases of desmoids tumours (DT) were prospectively collected from 2010 to 2013 and analysed. RESULTS: The number of confirmed DT constantly improved from January 2010 to December 2013 (from 173 to 273 cases per year); the expected incidence ranged from 132 to 330 cases/year. The rate of cases diagnosed with core-needle biopsies and CTNNB1 mutational status analysis increased from 30.6 to 40.7% and from 87.8 to 94.1%, respectively. The mean delay for pathological diagnosis confirmation constantly decreased from 107 to 47 d. Among the 846 adult patients, 414 (48.9%) patients were treated by reference centres. The rate of patients managed by reference centres constantly increased with time from 36.9 to 49.5% since 2010. The median management time of the referral centres constantly decreased from 440 to 67 d. CONCLUSION: The two expert networks worked synergistically and improved diagnosis modalities of rare desmoid tumours at a national level. The impact of management by expert networks on the outcome will be prospectively analysed in the future."
"Extra abdominal desmoid fibromatosis is a complex condition with many recognised treatments including active observation, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgical resection. There is large variation in the natural history of individual desmoid tumours, with some cases progressing aggressively and others regressing spontaneously when observed alone. This combined with an absence of accurate clinical predictors of a desmoid tumour's behaviour has led to difficulties in identifying which patients would benefit most from aggressive treatment, and which could be adequately managed with a policy of active observation alone. This review explores the aetiology and common presentation of extra-abdominal desmoid fibromatosis including the condition's histopathological, clinical and radiological characteristics. The current evidence for potential predictors of desmoid tumour behaviour is also reviewed, along with the indications and evidence for the multitude of treatments available. We also summarise the published guidelines that are currently available for oncologists and surgeons managing extra-abdominal desmoid fibromatosis, and highlight some of the unanswered questions that need to be addressed to optimise the management of this condition."
"Radiation therapy (RT) plays an important role in multimodality therapy for soft-tissue sarcomas (STS). RT treatment paradigms have evolved significantly in recent years, and many different complex RT modalities are commonly used in STS. These include external-beam RT, intensity-modulated RT, stereotactic body RT, and brachytherapy. Imaging is essential throughout the treatment process. Plain radiographs, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography, and positron emission tomography/CT all play potential roles in the management of STS. Before RT, high-quality imaging is needed to direct management decisions, both by global tumor staging and detailed assessment of the extent of local disease. At the time of RT, precise planning imaging is required to delineate tumor volumes, including gross tumor volume, clinical target volume, and planning target volume, which are used to direct therapy. In addition, imaging at the time of RT must outline the location of adjacent vital organs, to optimize treatment efficacy and minimize toxicity. After RT, imaging is needed to assess the patient for tumor response to therapy. In addition, imaging at regular intervals is often required to monitor for recurrence of disease and potential complications of therapy. The purpose of this review is to familiarize radiologists with the indications for RT in STS, common therapeutic modalities used, roles of imaging throughout the treatment process, and complications of therapy."

"This study describes the operative techniques and early clinical and nutritional outcomes after intestinal autotransplantation (IATx). BACKGROUND: IATx is a novel surgical strategy for patients with abdominal neoplasms involving the root of the superior mesenteric and/or celiac arteries, but the effects of IATx on clinical and nutritional outcomes are not well-known. METHODS: Six patients aged 24-67 years (mean, 54) underwent consecutive IATx in our center from January 2011 to January 2015. In all patients, selection and harvesting of a segmental autograft of bowel was carried out first, and radical en bloc resection of the neoplasm was performed second. RESULTS: One patient lost the autograft owing to arterial thrombosis 48 hours postoperatively, and another succumbed to a pancreatic fistula at 21 days. The remaining 4 patients survived with no evidence of tumor recurrence currently at 9-, 23-, 23-, and 39-months of follow-up. These 4 patients have had well-functioning autografts and have not required any intravenous fluid hydration since discharge. Serum d-xylose levels recovered fully 2 weeks postoperatively, and plasma proteins and cholesterol levels normalized 12-18 months later. The surviving 4 patients gained body weight without major alterations in lifestyle, work habits, or psychosocial conditions. CONCLUSION: Although IATx is associated with considerable operative risk, this aggressive approach allows patients with selected abdominal neoplasms involving the major mesenteric vessels to be completely resected and attain early intestinal autonomy from parenteral nutrition."
"Definitive radiotherapy is often used for chest wall desmoid tumours due to size or anatomical location. The delivery of radiotherapy is challenging due to the large size and constraints of normal surrounding structures. We compared the dosimetry of 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric-modulated arc radiotherapy (VMAT) to evaluate the best treatment option. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten consecutive patients with inoperable chest wall desmoid tumours (PTV range 416-4549 cm(3)) were selected. For each patient, 3DCRT, IMRT and VMAT plans were generated and the Conformity Index (CI), organ at risk (OAR) doses and monitor unit (MU) were evaluated. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare dose delivered to both target and OARs. RESULTS: The mean number of fields for 3DCRT and IMRT were 6.3 +/- 2.1, 7.2 +/- 1.8. The mean number of arcs for VMAT was 3.7 +/- 1.1. The mean conformity index of VMAT (0.98 +/- 0.14) was similar to that of IMRT (1.03 +/- 0.13), both of which were significantly better than 3DCRT (1.35 +/- 0.20; p = 0.005). The mean dose to lung was significantly higher for 3DCRT (11.9Gy +/- 7.9) compared to IMRT (9.4Gy +/- 5.4, p = 0.014) and VMAT (8.9Gy +/- 4.5, p = 0.017). For the 3 females, the low dose regions in the ipsilateral breast for VMAT were generally less with VMAT. IMRT plans required 1427 +/- 532 MU per fraction which was almost 4-fold higher than 3DCRT (313 +/- 112, P = 0.005). Compared to IMRT, VMAT plans required 60 % less MU (570 +/- 285, P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: For inoperable chest wall desmoid tumours, VMAT delivered equivalent target coverage when compared to IMRT but required 60 % less MU. Both VMAT and IMRT were superior to 3DCRT in terms of better PTV coverage and sparing of lung tissue."
"The objective of our study was to report head and neck deep fibromatosis as part of the differential diagnosis of a firm painful neck mass after cervical fusion and diskectomy. CONCLUSION: Although they are rare tumors, fibromatosis tumors or desmoid tumors should be considered in a patient with a painful neck mass; a history of cervical spine surgery; and MRI findings showing a large, avidly enhancing, heterogeneous mass adjacent to surgical hardware that is hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging."
Ga-PSMA PET/CT is a new imaging technique that is highly sensitive to metastatic prostate cancer lesions compared with other conventional imaging modalities. We report a case of a 77-year-old man with newly diagnosed prostate carcinoma who had a PSMA PET/CT scan for staging of his disease. An intensely PSMA-avid right pelvic mass was identified abutting the cecum and terminal ileum. Surgical removal and histopathologic examination of this lesion revealed the diagnosis of a desmoid tumor. It is important to be aware that many tumors other than prostate carcinoma may also show avid uptake on PSMA PET/CT scan.
"We experienced a rare case of pancreatic desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) in a 75-year-old Japanese woman. She was asymptomatic but routine examination including ultrasonography revealed a mass in the abdomen. For precise examination, she was referred to the regional hospital. Computed tomography showed that the mass was protruding anteriorly from the left-sided pancreas. Because of the enlargement of the mass lesion, distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy was performed after about 3 months. Macroscopically, the mass was encapsulated and approximately 8cm in diameter. Histological examination revealed that spindle or blunt stellate cells were proliferating in parallel or storiform fashion with myxoid and fibrous background. The tumor cells did not show prominent atypia and mitoses were rarely seen, suggesting that the tumor was low grade or borderline. Immunohistochemistry showed obvious nuclear staining of beta-catenin. Furthermore, analysis of beta-catenin gene revealed that the tumor had a typical missense mutation of threonine to alanine at colon 41 (T41A) in exon 3. These findings confirmed the pathological diagnosis of DTF of the pancreas. To the best of our knowledge, 18 cases of pancreatic DTF have been reported in the English literature and beta-catenin gene mutation had been examined in only one case among them. Thus, our case is the 19th pancreatic DTF and the second case with confirmed beta-catenin gene mutation."
"Desmoid fibromatosis is a locally aggressive clonal fibroblastic proliferation with high recurrence rates and no metastatic potential. Implicated molecular aberrations occur within the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway (APC and beta-catenin gene mutations). Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) are profibrotic growth factors, downstream from nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, that lead to increased fibrogenesis. CTGF (a downstream effector of TGF-beta) is a matricellular protein that modulates the activity of growth factors, adhesion molecules, integrins, and extracellular matrix thus playing a central role in tissue remodeling and fibrosis. Recently there has been growing interest in use of extracellular matrix inhibitors for treatment of various fibrogenic diseases. Desmoid fibromatosis samples (n=15) were evaluated for expression of beta-catenin, TGF-beta, and CTGF using immunohistochemistry on formalin paraffin-embedded material. A control group comprising scar tissue and adjacent normal skin (n=10) were simultaneously immunostained with above mentioned markers. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on frozen specimens of desmoid fibromatosis (n=6) and normal skin (n=2). All 15 desmoid tumors were positive for beta-catenin (surrogate marker of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway dysregulation) which was negative in control normal skin and scar samples. TGF-beta and CTGF were negative in 9 of 10 normal skin controls. TGF-beta and CTGF were positive in all cases of scar tissue. All 15 cases of desmoid tumors were positive for TGF-beta and CTGF. The real-time polymerase chain reaction showed higher expression levels of TGF-beta and CTGF in desmoid fibromatosis compared with normal skin. The high constitutive expression of beta-catenin downstream effectors; TGF-beta, CTGF has the potential for enabling targeted therapy."
"Desmoid tumors are rarely observed tumors that develop from deep muscle and aponeurotic tissues. They are histologically intermediate, and exhibit a local aggressive course. These tumors have been observed in the abdominal region, and are rarely encountered in the thoracic wall. The most effective treatment appears to be surgery. A 59-year-old female patient was admitted with the complaint of right breast pain and a palpable mass. The patient had undergone a modified radical mastectomy surgical procedure of the right breast due to invasive breast carcinoma 10 years before. A mass with a soft tissue density and a size of 44x22 mm was detected in the thoracic computed tomography of the patient, which subsequently resulted in biopsy followed by surgery. As a result of the pathological examination of the mass, the diagnosis was determined as desmoid tumor. Due to the closeness of the tumor to the surgical margin, the patient was administered radiotherapy and maintenance imatinib treatment was started."
"Desmoplastic fibroma, alternatively known as aggressive fibromatosis or desmoid tumors, occurs in the form of benign locally aggressive tumors that possess a high rate of recurrence. The forearm bones are rarely involved. The current study presents a case of desmoplastic fibroma in the distal forearm of a 23-year-old man. The tumor was widely resected, and the bone defect was reconstructed using an autologous vascularized fibular graft during the resection procedure. The patient experienced recurrence three times and underwent four resections during the subsequent 3 years following the initial resection. After 10 years of follow-up, the patient's functional recovery remains positive. Despite the implication that surgical resection may be involved in the development of aggressive fibromatosis, surgical wide local excision and functional reconstruction were recommended for the treatment of the present patient."
"Here, we present an uncommon case of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) involving the mesentery. The tumor was composed of loosely arranged round-to-spindle-shaped tumor cells with amphophilic cytoplasm in an inflammatory and myxoid background. The mitotic activity was low (1 per 50 high-power fields) and the tumor cells lacked cellular atypism. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells demonstrated strong nuclear membranous staining with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). In situ hybridization for ALK gene rearrangement revealed a splitting apart of the two signals within the tumor cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that the tumor harbored a ran-binding protein 2 (RANBP2)-ALK rearrangement. IMTs are usually characterized by epithelioid-to-round cells featuring increased mitotic activity, occasionally demonstrating unusual tumor cells and more aggressive clinical behavior. To date, 23 IMTs have been reported with RANBP2 and ALK gene rearrangements. However, the present case demonstrated indolent cytological features, leading to a difficulty in differentiating it from desmoid-type fibromatosis."
"Intestinal obstruction is a frequently encountered entity in surgical practice. The signs & symptoms, many a times, are suggestive of the level of obstruction, making the diagnosis of obstruction evident. There are various causes of intestinal obstruction which diversify to an enormous extent, stamping on the famous paradigm for the mysterious nature of the abdomen being referred to as the Pandora's Box. In accordance with the above saying, we report a rare case of a desmoid tumour, presenting as intestinal obstruction, which entices us to strongly believe the same."

"The surgical closure of secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) is frequently performed. The minimally invasive approach, currently adopted by many centers as a way to preserve aesthetic appearance, particularly in female patients, seems to be safe. We describe the case of an adolescent who developed a desmoid tumor soon after a minimally invasive operation for surgical closure of a secundum ASD."
"Adjuvant imatinib is useful in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) at high risk of recurrence. At present, the risk of recurrence is determined based on tumor size, mitotic rate, tumor site, and tumor rupture. Previous studies using various biochemical pathways identified gene expression patterns that distinguish two subsets of aggressive fibromatosis (AF), serous ovarian carcinoma (OVCA), and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). These gene sets separated soft tissue sarcomas into two groups with different probabilities of developing metastatic disease. The present study used these gene sets to identify GIST subgroups with different probabilities of developing metastatic disease. METHODS: We utilized these three gene sets, hierarchical clustering, and Kaplan-Meier analysis, to examine 60 primary resected GIST samples using Agilent chip expression profiling. RESULTS: Hierarchical clustering using both the combined and individual AF-, OVCA-, and RCC- gene sets identified differences in probabilities of developing metastatic disease between the clusters defined by the first branch point of the clustering dendrograms (p = 0.029 for the combined gene set, p = 0.003 for the AF-gene set, p < 0.001 for the OVCA-gene set, and p = 0.003 for the RCC-gene set). CONCLUSIONS: Hierarchical clustering using these gene sets identified at least two subsets of GIST with distinct clinical behavior and risk of metastatic disease. The use of gene expression analysis along with other known prognostic factors may better predict the long-term outcome following surgery, and thus restrict the use of adjuvant therapy to high-risk GIST, and reduce heterogeneity among groups in clinical trials of new drugs."
"CTNNB1 gene mutations are the molecular key events in the majority of sporadic desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF). The specific S45F mutation has been reported to be associated with a more aggressive clinical course in DF. For the current study, the CTNNB1 mutation status was analyzed in DF samples from the prospective German Interdisciplinary Sarcoma Group (GISG) phase 2 study evaluating imatinib to induce progression arrest in DF Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) progressive patients. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients were treated with a planned dose of imatinib 800 mg daily over 2 years (NCT01137916). The progression arrest rate (PAR) after 6 months of treatment was the primary endpoint of the study. CTNNB1 exon 3 mutation status was analyzed using Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Thirty-three (97 %) of 34 patients reaching the primary endpoint were evaluable for CTNNB1 mutation exon 3 status. T41A mutations accounted for 30.3 % of the study samples and S45 mutations for 48.5 %, whereas CTNNB1 wild-type status was found in 21.2 %. The respective PAR at 6 months was 70, 81, and 43 %. Patients harboring CTNNB1 mutations demonstrated a higher PAR compared to wild-type DF. There was a statistically significant difference comparing patients with S45F mutations (85 % PAR) versus wild-type status (p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Mutations at position S45 were overrepresented in the GISG-01 trial recruiting RECIST progressive patients only. The positive correlation of CTNNB1 mutation status with the progression arrest rate after imatinib therapy supports the idea of a potential predictive impact of the mutation status on DF treatment decision making."

"Desmoid tumors are benign but locally aggressive tumors of mesenchymal origin which are poorly circumscribed, infiltrate the surrounding tissue, lack a true capsule and are composed of abundant collagen. History of trauma or surgery to the site of tumor origin is elicited in up to one in four cases and they most commonly develop in the anterior abdominal wall and shoulder girdle but they can arise in any skeletal muscle. The clinical behavior and natural history of desmoid tumors are unpredictable and management is difficult with many issues remaining controversial, mainly regarding early detection, the role, type and timing of surgery and the value of non-operative therapies. We report a case of anterior abdominal wall desmoid tumor in a 40-year-old male with a previous history of surgery."
"Laparoscopic surgery is becoming the preferred technique for most colorectal interventions. This study aimed to clarify the time trend of surgical treatment for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and its relevance to clinical outcomes in Japan over a 13-year period. METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study comprising 23 specialist institutions for colorectal disease and a cohort of 282 FAP patients who underwent total colectomy or proctocolectomy during 2000-2012. Patient clinical backgrounds and surgical outcomes were compared between the first and second halves of the study period. RESULTS: The proportion of surgical types adopted over the entire study period was 46, 21, 30, and 3 % for ileoanal anastomosis (IAA), ileoanal canal anastomosis, ileorectal anastomosis, and permanent ileostomy, respectively. FAP patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery have increased since 2008 and reached 74 % in the past 3 years. In particular, the number of patients undergoing laparoscopic proctocolectomy with IAA increased approximately four-fold from the first to the second half of the study period. A laparoscopic approach was increasingly used in patients with coexisting colorectal malignancies. Despite this trend, surgical results of the laparoscopic approach between the two study periods showed similar morbidity, pouch operation and stoma closure completion rates. No postoperative mortality was observed in this series, and laparoscopic surgery was comparable to open surgery in terms of stoma closure rate, incidence of intra-abdominal/abdominal desmoid tumors, and postoperative survival rate in both study periods. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic approach is increasingly being adopted for prophylactic FAP surgery in Japan and may provide clinically acceptable practical outcomes."
"Fibromatosis is a rare benign mesenchymal neoplasm which primarily originates in the muscle, connective tissue, fascial sheaths, and musculoaponeurotic structures. It is commonly seen as abdominal tumour but in maxillofacial region, the occurrence of these tumours is very rare and exceedingly rare in infratemporal space. Often misdiagnosed due to its varied clinical behaviour, fibromatosis is benign, slow-growing, infiltrative tumour without any metastatic potential, but is locally aggressive causing organ dysfunction along with high recurrence rate. We report a case of fibromatosis involving the left infratemporal space in a 35-year-old female who presented with chief complaint of limited mouth opening for the preceding 4 years."
"A new World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumors of the Pleura has recently been published. While the histologic classification of pleural malignant mesothelioma remains the same in the 2015 WHO classification as it was in the 2004 classification, multiple new observations have been recorded. First, more detailed study has been performed of histologic subtyping of epithelioid mesothelioma. In particular, it has been recognized that the pleomorphic subtype is associated with a poor prognosis, similar to that of sarcomatoid malignant mesothelioma. Second, there is improved understanding of the role of immunohistochemistry in distinguishing mesothelioma from carcinomas of various sites. Third, the criteria for distinguishing malignant mesothelioma from reactive mesothelial proliferations has been further refined. Fourth, additional studies of sarcomatoid mesothelioma have defined the frequency and spectrum of various histologic and immunohistochemical features, including heterologous elements. Finally, pleural well-differentiated papillary mesotheliomas are better defined and cases with invasive foci are recognized. In addition, several promising observations in mesothelioma pathology and genetics have been made in the past decade. These are now the subject of further investigation to determine if they can be validated in ways that will significantly impact clinical practice. These include a preliminary study of grading, suggesting that nuclear atypia and mitotic count are independent prognostic markers. The discovery of inactivating mutations in the BRCA1-associated protein 1 gene in sporadic and hereditary mesothelioma has opened up a variety of novel molecular, clinical, and diagnostic investigations. One possible diagnostic application includes the setting of separating mesothelioma from reactive mesothelial proliferations, where it may play a role in conjunction with p16 FISH. Another useful discovery was that the NAB2-STAT6 fusion is characteristic of solitary fibrous tumors. This led to development of a STAT6 antibody that is a reliable immunohistochemical marker for solitary fibrous tumors. Genetic studies also led to the finding that WWTR1-CAMTA1 fusions are useful diagnostic markers for epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas, which can present as pleural-based masses. Finally, desmoid type fibromatosis, a locally aggressive tumor that can present in the pleura, has been shown to frequently have CTNNB1 gene mutations and express beta-catenin by immunohistochemistry."
"To characterize the clinical features of desmoid tumor, assess the efficacy of conservative chemotherapy for inoperable desmoid tumor and analyze the prognostic factors. METHODS: From August 2009 to December 2013, 52 patients with inoperable desmoid tumor were treated in our department and received chemotherapy with vinorelbine combined with low-dose methotrexate. The clinical data of the patients were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The patients studied included 22 male and 30 female patients with the age of disease onset ranging from 2 to 46 years (mean 18.7 years). The lesions occurred most frequently in the lower limbs (36.5%, 19/52) and the tumor size ranged from 2.7 to 37 cm (mean 9.5 cm). The patients were followed up for a median of 29 months (7 to 64 months). The chemotherapy lasted for 4 to 30 months (median 12 months). After completion of the chemotherapy, 1 patient had a complete response (CR), 18 showed partial responses (PR), 27 cases had stable disease (SD), and 6 had progressive disease (PD), with an overall response rate (ORR) of 88.5%. The progression-free survival (PFS) time of the patients ranged from 4 to 63 months (median 26.5 months) with a 2-year PFS rate of 76.7% and 5-year PFS rate of 41.9%. A longer chemotherapy duration (over 12 months) was associated with a more favorable prognosis. No significant differences in PFS were found between the patients stratified by gender, age of disease onset, age when receiving chemotherapy, tumor site, or tumor size. CONCLUSION: For recurrent, inoperable and progressive desmoid tumor, long enough cycles of vinorelbine combined with low-dose methotrexate can be an effective and safe option for tumor control."
"A 21-year-old woman who underwent laparoscopic total colectomy for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) 1 year 3 months previously presented with a mass larger than 10 cm around the ileostomy. Multiple tumors in the mesentery around the ileostomy and anterior to the sacrum, accompanied by bilateral hydronephrosis, were detected by computed tomography. The patient was diagnosed with intraabdominal desmoid tumors, stage according to the Church's classification. The desmoid tumor (15x9 cm) around the ileostomy was completely resected surgically, whereas another desmoid tumor (5x4 cm) was incompletely resected. We found a desmoid tumor of more than 10 cm in size and many fibromatous plaques in the mesentery. We then performed 4 courses of systemic chemotherapy with dacarbazine and doxorubicin in for the residual desmoid tumors after surgery. There was no growth of the residual desmoid tumors for 12 months after chemotherapy. Genetic tests detected a pathogenic germline mutation of the APC gene in the high-risk region of the desmoid tumor. We also confirmed somatic mutations in the resected specimens."
"The patient was a 22-year-old woman with FAP, who had undergone laparoscopic total colectomy 3 years previously. She presented to our hospital with a high fever and abdominal pain. Large hard tumors were palpated in the right lower abdomen and pelvis. Blood examination showed an inflammatory response. CT scan revealed 17 cm diameter solid tumors. At surgery, 2 tumors arising from the mesentery of the small intestine were found, neither of which invaded any organs. We performed tumor extirpation with partial resection of the duodenum, ileum, right fallopian tube and rectum. A jejunal stoma was formed, leaving a length of remnant intestine of about 120 cm. The histopathological diagnosis was given as desmoid tumor with infection. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the 9th postoperative day. Desmoid tumor is the second most common cause of death in FAP patients. Although desmoids can also occur in the extremities, most FAP patients develop intra-abdominal tumors. Despite being histologically benign, they are locally infiltrative and can cause death through invasion and destruction of adjacent vital structures and organs. Here, we report a case of desmoid tumors with FAP with reference to the literature."
"some locations are considered exceptional, like the urogenital localization. The Author point out a rare case of giant idiopathic scrotal fibromatosis that was found during an autopsy. A widower, that lived alone in poor hygienic conditions, was found dead in his house. The Judicial Authority ordered the autopsy, that was performed two days later at the Medico-Legal Section of Milan University. External examinations revealed only the considerable dimension of the scrotum (cm 24 x 41). The cause of death was fixed in a cardiac tamponade due to a natural heart laceration localized in correspondence of a transmural infarction. The toxicological exam resulted negative, while the histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis qualify the scrotal mass as a desmoids tumor. Due to the absence of predisposing conditions and of fibroproliferative infiltration in bladder and retroperitoneal space, the neoplasm was configured as an idiopathic desmoid tumor. The presented case gives the reason for the discussion concerning medico-legal aspects that are typical of rare neoplasms."
"Open surgical resection is the mainstay treatment for desmoid tumors. Laparoscopic resection is rarely used and not well described in the literature. We report a case of a single, 35-year-old woman who presented with palpable abdominal wall desmoid tumor. The patient had had laparoscopic cholecystectomy 2 years earlier, and the tumor was at the insertion site of the right upper quadrant trocar. The diagnosis was made by a Tru-Cut biopsy at another institution, after the lesion had increased in size and caused increased discomfort. The patient underwent successful laparoscopic resection of the tumor. This report aimed to promote laparoscopic resection of abdominal wall desmoid tumors, whenever feasible, and describe the laparoscopic technique. We believe this is the second case of laparoscopic excision of desmoid tumor reported in the English-language literature."
"Desmoid tumors (DTs) are rare mesenchymal neoplasms with unpredictable natural history. There is a high risk of recurrence despite adequate surgical resection, however DTs do not have the capacity to metastasize. The estimated incidence in general population is 2-4 cases/million/year. They may occur at any age but most commonly in the third and fourth decades. Both sexes may be affected, but there is a slight female predominance. DTs can occur at any body site. The exact etiology remains unclear, but trauma, hormonal disturbances, pregnancy, genetic and hereditary factors are postulated to be in association with its' development. Potential to attain large size, infiltration and destruction of adjacent vital structures and tendency to recur are main management problems and important causes of morbidity and mortality. Wide excision is standard first-line treatment of primary or recurrent symptomatic desmoids. We present case of 33-years-old Caucasian female patient admitted to hospital with 2 months history of squeezing pain in right upper quadrant which appeared after meals. The patient was in general good condition. There were no abnormalities on basic laboratory tests on admission. CT of chest revealed hydrothorax to the level of the apex of the right lung and tumor sized 7 x 13 x 13 cm located in the lower lobe of right lung. Histopathological diagnosis of desmoid tumor of right lung was formulated. We report, to our knowledge for the first time in Poland, case of aggressive fibromatosis of lung with invasion of pleura."
"Solid and cystic pancreatic neoplasms are being recognized more frequently with increasing utilization and spatial resolution of modern imaging techniques. In addition to the more common primary pancreatic solid (ductal adenocarcinoma) and cystic neoplasms of epithelial origin, nonepithelial neoplasms of the pancreas may appear as well-defined solid or cystic neoplasms. Most of these lesions have characteristic imaging features, such as a well-defined border, which allows differentiation from ductal adenocarcinoma. Solid masses include neurofibroma, ganglioneuroma, leiomyoma, lipoma, and perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa). Schwannomas and desmoid tumors can be solid or cystic. Cystic tumors include mature cystic teratoma and lymphangioma. Lipoma, PEComa, and mature cystic teratoma can contain fat, and ganglioneuroma and mature cystic teratoma may contain calcification. Although these unusual benign neoplasms are rare, the radiologist should at least consider them in the differential diagnosis of well-defined lesions of the pancreas. The goal of this comprehensive review is to improve understanding of these rare primary pancreatic mesenchymal tumors."
"Our aim is to present an utterly unique case of sporadic aggressive fibromatosis (AF), infiltrating both the abdominal wall and the colon; and especially, to discuss the usefulness of porcine dermal meshes for the reconstruction of a large parietal gap in contaminated surgery and in an emergency setting. CASE EXPERIENCE: We report the case of a 40 years old woman affected by sporadic AF, involving both the anterior abdominal wall and the colon, with an effective intestinal stricture. The surgery consisted in removing ""en bloc"" the portions of the colon and abdominal wall affected by fibromatosis, with no residual tumor (R0), that left an important parietal gap. A biological prosthesis of cross-linked acellular porcine dermal collagen (APDC) has been used for the contextual reconstruction of the abdominal wall, sutured inlay by a double line of non absorbable stitches. No complications have been observed. After one year follow up, there is no tumour recurrence and the abdominal wall has fully consolidated. DISCUSSION: The peculiar problems arising about differential diagnosis, therapeutic indications and reconstructive surgical procedures are discussed, especially with regard to prosthetic implants in contaminated surgery and to cross-linked APDC prosthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Complete surgical removal is the first line treatment in sporadic AF, whenever feasible. In the reported case, an R0 resection was obtained at the cost of a wide parietal gap. According to our experience, cross-linked APDC is effective for the prosthetic reconstruction of abdominal wall in contaminated surgery and in an emergency setting. KEY WORDS: Abdominal wall, Aggressive fibromatosis, Desmoid tumor, Prosthetic devices, Reconstructive surgical procedures, desmoid tumor."
"Desmoid tumors are relatively uncommon tumors, and those occurring sporadically and in an intraabdominal location are especially rare. Although desmoid tumors have a benign histologic appearance and lack the ability to metastasize, they can invade locally, often aggressively, grow to large sizes, and recur repeatedly. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a symptomatic, giant mesenteric desmoid tumor discovered incidentally during workup for the patient's previous history of lung cancer. The patient elected to undergo palliative resection of the tumor because of persistent and unrelenting abdominal pain. CONCLUSION: Because of the rarity of the disease, no clear evidence-based guidelines exist for the treatment of sporadic mesenteric desmoid tumors. Review of the available literature suggests that surgical resection with negative margins is a reasonable approach for patients with symptomatic tumors."
"Radiation-induced sarcoma is a long-term complication of radiation therapy. The most common secondary neoplasia is the undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, which is usually described in the deep soft tissue of the trunk or extremities. Radiation-induced sarcomas have a poor prognosis. An early diagnosis and management are needed to improve the survival rate of such patients. We presently report a case of a radiation-induced undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma of the left gluteus maximus muscle, which developed 25 years after an initial diagnosis of aggressive fibromatosis and 21 years after a tumour recurrence. This case study illustrates the risk of developing a sarcoma in a radiation field and the need for long-term follow-up after radiation therapy. Unnecessary radiation therapy, in particular in the case of benign conditions in young patients, should be avoided."
"Extra-abdominal fibromatosis is a rare, benign disease that is characterized by a local but not metastatic invasivity. In particular, desmoid tumors of the chest wall represent only 10-20% of all deep fibromatoses. The disease occurs more often in females and has a higher incidence between puberty and the fourth decade of life. The present study reports the case of a 34-year-old female who came to our attention due to a voluminous mass in the right subcostal region. The magnetic resonance imaging of the upper abdomen confirmed the presence of a neoplasm localized between the anterior hepatic margin and the right costal plane. Through a right subcostal laparotomy, the voluminous 95x45x94-mm neoplasm was excised. Histological examination showed evidence consistent with extra-abdominal fibromatosis. The patient has not shown recurrence of the disease for 4 years since the surgery. Overall, radical surgery with disease-free resection margins is the prime treatment option for this disease. Other therapeutic options, such as radiotherapy, hormonal therapy or treatment with imatinib mesylate, can also be considered in certain cases."
"We describe a case of intra-abdominal fibromatosis, which occurred in a 44-year-old woman who had a previous history of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) of the sigmoid mesocolon, which was treated with imatinib and resection. A mass was detected at the site of ileocolic anastomosis of the previous small bowel resection and sigmoid colectomy, nearly 3 years later. Clinically, this was suspected to represent recurrent GIST and was excised, but histology and mutational analysis showed desmoid-type fibromatosis with a mutation in codon 41 of exon 3 of the CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) gene. The occurrence of fibromatosis at the site of excision of GIST is very rare, but its recognition is important as the treatment of the two neoplasms differs significantly. As imaging cannot reliably distinguish between these 2 entities, histological diagnosis is crucial for correct clinical management."
"Elastofibroma is a rare benign fibroelastic tumor. CASE: We report a case of a 44-year-old woman, operated 4 months ago for a left infrascapular desmoid tumor and presented for bilateral mass of the left suprascapular and right infrascapular regions which were surgically resected. The diagnosis of elastofibroma was made and also confirmed for the left infrascapular desmoid tumor. Six months later, she presented an asymptomatic left infrascapular recurrence. Monitoring was continued and the patient is still asymptomatic after 24 months. DISCUSSION: We highlight the importance of imaging features understanding in order to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary surgical resection."
"Desmoids are benign tumours originating from connective tissue. Their uncontrolled growth can threaten organ function, especially in the abdominal location, when presenting as mesenteric fibromatosis. There have been only a few case reports of the coexistence of mesenteric fibromatosis and Crohn's disease. All of them were in adults, mostly with potential risk factors for desmoid tumours including female sex, oestrogen intake and abdominal surgery. We present, to our knowledge, the first paediatric case of the coexistence of both conditions. A 15 -year -old boy was operated on due to an obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract. Preoperative radiological examination suggested a tumour causing intussusception. Intraoperatively, a tumour and a significant length of infiltrated ileum were resected. Histopathological examination confirmed a desmoid tumour in the course of mesenteric fibromatosis and Crohn's disease. The patient has been treated pharmacologically since. Further research is needed to explain their origin and simultaneous appearance in children."
"Desmoid fibromatosis is a rare but locally aggressive tumor comprised of myofibroblasts. Desmoids do not have the ability to metastasize but can cause significant morbidity and mortality by local invasion. These tumors may occur throughout the body, but are commonly found on the abdominal wall and within the intestinal mesentery. Desmoids in these areas may cause unique clinical problems for physicians and patients. Mutations in either the beta-catenin or the APC genes are usually the cause for the development of these tumors with the former comprising the sporadic development of tumors and the latter being associated with familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome. Surgical resection with histologically negative margins has been the cornerstone of therapy for this disease, but this paradigm has begun to shift. It is now common to accept a microscopically positive margin after resection as recurrence rates may not be significantly affected. An even more radical evolution in management has been the recent movement towards ""watchful waiting"" when new desmoids are diagnosed. As the natural history of desmoids has become better understood, it is evident that some tumors will not grow and may even spontaneously regress sparing patients the morbidity of more aggressive therapy. Other modalities of treatment for desmoids include radiation and systemic therapy which both can be used adjuvantly or as definitive therapy and have shown durable response rates as single therapy regimens. The decision to use radiation and/or systemic therapies is often based on tumor biology, tumor location, surgical morbidity, and patient preference. Systemic therapy options have increased to include hormonal therapies, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and chemotherapy, as well as targeted therapies. Unfortunately, the rarity of this disease has resulted in a scarcity of randomized trials to evaluate any of these therapies emphasizing the need for this disease to be treated at high volume multidisciplinary institutions."
"Desmoid tumors (DTs) are a group of rare and benign soft tissue tumors that result from monoclonal proliferation of well-differentiated fibroblasts. Since DTs tend to infiltrate and compress adjacent structures, the location of DTs is one of the most crucial factors for determining the severity of the disease. Furthermore, DTs can further complicate the clinical course of patients when the growth is remarkably rapid, especially for DTs occurring in anatomically critical compartments, including the thoracic cavity.The authors report a case of a 71-year-old man with a known mediastinal mass incidentally detected 4 months ago, presenting dyspnea with right-sided atelectasis and massive pleural effusion. Imaging studies revealed a 16.4 x 9.4-cm fibrous mass with high glucose metabolism in the anterior mediastinum. The mass infiltrated into the chest wall and also displaced the mediastinum contralaterally. Interestingly, the tumor had an extremely rapid doubling time of 31.3 days.En bloc resection of the tumor was performed as a curative as well as a diagnostic measure. Histopathologic examination showed spindle cells with low cellularity and high collagen deposition in the stroma. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for nuclear beta-catenin. Based on these pathologic findings, the mass was diagnosed as DT. After surgery, there has been no evidence of recurrence of disease in the patient.This patient presents a mediastinal DT with extremely rapid growth. Notably, the doubling time of DT in our case was the shortest among reported cases of DT. Our experience also highlights the benefits of early interventional strategy, especially for rapidly growing DTs in the thoracic cavity."
"Desmoid tumors are benign mesenchymal neoplasms with a locally aggressive nature. The mutational status of beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1) is presumed to affect the tumorous activity of the cells. In this study, we isolated three kinds of desmoid cell with different CTNNB1 status, and compared their characteristics. Cells were isolated from three patients with abdominal wall desmoid during surgery, all of which were resistant to meloxicam treatment. The mutational status of the CTNNB1 exon 3 was determined for both parental tumor tissues and isolated cultured cells. beta-catenin expression was determined with immunohistochemistry. Responsiveness to meloxicam was investigated with MTS assay together with COX-2 immunostaining. mRNA expressions of downstream molecules of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway were determined with real-time RT-PCR. Three kinds of cell isolated from desmoid tumors harboring different CTNNB1 mutation status (wild type, T41A, and S45F), all exhibited a spindle shape. These isolated cells could be cultured until the 20th passage with unchanged proliferative activity. Nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin was observed in all cultured cells, particularly in those with S45F. Proliferating activity was significantly suppressed by meloxicam (25 mumol/L, P < 0.007) in all three cell cultures, of which parental desmoid was resistant to meloxicam clinically. The mRNA expressions of Axin2, c-Myc, and Cyclin D1 differently increased in the three cultured cell types as compared with those in human skin fibroblast cells (HDF). Inhibitors of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway downregulated Axin2, c-Myc, and Cyclin D1 significantly. Isolated and cultured desmoid tumor cells harboring any one of the CTNNB1 mutation status had unique characteristics, and could be useful to investigate desmoid tumors with different mutation status of CTNNB1."
"An 81-year-old man initially presented with a right forearm mass that was found to be myxofibrosarcoma. In addition, he was found to have gastric and intragastric masses identified as neuroendocrine tumor (NET) and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST; presenting synchronously), respectively, as well as a new left upper quadrant mass identified as desmoid tumor in the colon. The patient complained of melena, which was found to be due to metastatic myxofibrosarcoma in the transverse colon. Several reports have associated GIST with NET and some reports have associated GIST with sarcomas and NET with sarcomas; however, this is the first report to document all these tumors in a single patient. Several factors may have contributed to the development of these tumors, including growth factors secreted by NET, KIT mutation of GIST predisposing to additional tumors, immunosuppressed state, or an underlying genetic syndrome. This case highlights the importance of investigating for additional malignancies when a primary malignancy is discovered."
"Desmoid type fibromatosis (DT) is a rare lesion of unclear pathogenesis that most often presents a mutation of the (beta-catenin) gene. The natural history and clinical evolution are highly variable between patients and to date there is no consensus on optimal therapy. We report two cases of a patient with multiple DT lesions. Molecular investigations performed in both patients on multiple tumors at different anatomical sites revealed non-identical CTNNB1 mutations. The first patient was a 39-year-old man with a history of recurrent DT. In two of the DT lesions, three different mutations were found in codons 41 and 45, respectively. The lesions showed marked inflammatory features, characterized by IgG4 positive lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates and a foreign body reaction, which increased in intensity over time. The patient was eventually treated with a COX-2 inhibitor and the remaining mass was stabilized. In the two DT lesions of the second patient, CTNNB1 mutations S45P and T41A were found. The presence of different mutations in multiple focally recurrent sporadic DT lesions indicates that they do not have a clonal relationship. Our data suggest that a CTNNB1 mutation is a necessary event probably by providing a selective growth advantage. An IgG4 host antigen response is discussed as a potential predisposing factor for one of the patients."

"The prevalence of desmoid tumors among patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is at least 10%, and the prevalence of FAP among desmoid patients varies between 7.5-16%. METHODS: Data included 106 desmoid patients identified from the database of the Department of Pathology, Helsinki University Hospital, years 2000-2012. We evaluated the risk of FAP among patients by using endoscopy and we identified individuals with attenuated FAP by APC gene mutation test. We compared sporadic desmoid patients' and FAP patients' clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Ten of 106 patients already had FAP diagnosis before the desmoid. Eleven patients had had FAP screening already earlier due to desmoid and three of them were found to have FAP. Total of 52 patients participated into prospective screening of FAP. No new cases of FAP were found. The risk of FAP among desmoid tumor patients was 4.8%. In the FAP desmoid group, there were more males and patients were younger than in the sporadic group. Intra-abdominal desmoids were more common in the FAP group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with desmoid carry an elevated risk of FAP and therefore screening is indicated. Asymptomatic patients with desmoid situated in extra truncal region may not need to be screened."
"beta-catenin (CTNNB1) is a key regulatory molecule of the Wnt signaling pathway, which is important for tissue homeostasis and regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and function. Abnormal stabilization and nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin as a consequence of missense mutations or alternative molecular mechanisms occurs at a high frequency in a variety of epithelial cancers. In mesenchymal neoplasia, the role of beta-catenin has been traditionally considered limited to desmoid-type fibromatosis. However, the spectrum of beta-catenin-driven (beta-catenin-altered) neoplasia of mesenchymal origin has been steadily widening to include, in addition to desmoid tumors, a variety of benign and intermediate-biology neoplasms of soft tissue (intranodal palisaded myofibroblastoma), head and neck (juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma and sinonasal hemangiopericytoma/glomangiopericytoma), and ovarian (microcystic stromal tumor) origin. In addition, several old and newly reported distinctive site-specific beta-catenin-driven parenchymal neoplasms of uncertain histogenesis have been well characterized in recent studies, including solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas and its recently described ovarian counterpart, sclerosing hemangioma of lung and calcifying nested stromal-epithelial tumor of the liver. This review addresses the most relevant pathobiological and differential diagnostic aspects of beta-catenin-altered neoplasms with emphasis on site-specific histologic and biological variations. In addition, the morphologic overlap and analogy as well as distinctness between these uncommon tumors will be presented and discussed. Furthermore, a note is made on association of some of these lesions with hereditary tumor syndromes, in particular with the familial adenomatous polyposis coli."
"Desmoid tumors are rare benign monoclonal fibroblastic tumors. Their aggressiveness is local with no potential for metastasis or dedifferentiation. Here we report on a 61-year-old patient who presented a locally advanced breast desmoid tumor diagnosed 20 years after post-operative radiotherapy for breast carcinoma. After 2 years of medical treatment, a high-grade undifferentiated pleomorphic soft tissue sarcoma arose within the desmoid tumor. Despite extensive surgery removing both tumors, the patient showed locoregional relapse by the sarcoma, followed by multimetastatic progression, then death 25 months after the surgery. The arising of a soft tissue sarcoma in a desmoid tumor is an exceptional event since our case is the fourth one reported so far in literature. It reinforces the need for timely and accurate diagnosis when a new mass develops in the region of a preexisting desmoid tumor, and more generally when a desmoid tumor modifies its clinical or radiological aspect."
"Desmoplastic fibroma (DF) is a benign intra-osseous neoplasm, that is, recognized as the intra-osseous counterpart of soft tissue fibromatosis in both gnathic and extra-gnathic sites. It has a propensity for locally aggressive behavior and local recurrence. An occurrence of intra-osseous lesion other than that of odontogenic origin is rare in the jaws. In this case report, we define the clinico-pathological and radiographic features of DF of the mandible in a 35-year-old female, who presented to the Outpatient Department with a 3-year history of a slowly expanding painless mass in the left mandibular posterior region. Thus, we present a classic case of DF exhibiting characteristic features along with a review of the literature."
"Many patients affected by desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) are treated with a course of hormonal therapy as front line. So far, tamoxifene has been the preferred choice. Toremifene is an anti-oestrogen agent, but possible further mechanisms of action in desmoids are related to its role in regulation of transforming growth factor-beta and beta-catenin pathways. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients treated with toremifene between 2005 and 2012 at a reference institution. Indication to toremifene was radiologically progressive disease and/or symptomatic deterioration. Progression-free survival (PFS), clinical benefit (CB) and safety profile were analysed. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were treated with toremifene 180 mg daily, 20 for radiological progression, 16 for pain and 8 for both. In 28 patients, toremifene was offered as front-line therapy, while in 11 after tamoxifen failure. PFS was 89.6% at 2 years. According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours, partial response, stable disease and disease progression were observed in 25%, 65% and 10% of the patients, respectively. Symptomatic relief was obtained in 75% of patients. Median time to response was 4 months. Overall CB was 86%. Adverse events G>/=2 according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria were recorded in ten patients. DISCUSSION: Present series provides evidence to make toremifene an option in patients with DF, even after failure on different hormonal agents. A prospective trial is ongoing to confirm these results."
"To determine the association of MRI features of extra-abdominal desmoid tumours (DTs) with prognosis. METHODS: MRIs for 90 patients with DT were retrospectively reviewed for imaging features associated with biological behaviour. The primary end point was progression (for lesions managed with chemotherapy, radiation therapy and observation) or recurrence (following surgery). Time to event was studied using univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models when accounting for demographic, clinicopathological and imaging variables. Kaplan-Meier plots were used to estimate event-free rate (EFR). RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed a significant relationship between EFR and treatment, location and compartment of origin [subcutaneous (SC), superficial fascial, intramuscular (IM) and deep fascial/intermuscular]. None of the imaging features commonly associated with biological behaviour of DTs (e.g., shape, enhancement, T2 signal etc.) or surgical margins (in surgical cases) was associated with EFR. Multivariate analysis showed that treatment modality and compartment of origin were independent predictors of EFR. Superficial and deep fascial lesions had a significantly worse EFR as a group [hazard ratio: 3.9; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.83-8.32; p = 0.0004] than did the SC and IM lesions as a group. 5-year EFR for the fascial lesions was 18% (95% CI: 6-36%), compared with 57% (95% CI: 25-79%) for the SC and IM groups. CONCLUSION: Intramuscular or SC DTs may be associated with improved prognosis. If validated on multireader and prospective studies, these results can provide for rapid risk stratification at the time of initial MRI. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This work has shown that imaging features commonly associated with biological activity of desmoid tumours (e.g. shape, T2 signal and enhancement) do not appear to be associated with prognosis in patients undergoing a variety of treatment modalities. The compartment of origin of the lesion, which can be determined on pre-operative MRI, was shown to be associated with prognosis and can allow for risk stratification in patients with DTs."
"reactive, benign, and malignant. Patients diagnosed with benign and malignant tumor/tumor-like lesions that had spindle cell components following the histopathological examination were included in the study. The patients' medical records were accessed to obtain the clinical history, follow-up notes, and radiological findings. Following histopathological, immunohistochemical, and clinical evaluations, the patients were diagnosed as follows: pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH), bilateral desmoid-type fibromatosis (FM), adenomyoepithelioma (AME), myofibroblastoma (MFB), malignant phyllodes tumor (MF), high-grade AS, post-chemotherapy osteosarcoma (OS) + Paget's disease, and metaplastic carcinoma (MC). An algorithmic approach should be used in the diagnosis; cellular structure, presence and grade of atypia, growth pattern, mitotic activity, immunohistochemical staining, and clinical and radiological features should be evaluated together. Detection of some molecular changes can be useful in differential diagnosis."
"Fibromatosis is a rare, noninvasive but aggressive tumor. The tumor displaces tissue by ""pushing"" the normal structures aside. Optimal treatment should be individualized. CASE: A 35-year-old woman presented with a recurrent fibromatosis, which filled the vagina and extended into the pelvis. The classical surgical removal would have had a high morbidity. Therefore, it was decided, after shared decision-making, to opt for treatment with interferon. The side effects of the therapy were tolerable, and a complete regression of the fibromatosis was achieved. At present, 13 years after the diagnosis and 7 years after discontinuation of the therapy, the patient is well with no signs of disease. CONCLUSION: Interferon may be considered as primary treatment for extensive pelvic fibromatosis."
"To provide guidelines for clinical practice from the French College of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians (CNGOF), based on the best evidence available, concerning rare benign breast tumors: Abrikossoff (granular cell tumor), erosive adenomatosis of the nipple, cytosteatonecrosis, fibromatosis (desmoid tumor), galactocele, hamartoma, hemangioma, lipoma, juvenile papillomatosis, pseudoangiomatous hyperplasia, and syringomatous adenoma. METHODS: Bibliographical search in French and English languages by consultation of Pubmed, Cochrane and international databases. RESULTS: For erosive adenomatosis of the nipple, surgical excision is recommended to exclude Paget's disease or cancer (grade C). When surgery is performed for breast desmoid tumor or syringomatous adenoma, free margins are recommended (grade C). Without clinico-radio-histologic discordance, surgical abstention may be proposed for Abrikossoff tumor (granular cell tumor), cytosteatonecrosis, galactocele, hamartoma, hemangioma, lipoma, juvenile papillomatosis, pseudoangiomatous hyperplasia, and syringomatous adenoma (grade C)."
"Desmoid tumors are a rare group of locally aggressive, non malignant tumors of fibroblastic origin that can lead to significant morbidity due to local invasion and may even result in a fatal outcome when located around vital organs. Their clinical presentation, biological behavior and natural history can be quite varied and is incompletely understood at the present time. The optimal therapeutic approach depends on various factors, and a multidisciplinary approach is necessary to achieve local control with acceptable morbidity. Despite progress in the understanding of these tumors and the treatment options, local recurrence remains a major problem."
"11/11 leiomyosarcomas, 8/11 pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcomas, 9/39 sarcomatoid carcinomas, 7/7 desmoid tumors, 1/3 endometrial stromal sarcomas, and 1/2 malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that p16 is highly sensitive for retroperitoneal DDL. However, the lack of specificity limits the diagnostic utility compared with the more established markers MDM2 and CDK4."
"Abdominal wall desmoid tumours (DT) are rare, slow-growing benign muscular-aponeurotic fibrous tumours with the tendency to locally invade and recur. They constitute 0.03% of all neoplasms and high infiltration and recurrence rate, but there is no metastatic potential. Although surgery is the primary treatment modality, the optimal treatment remains unclear. Abdominal wall endometriosis is also an unusual disease, and preoperative clinical diagnosis is not always easy. The preoperative radiologic imaging modalities may not aid all the time. Herein, we report an abdominal mass presenting as cyclic pain. Forty-two years old woman who gave birth by cesarean section admitted the complaints of painful abdominal mass (78x45 mm in size) under her cesarean incision scar. She had severe pain, particularly during menstruation. The clinical and radiological imaging findings mimicking endometrioma. We performed wide surgical excision of mass with a 1 cm tumor-free margin with the diagnosis of a benign mesenchymal tumor in the frozen section. The postoperative course was uneventful and recovered without any complication and recurrence three years after surgery. This report presents a case of abdominal wall desmoid tumor mimicking endometrioma. In this paper, shortcomings in diagnosis, abdominal wall endometriomas, and DTs were discussed in the view of literature."
"A 71-year-old man with a right renal tumor underwent nephrectomy. The procedure was converted from laparoscopy to open surgery due to profound bleeding from the renal vein. Pathological diagnosis was clear cell carcinoma G2pT3b v1 ly1 INFalpha. Three years after surgery, a 5 cm tumor in the abdominal wall was found on computed tomography (CT). A mild uptake was shown on positron emission tomography/CT and as the tumor was located near the surgical wound, recurrence of the renal cell carcinoma was suspected. However, desmoid tumor was suggested by the pathological examination of the tumor biopsy. En-bloc resection of the mass was carried out and the pathological examination showed an array of proliferating and tangling atypical spindle-shaped tumor cells. Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor cells was positive for vimentin, but negative for CD34, c-kit, and s100. Pathological diagnosis was desmoid tumor. There has been no recurrence so far. Desmoid tumor, despite its extremely low incidence, should be considered in a postoperative neoplasm."

"Desmoid tumors, or aggressive fibromatosis, are rare, locally infiltrative neoplasms caused by mutations that activate beta-catenin. Although these tumors do not metastasize, they are difficult to manage due to variability in tumor presentation and behavior. A variety of treatment options exist, including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, isolated limb perfusion, cryoablation and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Treatment-induced morbidity and poor local control rates, combined with spontaneous stabilization of some desmoid tumors, have allowed watchful waiting to recently emerge as a front-line management option. This has emphasized the need to better understand tumor behavior in order to differentiate between tumors that may stabilize and those that may progress. Here, we review the most recent findings in desmoid tumor biology and treatment options for this enigmatic disease."
"A 78-year-old man underwent laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy for gastric cancer (pT3N0M0). Multiple port sites were used, including a 10 mm port for a videoscope at the umbilical point and three other working ports. During the six-month follow-up evaluation, a 2 cm enhancing mass confined to the muscle layer was found 12 mm from the right lower quadrant port site, suggesting a metastatic or desmoid tumor. Follow-up computed tomography imaging two months later showed that the mass had increased in size to 3.5 cm. We confirmed that there was no intra-abdominal metastasis by diagnostic laparoscopy and then performed a wide resection of the recurrent mass. The histologic findings revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, suggesting a metastatic mass from the stomach cancer. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient completed adjuvant chemotherapy with TS-1 (tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil potassium). There was no evidence of tumor recurrence during the 50-month follow-up period."
"A young Indian female presented with a recurring tumor in the right breast masquerading as phyllodes tumor. Patient had history of five times excision and recurrences of the tumor, diagnosed as fibrous phyllodes of the breast. Presently, a well-circumscribed tumor of about 10 cm size, comprising of benign fibrous-angiomatous tissue with evidence of foci of pyogenic vasculitis was observed. Immuno-histochemical markers for the myo-epithelial and epithelial elements excluded the possibility of fibrous phyllodes, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, desmoid fibromatosis, and metaplastic carcinoma. The present findings were diagnostic of an inflammatory angio-fibroma of the right breast, not reported in the earlier literature. The observations indicated that the female breast may be susceptible to spontaneous productive and common-antibiotic-resistant focal septic vascular inflammation giving rise to angio-fibromatous proliferation producing a well-defined tumor mass in the breast, distinguishable from the other breast lesions by the connective tissue stains and immuno-histochemical markers."
"Fibromatosis is a benign lesion, which originates from proliferating fibroblasts. Although fibromatosis is a benign tumor, it is locally aggressive and invasive. Spinal presentation of fibromatosis is very rare, and case reports are the only source of the clinical knowledge. Herein, we describe the oldest patient having spinal fibromatosis with de novo occurrence and aggressive nature. A 68-year-old female patient admitted to our outpatient clinic with low back pain and neurological claudication. On lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging, she had spinal canal stenosis with a concomitant lesion in the left longissimus muscle. We did our best to resect the tumor, entirely. The pathology result was consistent with spindle cell lesion. The lesion recurred 6 months after the primary surgery. In the second surgery, we did en bloc resection. Pathology and immunohistochemical analysis results were consistent with fibromatosis. After the second surgery, she had adjuvant radiotherapy. There was nothing other than radionecrosis in the operation site, still after 2 years. In conclusion, radiological work-up is usually insufficient to make fibromatosis diagnosis and whole pathological specimen should be carefully evaluated to achieve the accurate diagnosis. Spinal fibromatosis is very rare and its treatment methods have not universally been conceptualized. However, adjuvant therapies are necessary after en bloc resection."
"Extensive primary resections or redos may produce significant chest wall defects requiring creative reconstructions in order to avoid reduction of the intrathoracic volume. We describe the successful use of an innovative technique for chest wall reconstruction based on the concept of roof coverage of sport arenas. In fact, titanium plates are anchored to the residual rib stumps along the parasternal and paravertebral lines. The acellular collagen matrix prosthesis was sutured to the free edges of the same titanium plates to create a roof, reproducing the chest wall dome geometric configuration. A 36-year-old female patient was diagnosed with an extensive desmoid tumor involving the lateral segments of second to fifth ribs on the right side. The arena roof technique allowed for adequate expansion of the uninvolved lung and optimal chest wall functional recovery."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a rare, highly infiltrative, locally destructive neoplasm that does not metastasize, but recurs often after primary surgery. Activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is the pathogenic mechanism, caused by an activating mutation in exon 3 of CTNNB1 (85% of the sporadic patients). Radiotherapy is a frequent treatment modality with a local control rate of approximately 80%. In very rare cases, this may result in the development of radiation-induced sarcoma. It is unclear whether these sarcomas develop from the primary tumor or arise de novo in normal tissue. In 4 tertiary referral centers for sarcoma, 6 cases of desmoid-type fibromatosis that subsequently developed sarcoma after radiotherapy were collected. The DNA sequence of CTNNB1 exon 3 in the desmoid-type fibromatosis and the subsequent postradiation sarcoma was determined. Sarcomas developed 5 to 21 years after the diagnosis of desmoid-type fibromatosis and included 2 osteosarcomas, 2 high-grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas, 1 fibrosarcoma, and 1 undifferentiated spindle cell sarcoma. Three patients showed a CTNNB1 hotspot mutation (T41A, S45F, or S45N) in both the desmoid-type fibromatosis and the radiation-induced sarcoma. The other 3 patients showed a CTNNB1 mutation in the original desmoid-type fibromatosis (2 with a T41A and 1 with an S45F mutation), which was absent in the sarcoma. In conclusion, postradiation sarcomas that occur in the treatment area of desmoid-type fibromatosis are extremely rare and can arise through malignant transformation of CTNNB1-mutated desmoid fibromatosis cells, but may also originate from CTNNB1 wild-type normal cells lying in the radiation field."
"group 1 with recurrence or progression, and group 2 with no recurrence or stable without treatment. Median age at diagnosis of the tumors was 45 years, range 4 to 96, female-to-male ratio 1.8. Median tumor long diameter was 65 mm (range, 22-126 mm). The most common locations were chest wall (42.6%), followed by supraclavicular area, shoulder or axillary area, and mediastinum. The tumors had well-defined margins (83.0%), lobulated in contours (66.0%) surrounding fat (63.8%), extra-compartment extensions (42.6%), bone involvements (42.6%), and neurovascular involvements (27.7%). On CT, tumors had low attenuation (60.0%) with mild enhancement (median 24 HU, range 0-52). On MR, they showed iso-signal intensity (SI) (96.9%) on T1-weighted images (WI), and high SI (90.6%) on T2WI images, with strong (87.5%) and heterogeneous (96.9%) enhancement. Internal low signal bands (84.4%) and signal voids (68.8%) were noted. The median value of maxSUV was 3.1 (range, 2.0-7.3). In group 1 (n = 19, 40.4%), 13 patients suffered recurrence and 6 experienced progression. Group 2 (n = 28, 59.6%) consisted of 21 patients with no recurrence and 7 stable patients receiving no treatment. Partially ill-defined margins (OR, 0.167; 95% CI 0.029-0.943; P = 0.043) was the independent predictor for recurrence or progression of tumor. Knowledge of the radiological findings in desmoid-type fibromatosis on CT, MR, and FDG PET may help to improve diagnosis. Tumors with partially ill-defined margins have a tendency to recur or progress."

"Desmoid tumors (DT) represent a group of rare, distinct lesions. There are few published studies examining outcomes and safety of complex reconstruction after DT resection. METHODS: A retrospective review identified 39 patients who underwent surgical treatment of DT at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital over a 12-year period. A systematic review of the literature identified 17 further studies for inclusion. Treatment characteristics were analyzed. RESULT: Thirty-nine patients were treated during the study period, with a total number of 67 resections. Median age was 12.2 years; 49% of patients were male, and 51% were female. Median tumor size was 9.8 cm. DT most commonly arose in the extremities (40%), thorax (23%), head and neck (21%), and trunk (16%). One- and 5-year recurrence-free survival were 97.1% and 73.1%, respectively. The majority of defects were closed primarily, with the exception of head and neck defects. Long-term outcomes were good for chest, abdomen, and upper extremity defects, but were problematic for head and neck, breast, and lower extremity defects. There were no recurrences at the site of flap harvest in either the study population or in reviewed studies. CONCLUSION: For patients with DT, surgical extirpation should not come at the expense of functional preservation, as overall survival is excellent. However, specific defects, including those of the lower extremity, breast, and head and neck, will benefit from improved techniques for resection and reconstruction."
"This study aims at identifying the risk factors for the development of pre-cancerous pouch and/or cuff adenomas post ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) in familial adenomatous polyposis patients. METHOD: We retrospectively studied 59 patients operated at a single medical center during a 26-year period. Data on the timing and location of adenoma recurrence were recorded and possible correlations with patients' gender, age, presence of desmoid tumor, duodenal adenomas, type of anastomosis and number of operation stages were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-five (59%) patients had at least one adenoma in either the cuff or the pouch, including 20 with isolated cuff adenomas, 4 with isolated pouch adenomas and 11 patients with adenomas in both the pouch and cuff. There was no significant correlation between gender, age at surgery, type of anastomosis, number of operative stages and the development of pouch or cuff adenomas. Desmoid tumor and pouch adenomas were significantly correlated with cuff adenomas formation. Duodenal adenomas were associated with pouch adenomas. There was some relationship between the development of cuff adenomas and the burden of colonic polyps, as well as the presence of duodenal adenomas. CONCLUSION: Adenomas in both the pouch and cuff commonly occur following IPAA, mandating lifelong annual endoscopic surveillance."
"To describe the imaging characteristics of superficial desmoid tumors using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high-resolution sonography (HRUS). METHODS: We retrospectively examined 18 patients (12 females and 6 males) with histologically proven superficial desmoids. Fourteen patients received MRI examinations, while 12 patients were examined with HRUS. The lesions were assessed with regard to location, muscular fascia involvement, and spread into the subcutaneous fatty tissue septa, adjacent muscle, and bone. In addition, size, shape, signal intensity/echogenicity relative to muscle, amount of collagen components, Doppler vascularity on HRUS and the degree of contrast enhancement in MRI were evaluated. RESULTS: Altogether there were 20 subcutaneous lesions: six involved the chest wall and the breasts, five the hip, four each the shoulder and the flank, and one the abdominal wall. All but three lesions showed a stellar-type configuration with multiple irregular sun-burst-like extensions along the fascial planes and septa of the subcutaneous fat tissue. The extensions spread away from the main tumor focus, and in nine lesions, these extensions reached the cutis. The remaining three lesions had a spindle shape and also presented extensions along the fascial planes. Another imaging feature in all lesions was the presence of variable amounts of collagen components, with typical low signal on MRI and/or fibrillar hyperechoic appearance in HRUS. CONCLUSION: The distinctive imaging features of collagen components associated with sun-burst-like extensions in our sample of superficial desmoids are valuable diagnostic clues in the challenging non-invasive differential diagnosis of these tumors."
"Desmoid tumors (DTs) are rare mesenchymal lesions that can recur repeatedly. When it is feasible, DTs are surgically resected; however, this often results in high recurrence rates. Recently, treatment with PF-03084014, a potent gamma-secretase inhibitor, has been shown to have antitumor activity in several tumor types by affecting the WNT/beta-catenin pathway. Consequently, Notch pathway inhibition by PF-03084014 might be a promising approach for DT treatment. METHODS: The expression of Notch pathway components was analyzed in DT tissues and cell strains with immunohistochemistry and Western blotting, respectively. A panel of DT cell strains was exposed to PF-03084014 and evaluated for cell proliferation. Antitumor effects were assessed via cell cycle, apoptosis, and migration and invasion analysis. Cells treated with PF-03084014 were characterized with a gene array analysis combined with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that Notch pathway components were expressed at different levels in DTs. Hes1 (Hes Family BHLH Transcription Factor 1) was overexpressed in DT tumors versus dermal scar tissue, and PF-03084014 caused significant decreases in Notch intracellular domain and Hes1 expression in DT cell strains. PF-03084014 decreased DT cell migration and invasion and also caused cell growth inhibition in DT cell strains, most likely through cell cycle arrest. Gene array analysis combined with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showed that Wnt1-inducible signaling pathway protein 2 possibly regulated Notch and WNT pathways after treatment with PF-03084014 through integrin. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the Notch pathway is an important DT therapeutic target. Furthermore, PF-03084014 has significant antitumor activity against DTs, and it may be an alternative strategy for DT treatment."

"Noninflammatory masses in the ischiorectal fossa are rare. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to review our experience with ischiorectal fossa tumors and to address the question of whether percutaneous biopsy should be undertaken. DESIGN: This is a retrospective study. SETTINGS: This study was conducted at a tertiary institution. PATIENTS: From April 2007 to November 2014, all consecutive ischiorectal fossa masses treated in a referral center were retrospectively reviewed. They were all presented and discussed in a multidisciplinary team meeting. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in all the patients. Inflammatory pathologies, such as abscess, were excluded from the analysis. INTERVENTIONS: Percutaneous biopsy and surgical excision of ischiorectal fossa tumors were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Perioperative, pathological, and oncological outcomes were measured. RESULTS: Eleven patients were identified (8 female; median age, 50 years; range, 25-90). Percutaneous biopsy was undertaken in 8 patients. All biopsies were diagnostic and altered preoperative management in 3 cases (aggressive angiomyxoma (n = 2), desmoid fibromatosis (n = 1)). Overall final diagnosis was benign in 3 patients, locally aggressive neoplasm in 3, and malignant in 5 cases (leiomyosarcomas (n = 2), liposarcomas (n = 2), and angiomyosarcoma (n = 1)). Surgical approaches were perineal in 8 patients, abdominoperineal in 1 patient, and totally abdominal in 1 patient. One patient (age 90 years) was managed nonsurgically. After resection, 2 positive margins were observed (R1 rate, 20%). After a mean follow-up of 24.3 months, 3 patients have experienced local recurrence, which required further surgery in 2 cases. LIMITATIONS: This study is limited by the small number of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Noninflammatory masses in the ischiorectal fossa are rare, but they are commonly malignant and should be imaged by MRI. Unless the radiological appearances are diagnostic, percutaneous biopsy is recommended and alters management in about one-third of cases."

"The co-existence of a chondrosarcoma of the chest wall and a desmoid tumor in the gastrointestinal tract is rare. In both Polish and global literature, cases of chest wall chondrosarcomas are presented in the form of case reports. Desmoids of the gastrointestinal tract are more common; notwithstanding, their incidence in Europe is estimated at approximately 2 cases per 1 million inhabitants per year. We present the case of a 62-year-old female patient who suffered from both a chest wall chondrosarcoma and a desmoid tumor of the intestine; both neoplasms were operated on simultaneously. The former tumor was located in the region of the right costal margin, whereas the latter was located in the mesojejunum. The surgery was performed with two independent surgical incisions. The postoperative period was uneventful. The case is noteworthy in view of the extremely rare synchronous occurrence of the described tumors and due to the fact that any such operation requires an individualized surgical approach."
"3 patients (2.7%) reported permanent numbness in the peroneal division distribution, and 2 patients (1.8%) were diagnosed with neuromuscular choristoma that developed desmoid tumor at the biopsy site 3 and 8 years later. CONCLUSIONS Targeted fascicular biopsy of the sciatic nerve is a safe and efficient diagnostic procedure, and in highly selected cases can be offered as the initial procedure over distal cutaneous nerve biopsy. Diagnoses were very diverse and included entities considered very rare. Even for the more prevalent diagnoses, the biopsy technique allowed a more targeted approach with a higher diagnostic yield and justification for more aggressive treatment. In this series, new radiological patterns of some entities were identified, which could be biopsied less frequently."
"A 20-year-old woman with Gardner syndrome and intra-abdominal desmoid tumors presented with increasing abdominal pain. CT demonstrated a new area of central hypodensity in a presumed desmoid tumor, compressing the left ureter. Findings were suspicious for abscess or fistula to the ureter. Subsequent 99mTc-MAG3 renogram demonstrated persistent extraureteral radiotracer activity in the region of the tumor, confirming a desmoid tumor-ureteral fistula. Desmoid tumors are benign but locally aggressive fibrous neoplasms that can be sporadic or associated with familial adenomatous polyposis syndromes, specifically Gardner syndrome. Fistula formation to the ureter has been reported infrequently."
"Aim of this study is to evaluate the outcome of long-term conservative treatment with sulindac and high-dose selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) for sporadic and FAP-associated desmoid tumors. Desmoids are very rare tumors in the general population but occur frequently in FAP patients, being encountered in 23-38 %. Treatment of desmoids is still most controversial since response cannot be predicted and they are prone to develop recurrence. This study included all desmoid patients that were treated and followed at our institution and had completed at least 1 year of treatment. Response was defined as stable size or regression of desmoid size between two CT or MRI scans. A total of 134 patients were included. 64 (47.8 %) patients had a confirmed diagnosis of FAP, 69 (51.5 %) patients were sporadic. Overall 114 (85.1 %) patients showed regressive or stable desmoid size. Patients with previous history of multiple desmoid-related surgeries showed less-favorable response. The mean time to reach at least stable size was 14.9 (+/-9.1) months. After regression or stabilization, medication was tapered in 69 (60.5 %) of the treated patients with only one long-term recurrence after >10 years. The results of this study fortify the role of sulindac and high-dose SERMs as an effective and safe treatment for both, sporadic and FAP-associated desmoid tumors. While invasive treatment frequently results in high recurrence rates, high morbidity and high mortality, this conservative treatment is successful in most patients. The recurrence rate is negligible with no desmoid-related mortality in this large series. Therefore surgical resection, especially for mesenteric desmoids, should be deferred favoring this convincingly effective, well tolerated regimen."
"Desmoplastic fibroma is a rare benign fibrogenic, locally aggressive, primary bone tumor. It is the intraosseous counterpart of soft tissue aggressive fibromatosis. The lesion may very rarely appear as a superficial bone lesion arising from the periosteum; in such cases, a soft tissue mass with changes in the adjacent bone is evident. Periosteal lesions are very rare in the literature; diagnosis is usually based on the radiographic findings, and histological proof of the tumor origin is missing. A periosteal desmoplastic fibroma of the distal tibial metaphysis in a 3-year-old boy is presented. Radiographic investigation included plain radiographs and computed tomography imaging. Both demonstrated a soft tissue lesion involving the superficial bone tissues with non-aggressive looking borders and a pressure effect with a sclerotic rim in the bone. The lesion was excised, and the surgical as well as the histological findings indicated the diagnosis of a desmoplastic fibroma of bone arising from the periosteum. No recurrence was detected 5 years after surgery."

"The optimal management of prenatally diagnosed asymptomatic congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAM) is controversial. Since there is a paucity of data relating to surgical risks in this specific population, we reviewed our experience to further inform this controversy. METHODS: Ethically approved 10 year (2004-2013) retrospective review. Patients were included only if the CPAM was diagnosed prenatally and remained asymptomatic. Indication for surgery was physician recommendation and/or parental choice. MAIN RESULTS: Sixty patients were identified. Median age at surgery was 6.5 months (range 65 days to 9.6 years). Resections were performed thoracoscopically (n = 51, one conversion) or by thoracotomy (n = 9). Surgical time was 2.5 hr (43 min to 4.75 hr). A chest drain was used in 58/60 and remained in situ 53 hr (23-108). There were no intra-operative complications or blood transfusions. All patients were extubated at the end of the procedure with no re-intubations. Post-operative hospitalization was 73.4 hr (23.8 hr to 4.2 days). Overall, complications occurred in 14/60 (23%). Eleven were minor but three were major: tension pneumothorax associated with new presentation of a small previously undiagnosed diaphragmatic hernia 5 days following resection; aggressive fibromatosis of the chest wall in the region close to resection 2 years later; and near-fatal hypovolemic cardiac arrest due to massive haemorrhage from a feeding vessel on postoperative day 7. There were no deaths and no cases of pleuropulmonary blastoma. CONCLUSION: Resection of prenatally diagnosed asymptomatic CPAM is associated with a significant risk of complications, which may be life threatening. These data contribute to a balanced discussion of risks and benefits for these children."
"Desmoid tumors, also known as desmoid-type fibromatoses or aggressive fibromatoses, are clonal fibroblastic proliferations that arise in the deep soft tissues. They are characterized by infiltrative growth, a tendency toward local recurrence and the inability to metastasize. We present a case of a 63-year-old woman who complained of abdominal pain, and a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan revealed a well-circumscribed tumor in the pancreatic tail, measuring 5.1 cm. A left-sided, spleen-preserving pancreatic resection was performed, and pathological analysis showed a mesenchymal tumor. The diagnosis of a pancreatic desmoid tumor was made based on the characteristic morphology and the immune phenotype of the tumor. The English-language literature on pancreatic desmoid tumors was reviewed. In total, 16 previous cases were identified."
"Fibromatosis refers to an extra-abdominal desmoid tumor or aggressive fibromatosis. Breast fibromatosis can develop in association with the capsule around a breast implant, although reports of cases of fibromatosis associated with breast implants are rare. As the demand for breast augmentation has increased, it is important to understand the diseases associated with breast implants. In the present report, we describe a case of breast fibromatosis that developed adjacent to a breast implant and demonstrated a relatively well-defined border even though it invaded the surrounding structures. We also explore the specific imaging features for diagnosing breast fibromatosis in association with implants by reviewing previous literature."
"Background Desmoid tumors are benign soft tissue tumors that locally invade adjacent tissue. There is a paucity of reports describing the rapid growth of these tumors during pregnancy. Case A giant desmoid tumor arising from the left abdominal wall of a young female patient with rapid growth during pregnancy is described. Preoperative evaluation included ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging. Decision made by a multidisciplinary team was not to intervene before birth, and abdominal delivery at term was accomplished. Conclusion Desmoid tumors should be part of the differential diagnosis in an abdominal wall tumor of rapid growth during pregnancy. Future studies are needed for better understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of desmoid tumors in pregnant women."
"Fibromatosis also known as desmoid tumor is an uncommon cause of a mediastinal mass in patients of all ages. Imaging appearance of fibromatosis is generally nonspecific and demands special attention to subtle details to be correctly identified as a possibility. Management of the patient is often complicated by failure to obtain precise pre-operative diagnosis. Location of a mass in the anterior mediastinum with encasement of vital structures is not favourable for complete cure. Although histologically benign, biological behaviour of the lesion varies between benign fibrous proliferation and low-grade fibrosarcoma. We present imaging appearances, surgical management dilemma, and the histopathological details of a case of fibromatosis in the anterior mediastinum in a child."
"Desmoid tumors are a group of benign, invasive, solid tumors that are relatively rare in the general population, but can occur in up to 21 % of patients with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP). They can be difficult to treat and have high rates of recurrence even after resection. Our goal with this study was to identify the genetic mutations that put certain patients with FAP at high risk for desmoid tumors and could be future targets for research. METHODS: We performed a search in Pubmed, Ovid Medline and Embase to identify subjects with desmoid tumors and FAP. As a reference group for APC mutations in the unselected FAP population, we used the UMD-APC database referenced in the Orphanet portal which includes APC mutation data on 2040 individuals with FAP. RESULTS: Mutations were able to be broken down into 7 regions based on previously published data. Mutations in the APC gene from codons 1310 to 2011 were the most common region encompassing 48 % of published desmoid cases and 40 % of the reference population. It had a slightly elevated odds ratio of 1.4 that was statistically significant along with codon region 543-713 that had an odds ratio of 2.0. Using a combination of p-value and CI, the remaining 5 regions did not meet statistical significance as either the p >0.05 or the CI included 1.0. The most common point mutation found was codon 1309 (13.1 %), but it was also the most commonly found mutation in our reference population (12.9 %) and had an odds ratio of 1.0. CONCLUSIONS: There is an increased risk for desmoid tumors in individuals with APC mutations between codons 543-713 and 1310-2011 when compared to a reference population. These patients may benefit from further study to develop surveillance protocols that could improve outcomes."
"Desmoid tumors are rare soft tissue tumors considered to have locally infiltrative features without distant metastasis until now. Although they are most commonly intraabdominal, very few cases have extra-abdominal locations. The origin of intrathoracic desmoid tumors is predominantly the chest wall with occasional involvement of pleura. True intrathoracic primary desmoid tumors with no involvement of the chest wall or pleura are extremely rare. We recently experienced a case of true intrathoracic desmoid tumor presenting as multiple lung nodules at 13 years after resection of a previous intraabdominal desmoid tumor."
"CTNNB1 mutations or APC abnormalities have been observed in approximately 85% of desmoids examined by Sanger sequencing and are associated with Wnt/beta-catenin activation. We sought to identify molecular aberrations in ""wild-type"" tumors (those without CTNNB1 or APC alteration) and to determine their prognostic relevance. CTNNB1 was examined by Sanger sequencing in 117 desmoids; a mutation was observed in 101 (86%) and 16 were wild type. Wild-type status did not associate with tumor recurrence. Moreover, in unsupervised clustering based on U133A-derived gene expression profiles, wild-type and mutated tumors clustered together. Whole-exome sequencing of eight of the wild-type desmoids revealed that three had a CTNNB1 mutation that had been undetected by Sanger sequencing. The mutation was found in a mean 16% of reads (vs. 37% for mutations identified by Sanger). Of the other five wild-type tumors sequenced, two had APC loss, two had chromosome 6 loss, and one had mutation of BMI1. The finding of low-frequency CTNNB1 mutation or APC loss in wild-type desmoids was validated in the remaining eight wild-type desmoids; directed miSeq identified low-frequency CTNNB1 mutation in four and comparative genomic hybridization identified APC loss in one. These results demonstrate that mutations affecting CTNNB1 or APC occur more frequently in desmoids than previously recognized (111 of 117; 95%), and designation of wild-type genotype is largely determined by sensitivity of detection methods. Even true CTNNB1 wild-type tumors (determined by next-generation sequencing) may have genomic alterations associated with Wnt activation (chromosome 6 loss/BMI1 mutation), supporting Wnt/beta-catenin activation as the common pathway governing desmoid initiation."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) is a benign non-encapsulated tumor of mesenchymal origin, with a tendency for local spread along fascial planes. Local invasion can lead to extensive morbidity and even mortality due to destruction of the bones, organs and soft tissues. This rare lesion is observed 1,000 times more frequently in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis or Gardner's syndrome due to the inheritance of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. While AF does not metastasize, local recurrence is common. Distant recurrence is extremely rare, but is observed in those with a germ line APC mutation. The present study details the case of a 20-year-old woman with a melanoma of the right shoulder, treated definitively with surgery. The patient then developed a painful mass at the surgical site; a surgical biopsy demonstrated that the mass was AF. The patient was treated with surgical resection, radiation therapy, and a course of tamoxifen. Five years later, the patient presented with left forearm pain and diminished range of motion due to an infiltrating mass. This was excised and a clinical diagnosis of recurrent AF was made, in this patient lacking familial predisposition to the disease."

"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a rare, locally infiltrative, mesenchymal neoplasm that is associated with high rates of local recurrence but lacks the potential to metastasise. The disease affects younger individuals, with a peak age of 30 years, and is the most common cause of an anterior abdominal wall mass in young women of childbearing age. It may, however, involve nearly every body part, including the extremities, head and neck, trunk, and abdominal cavity; as such, desmoid-type fibromatosis may present to a range of general and subspecialty radiologists. These rare tumours have a widely variable clinical presentation and unpredictable natural history, hence input from a soft-tissue tumour centre is recommended, although much of the imaging may be performed at the patient's local hospital. The consensus for treatment has changed over the past decade, with most centres moving away from primary radical surgery towards a front-line 'watch-and-wait' policy. Therefore, imaging has an increasingly important role to play in both the diagnosis and follow-up of these patients. This review will discuss the typical imaging characteristics of these lesions and suggest diagnostic and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging protocols, with details of suitable sequences and scanning intervals."
"The partial substitution of the ureter using a pediculated double short segments of the ileum is a technique used to re-establish ureteral transit and preserve the renal unit, following the resection of extensive ureteral lesions. Standard surgical procedure for an ileoureteroplasty consists of isolating an ileal duct of equal or greater length than the ureteral defect and interposing it in the urinary tract in an isoperistaltic direction. Monti described a surgical technique that allows for the creation of catheterizable stomas in continent urinary diversions, using the Mitrofanoff principle. These passageways were created from one or several 2.5 cm long ileal sections by means of their detubulization and transverse retubulization."

"The patient had found local uplift on the left nasal vestibule area for 3 years. An 2.0 cm x 1.0 cm mass was found on the left nasal vestibule area, which had tough texture, clear boundaries and no tenderness. In the operation, the tumor was found located between the left maxilla and major alar cartilage with no capsule and unclear boundary. The tumor is aggressive fibromatosis, which has invasive growth in adjacent muscle tissue. Immunohistochemical results: Ki-67, Vimentin(+), SMA(+), CD31(+), CD34(+), CK(-), Desmin (-), S-100(-), LCA(-). DIAGNOSIS: Aggressive fibromatosis."
"To investigate thermal dose volume (TDV) and non-perfused volume (NPV) of magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) treatments in patients with soft tissue tumors, and describe a method for MR thermal dosimetry using a baseline reference. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Agreement between TDV and immediate post treatment NPV was evaluated from MRgFUS treatments of five patients with biopsy-proven desmoid tumors. Thermometry data (gradient echo, 3T) were analyzed over the entire course of the treatments to discern temperature errors in the standard approach. The technique searches previously acquired baseline images for a match using 2D normalized cross-correlation and a weighted mean of phase difference images. Thermal dose maps and TDVs were recalculated using the matched baseline and compared to NPV. RESULTS: TDV and NPV showed between 47%-91% disagreement, using the standard immediate baseline method for calculating TDV. Long-term thermometry showed a nonlinear local temperature accrual, where peak additional temperature varied between 4-13 degrees C (mean = 7.8 degrees C) across patients. The prior baseline method could be implemented by finding a previously acquired matching baseline 61% +/- 8% (mean +/- SD) of the time. We found 7%-42% of the disagreement between TDV and NPV was due to errors in thermometry caused by heat accrual. For all patients, the prior baseline method increased the estimated treatment volume and reduced the discrepancies between TDV and NPV (P = 0.023). CONCLUSION: This study presents a mismatch between in-treatment and post treatment efficacy measures. The prior baseline approach accounts for local heating and improves the accuracy of thermal dose-predicted volume."

"Truncating mutations in the tumor suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) are the initiating step in the vast majority of sporadic colorectal cancers, and they underlie familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) syndromes. Modeling of APC- driven tumor formation in the mouse has contributed substantially to our mechanistic understanding of the associated disease, but additional models are needed to explore therapeutic opportunities and overcome current limitations of mouse models. We report on a novel and penetrant genetic cancer model in Xenopus tropicalis, an aquatic tetrapod vertebrate with external development, diploid genome and short life cycle. Tadpoles and froglets derived from embryos injected with TAL effector nucleases targeting the apc gene rapidly developed intestinal hyperplasia and other neoplasms observed in FAP patients, including desmoid tumors and medulloblastomas. Bi-allelic apc mutations causing frame shifts were detected in the tumors, which displayed activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway and showed increased cellular proliferation. We further demonstrate that simultaneous double bi-allelic mutation of apc and a non-relevant gene is possible in the neoplasias, opening the door for identification and characterization of effector or modifier genes in tumors expressing truncated apc. Our results demonstrate the power of modeling human cancer in Xenopus tropicalis using mosaic TALEN-mediated bi-allelic gene disruption."
"This study was aimed to illustrate the pre- and post-treatment imaging findings of musculoskeletal desmoid tumours and describe current treatment methods. Imaging of histologically proven cases of desmoid tumours at St. Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, were obtained via picture archiving communication system (PACS) and then assessed by two musculoskeletal radiologists. Suitable imaging both pre- and post-treatment were then obtained from PACS. All imaging chosen were de-identified. Ninety-two patients were found to have histologically proven cases of desmoid tumours between January 2000 and December 2013. Six patients with extra-abdominal tumours were selected, where pre- and post-treatment imaging was available. Desmoid tumours can occur in many areas of the body. Treatment of desmoids are varied. Although wide-margin surgery has been the traditional form of treatment, it still cannot guarantee absence of tumour recurrence despite microscopically tumour-free margins. Other forms of treatment such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and also the conservative 'watch and wait' approach have been suggested, which show varying results."
"Adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) is a tumor suppressor that inhibits Wnt/Ctnnb1. Mutations of Apc will not only lead to familial adenomatous polyposis with associated epithelial lesions, but will also cause aggressive fibromatosis in mesenchymal cells. However, the roles of Apc in regulating mesenchymal cell biology and organogenesis during development are unknown. RESULTS: We have specifically deleted the Apc gene in lung mesenchymal cells during early lung development in mice. Loss of Apc function resulted in immediate mesenchymal cell hyperproliferation through abnormal activation of Wnt/Ctnnb1, followed by a subsequent inhibition of cell proliferation due to cell cycle arrest at G0/G1, which was caused by a mechanism independent of Wnt/Ctnnb1. Meanwhile, abrogation of Apc also disrupted lung mesenchymal cell differentiation, including decreased airway and vascular smooth muscle cells, the presence of Sox9-positive mesenchymal cells in the peripheral lung, and excessive versican production. Moreover, lung epithelial branching morphogenesis was drastically inhibited due to disrupted Bmp4-Fgf10 morphogen production and regulation in surrounding lung mesenchyme. Lastly, lung mesenchyme-specific Apc conditional knockout also resulted in altered lung vasculogenesis and disrupted pulmonary vascular continuity through a paracrine mechanism, leading to massive pulmonary hemorrhage and lethality at mid-gestation when the pulmonary circulation should have started. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that Apc in lung mesenchyme plays central roles in coordinating the proper development of several quite different cellular compartments including lung epithelial branching and pulmonary vascular circulation during lung organogenesis."

"The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is involved in a variety of biological processes like cell proliferation, cell polarity, and cell fate determination. This pathway has been extensively investigated as its deregulation is linked to different diseases, including various types of cancer, skeletal defects, birth defect disorders (including neural tube defects), metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative disorders and several fibrotic diseases like desmoid tumors. In the ""on state"", beta-catenin, the key effector of Wnt signaling, enters the nucleus where it binds to the members of the TCF-LEF family of transcription factors and exerts its effect on gene transcription. Disease development can be caused by direct or indirect alterations of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. In the first case germline or somatic mutations of the Wnt components are associated to several diseases such as the familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) - caused by germline mutations of the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC) - and the desmoid-like fibromatosis, a sporadic tumor associated with somatic mutations of the beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1). In the second case, epigenetic modifications and microenvironmental factors have been demonstrated to play a key role in Wnt pathway activation. The natural autocrine Wnt signaling acts through agonists and antagonists competing for the Wnt receptors. Anomalies in this regulation, whichever is their etiology, are an important part in the pathogenesis of Wnt pathway linked diseases. An example is promoter hypermethylation of Wnt antagonists, such as SFRPs, that causes gene silencing preventing their function and consequently leading to the activation of the Wnt pathway. Microenvironmental factors, such as the extracellular matrix, growth factors and inflammatory mediators, represent another type of indirect mechanism that influence Wnt pathway activation. A favorable microenvironment can lead to aberrant fibroblasts activation and accumulation of ECM proteins with subsequent tissue fibrosis that can evolve in fibrotic disease or tumor. Since the development and progression of several diseases is the outcome of the Wnt pathway cross-talk with other signaling pathways and inflammatory factors, it is important to consider not only direct inhibitors of the Wnt signaling pathway but also inhibitors of microenvironmental factors as promising therapeutic approaches for several tumors of fibrotic origin."
"Desmoid tumors are fibromatous lesions that are the result of abnormal proliferation of myofibroblasts. Despite its benign microscopic appearance and non-metastasizing behavior, tumor infiltrates surrounding tissues and has a high risk of recurrence. Pregnancy-associated desmoid tumors are very rare and optimal management of this tumor is not well established. The authors report a case of a 31-year-old pregnant woman with a large desmoid tumor, which increased rapidly in size and caused worsening symptom of dyspnea. The tumor was successfully removed during a caesarian section, which resulted in an anterior abdominal wall defect. Reconstruction of the abdominal wall defect was performed with a polypropylene mesh. The postoperative recovery of the patient was uneventful. After a follow-up of 44 months, the patient was found to be well and there was no evidence of local recurrence. The authors also reviewed the literature on the world's experience with this tumor and its management during pregnancy.Twelve desmoid tumors arising during pregnancy were reported in the existing literature; the managements were varied and has yet to be defined."
"Fibrous and myofibroblastic tumors of soft tissue often present the surgical pathologist with a difficult differential diagnosis because of the number of diagnostic possibilities and morphologic similarities among cytologically bland spindle-cell tumors. Prototypical in this regard is desmoid-type fibromatosis. In a review of 320 surgical specimens diagnosed as desmoid tumor, 94 (29%) were discovered to be misclassified as such. The most common lesions in this series were Gardner fibroma, scar tissue, superficial fibromatosis, nodular fasciitis, myofibroma, and collagenous fibroma. Four sarcomas were also misinterpreted as desmoid-type fibromatosis (3 low-grade fibromyxoid sarcomas and 1 unclassified spindle-cell sarcoma). We take this opportunity to compare and contrast desmoid tumor and several of the soft tissue tumors that should be considered in the differential diagnosis thereof."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) is a locally infiltrating soft-tissue tumor. In a population-based study in the Netherlands, we evaluated time trends for the incidence and treatment of AF. METHODS: In PALGA: Dutch Pathology Registry, all patients diagnosed between 1993 and 2013 as having extra-abdominal or abdominal wall aggressive fibromatosis were identified and available pathology data of the patients were evaluated. Epidemiological and treatment-related factors were analyzed with chi (2)and regression analysis. RESULTS: During the study period, 1134 patients were identified. The incidence increased from 2.10 to 5.36 per million people per year. Median age at the time of diagnosis increased annually by B 0.285 (P = 0.001). Female gender prevailed and increased over time [annual odds ratio (OR) 1.022; P = 0.058]. All anatomic localizations, but in particular truncal tumors, became more frequent. During the study period diagnostic histological biopsies were performed more often (annual OR 1.096; P < 0.001). The proportion of patients who underwent surgical treatment decreased (annual OR 0.928; P < 0.001). When resection was preceded by biopsy, 49.8 % of the patients had R0-resection versus 30.7 % in patients without biopsy (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based study, an increasing incidence of extra-abdominal and abdominal-wall aggressive fibromatosis was observed. The workup of patients improved and a trend towards a nonsurgical treatment policy was observed."
"MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound is a noninvasive treatment modality that uses focused ultrasound waves to thermally ablate tumors within the human body while minimizing side effects to surrounding healthy tissues. This technology is FDA-approved for certain tumors and has potential to be a noninvasive treatment option for extremity soft tissue tumors. Development of treatment modalities that achieve tumor control, decrease morbidity, or both might be of great benefit for patients. We wanted to assess the potential use of this technology in the treatment of extremity desmoid tumors. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Can we use MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound to accurately ablate a predetermined target volume within a human cadaver extremity? (2) Does MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment stop progression and/or cause regression of extremity desmoid tumors? METHODS: Simulated tumor volumes in four human cadavers, created by using plastic markers, were ablated using a commercially available focused ultrasound system. Accuracy was determined in accordance with the International Organization of Standards location error by measuring the farthest distance between the ablated tissue and the plane corresponding to the target. Between 2012 and 2014, we treated nine patients with desmoid tumors using focused ultrasound ablation. Indications for this were tumor-related symptoms or failure of conventional treatment. Of those, five of them were available for MRI followup at 12 months or longer (mean, 18.2 months; range, 12-23 months). The radiographic and clinical outcomes of five patients who had desmoid tumors treated with focused ultrasound were prospectively recorded. Patients were assessed preoperatively with MRI and followed at routine intervals after treatment with MRI scans and clinical examination. RESULTS: The ablation accuracy for the four cadaver extremities was 5 mm, 3 mm, 8 mm, and 8 mm. Four patients' tumors became smaller after treatment and one patient has slight progression at the time of last followup. The mean decrease in tumor size determined by MRI measurements was 36% (95% confidence interval, 7%-66%). No patient has received additional adjuvant systemic or local treatment. Treatment-related adverse events included first- and second-degree skin burns occurring in four patients, which were managed successfully without further surgery. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary investigation provides some evidence that MR-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound may be a feasible treatment for desmoid tumors. It may also be of use for other soft tissue neoplasms in situations in which there are limited traditional treatment options such as recurrent sarcomas. Further investigation is necessary to better define the indications, efficacy, role, and long-term oncologic outcomes of focused ultrasound treatment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study."
"Extended and full-thickness abdominal wall defects are commonly reconstructed using free flaps. Published surgical outcomes involving the latissimus dorsi (LD) free flap procedure are limited and are less numerous than those with free flaps involving the thigh. The aim of this report was to describe the immediate and long-term evaluation of complex abdominal wall reconstruction using a LD free flap with mesh. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2005 and 2013, nine patients with extended malignant tumors of the abdominal wall underwent surgeries. After the surgical resection, the mean defect size was 385 cm(2) (range: 190-650 cm(2) ). Full-thickness abdominal wall reconstruction was performed with a combination of LD free flaps and meshes. The immediate and long-term outcomes were assessed regarding the complications, sustainable strength of the abdominal wall and cancer recurrence. RESULTS: The meshes measured 927 cm(2) in average (range: 500-1036 cm(2) ). Eight Parietex Composite(R) and 1 Bard Collamend Implant(R) were used. No donor site complications occurred, and complete LD flap survival was achieved without partial necrosis or thrombosis. One obese patient who received a porcine dermis mesh developed an eventration four days postoperatively and exhibited a limited amount of abdominal skin necrosis around the flap. Two patients died from cancer evolution. After a mean follow-up of 60.4 months (range: 29-94 months), clinical evaluation of the abdomen revealed 2 patients without anomalies, 4 cases of abdominal bulging without functional discomfort and 1 case of major abdominal distension. CONCLUSIONS: Complex abdominal reconstruction with LD free flap and mesh allows extended satisfactory coverage with a low incidence of flap and donor site complications. However, patients should be advised of the significant risk of abdominal bulging. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Microsurgery 37:38-43, 2017."
"Retrorectal tumors, are a rare and interesting entity, traditionally managed with surgery. The surgical approach is a key to get an easy and safe access. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of resection by a transsacrococcygeal approach. Thirty-six patients had retrorectal tumors resected by a transsacrococcygeal approach in our department. All the tumors were en bloc resected, irrespective of size and anatomical depth. The clinic data were retrospectively reviewed. Tumor mean size was 10 +/- 4.4 cm. In 16 cases, tumors were 10 cm or more in size. The largest tumor measured 20 cm. The estimated mean blood loss was 130 ml. No mortality and severe postoperative complications were observed. The most significant issues were wound infection and delayed healing. Pathology showed 15 cases of epidermal cysts, two cases of enterogenous cyst, one case of bronchogenic cyst, 12 cases of teratoma, two cases of schwannoma, two cases of low-grade malignant fibrous myxoma, one case of aggressive angiomyxoma, one case of desmoid tumor. The transsacrococcygeal approach gives an easy access and good visualization with fewer complications. This surgical approach shows to be safe and effective for resection of retrorectal tumors."
"We retrospectively evaluated the results of surgical treatment for anterior abdominal wall -desmoid tumours. METHODS: Records for 13 patients operated on for desmoid tumours from 1997-2013 were searched for age, gender, abdominal/pelvic surgical history, pregnancy, Gardner's syndrome, pre-operative radiological examinations, tumour size, multifocality, surgical procedure, tumour presence at surgical margins, recurrence, morbidity, and mortality. Local recurrence-free survival probabilities were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and stratified by various clinicopathological variables. RESULTS: There were 11 female (84,6%) and 2 male (15,4%) patients with a median age of 36 years. Seven (53,8%) -patients had previous abdominal/pelvic surgery, five (38,5%) had a history of pregnancy, and one (7,6%) had Gardner's Syndrome. Two (15,3%) patients had multifocality on their pre-operative radiological examinations. Mean tumour -diameter was 4,6 cm (SD 3,2 cm ; range 2-12 cm). After the excision of the masses in five (38,5%) patients, synthetic materials were used to close the abdominal wall defects. Two (15,3%) patients with positive surgical margins after -surgery were re-operated. Three (23%) patients required a second surgical intervention after the mass excisions were performed. Mean follow-up time was 56,7 months. Recurrence was observed in three patients during follow-up. Increased tumour size, history of previous abdominal/pelvic surgery, and the presence of multifocality had a negative effect on local recurrence-free survival. There was no mortality during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Desmoid tumours are characterized by high recurrence, even after proper surgical excisions. Preoperative differential diagnoses of these tumours should be done and a post-operative follow-up protocol should be followed."
"Despite the benign histologic appearance and negligible metastatic potential, desmoid tumors can be locally aggressive, invading into adjacent structures and organs. We report an unusual case of desmoid-type fibromatosis causing the death of an otherwise healthy individual by rupturing the splenic artery."
"Desmoid-type fibromatoses (DFs) are rare soft-tissue neoplasms with frequent local recurrence. We sought to determine the prognostic factors that are predictive of recurrence-free survival (RFS) for these tumors. METHODS: One hundred and fourteen consecutive patients with sporadic DF who received macroscopically complete resection (R0/R1) at a single tertiary hospital between 1985 and 2014 were included. A total of 10 clinical and pathological parameters were analyzed. Histologic slides and the margin status were re-checked; close margins (</=1-mm clearance) were noted separately and were considered together with the R1 margin. RESULTS: The median follow-up interval was 72.5 months. Thirty-five (30.7%) patients had a local recurrence. The 2-, 5- and 10-year RFSs were 75.2%, 72.1% and 67.0%, respectively. In univariate analysis, age, tumor size, tumor site, margin status and presence of lesions at multiple sites had a significant impact on RFS. In multiple analysis, younger age (age<30 vs. age>/=50 years: hazard ratio [HR] = 4.96; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.50-16.4; p = 0.009); an extra-abdominal site (extra-abdominal site vs. other sites: HR = 4.08; 95% CI, 1.49-11.2; p = 0.006); larger tumor size (>/=8 cm vs. <8 cm: HR = 2.43; 95% CI, 1.15-5.13; p = 0.021); and close or positive margin status (close margin/R1 vs. R0: HR = 2.64; 95% CI, 1.11-6.25; p = 0.027) were independent, unfavorable prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Different prognostic subgroups were identified that allow for the better selection of favorable therapeutic strategies. The role of the margin status should be considered with caution and should be based on a more precise pathological result."
This study aimed to discuss the role medical imaging has on diagnosis of musculoskeletal desmoid tumours and to describe their radiological appearances on various imaging modalities. Imaging of histologically proven cases of desmoid tumours at St. Vincent's Hospital Melbourne were obtained via picture archiving communication system (PACS) and then assessed by two musculoskeletal radiologists. Suitable imagings were obtained from PACS. All imaging chosen was de-identified. Desmoid tumours can occur in many areas of the body. Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis of these tumours and magnetic resonance imaging has been the gold standard for imaging and is the most accurate in terms of assessing tumour margins and involvement of surrounding structures.
"We report a case involving an intrathoracic desmoid tumor in a 68-year-old woman who had undergone video-assisted thoracoscopic right basal segmentectomy for lung cancer 1 year earlier. The well demarcated tumor was 9 cm x 6 cm x 6 cm in size, was located in the right apico-posterior thorax and had invaded the chest wall. The patient complained of a dull shoulder pain as a result of rapid tumor enlargement. En bloc tumor resection, including the apico-posterior chest wall extending from the 1st to the 4th rib, was successful. The patient had no recurrent tumor at 5 years after the second surgery. Intrathoracic desmoid tumor could occur, even when the tumor arises at a distance from the port and thoracotomy sites after thoracoscopic surgery."
"Melorheostosis is an uncommon, sporadic, sclerosing bone lesion that may affect the adjacent soft tissues. It has been associated with many entities such as osteopoikilosis, soft tissue vascular malformations, bone and soft tissue tumors, nephrotic syndrome, segmental limb contractures, osteosarcoma, desmoid tumor, and mesenteric fibromatosis. Synovial osteochondromatosis is a benign neoplasia of the hyaline cartilage presenting as nodules in the subsynovial tissue of a joint or tendon sheath. The intra-articular extension of melorheostosis mimicking synovial osteochondromatosis has not been reported before. In this article, the authors describe an unusual case mimicking synovial chondromatosis arising as a result of melorheostosis and their characteristic imaging findings."

"Desmoid tumor is a rare, benign, usually asymptomatic fibromatous lesion. The etiology is unknown and the diagnosis is based on histopathological examination. The treatment is complete resection of the tumor. Pancreatic desmoid tumor is extremely rare. In the literature there have been only 11 cases described, most of them as solid or solid-cystic masses. We report the case of a patient with an isolated cystic pancreatic desmoid tumor that is, to the best of our knowledge, the second reported case. CASE PRESENTATION: A 13-year old Caucasian boy presented with recurrent pain of two months' duration in the left hypochondrium of his abdomen. An ultrasound examination and computed tomography scan revealed the presence of a cystic mass located in his splenic hilum, tightly adjacent to the pancreatic tail. A splenic cyst was suspected. Operative findings showed a 10 x 10 cm cystic mass tightly connected to the pancreatic tail and left colonic flexure, adherent to the spleen, splenic vein and artery. Distal splenopancreatectomy with en bloc resection of the left colonic flexure was performed. Histological analysis confirmed that the resection was complete. The mass had infiltrated the pancreatic parenchyma. All tumor cells were positive for anti-beta-catenin staining characteristic for desmoid tumor. No abnormalities in the spleen and colon were found. CONCLUSIONS: Isolated sporadic pancreatic desmoid tumor with cyst formation is extremely rare and its diagnosis can be difficult, especially because of uncharacteristic symptoms and radiological findings, as in our patient. This case report should be of interest not only to surgeons, as the treatment of choice is radical resection, but also gastroenterologists, considering it is in close relation with familial adenomatous polyposis, and oncologists as the reason for differentiation with other pancreatic tumors."
"The optimal management of recurrent desmoid-type fibromatosis is undefined. This study was performed to determine what factors, if any, predict second recurrence after surgical resection of recurrent desmoid tumors. Of 41 patients with recurrent desmoid-type fibromatosis, 29 underwent surgical resection and 8 were followed by observation. Four others received adjuvant chemo/pharmacotherapy. Clinicopathologic features were assessed as prognostic factors for second recurrence after surgical resection of recurrent desmoid tumors by Cox proportional hazards regression. Nine of 29 patients who underwent surgical resection of recurrent desmoid tumor developed a second recurrence. Larger size of recurrent tumor was associated with increased risk of second recurrence (hazard ratio, 1.09; P = 0.006). Treatment of the primary tumor with adjuvant radiation therapy also increased risk of re-recurrence (3.41; P = 0.032). Second recurrence of desmoid-type fibromatosis after surgical resection is, much like recurrence of primary desmoid tumor, difficult to predict with current prognostic indicators."
"This study was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of low-dose chemotherapy with methotrexate (MTX) and vinblastine (VBL) for patients with desmoid tumors refractory to meloxicam treatment, focusing in particular on the relationship between the efficacy of this chemotherapy and catenin beta-1 (CTNNB1) mutation status. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since March 2003, patients pathologically diagnosed with extraperitoneal desmoid tumors have been prospectively treated with meloxicam, a COX-2 inhibitor, at our institution. Patients with inoperable tumors who were resistant to meloxicam treatment underwent MTX and VBL therapy every other week. The responses of all patients were evaluated, and factors that were correlated with efficacy were analyzed, including CTNNB1 mutation status. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were prospectively treated with meloxicam. MTX + VBL therapy was administered in 15 patients. Six patients showed a partial response. Only one patient presented disease progression. A few patients showed grade 3-4 treatment-related toxicity with the administration of MTX and VBL every other week. Intriguingly, CTNNB1 status did not affect the efficacy of this treatment. CONCLUSION: MTX and VBL treatment every other week is well tolerated and achieved a favorable response in patients resistant to meloxicam treatment, regardless of CTNNB1 mutation status."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is a rare disease characterized by a monoclonal, fibroblastic proliferation and a variable and often unpredictable clinical course. Although histologically benign, DF is locally invasive and associated with a high local recurrence rate, but lacks any metastatic potential. As there is no established or evidence-based treatment approach available as of today, an individualized treatment strategy is fundamental in the light of highly variable clinical presentations, anatomic locations, and biological behaviors. Surgery with negative margins has been the cornerstone of DF treatment; however, an overall reassessment of the management of DF patients has taken place in the last few years, and preservation of function and quality of life has become a priority in these patients. Evidence is scarce for systemic treatment; different pharmacological options can be proposed and will be reviewed here. To better define possible therapeutic strategies, a consensus approach has been initiated, bringing together sarcoma experts from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma Group (STBSG) with patient advocates from Sarcoma Patients EuroNet (SPAEN). As a prerequisite, patients should be discussed in a multidisciplinary setting in centers/networks with specific expertise and experience in this disease."
"The clinical features and the pathological changes of desmoid tumors were studied to point out the key factors affecting the recurrence. METHODS: The clinical data and specimens of 56 patients who underwent desmoid tumor resection from 2003 to 2008 were reviewed. Possible clinical factors related to the postoperative recurrence were analyzed statistically. The specimens round the lesions were studied histopathologically. RESULTS: The overall recurrence rate was 39.3%. The postoperative recurrence rate of the patients with negative surgical margins and no tumor invasion of the major vessels and nerves was low (P < 0.05). However, the desmoid tumors could destroy the cortical bone and invade the medullary cavity. CONCLUSIONS: Desmoid tumors were pathologically benign, which could extensively invade tissues around the lesions. The invasion of major vessels and nerves and quality of surgical margins are the key factors for the high postoperative recurrence rate."
"Desmoid tumors are rare soft tissue tumors derived from fascia and connective tissue of the muscular layers. The abdominal region is the most frequent site of involvement, whereas involvement of sternal manubrium is rare. We report the case of a rare desmoid tumor in the sternal manubrium mimicking radiological and metabolic features of malignant tumor, which was successfully treated by sternal resection and reconstruction with autogenous rib grafts."

"Because desmoid tumors exhibit an unpredictable clinical course, translational research is crucial to identify the predictive factors of progression in addition to the clinical parameters. The main issue is to detect patients who are at a higher risk of progression. The aim of this work was to identify molecular markers that can predict progression-free survival (PFS). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene-expression screening was conducted on 115 available independent untreated primary desmoid tumors using cDNA microarray. We established a prognostic gene-expression signature composed of 36 genes. To test robustness, we randomly generated 1,000 36-gene signatures and compared their outcome association to our define 36-genes molecular signature and we calculated positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that our molecular signature had a significant impact on PFS while no clinical factor had any prognostic value. Among the 1,000 random signatures generated, 56.7% were significant and none was more significant than our 36-gene molecular signature. PPV and NPV were high (75.58% and 81.82%, respectively). Finally, the top two genes downregulated in no-recurrence were FECH and STOML2 and the top gene upregulated in no-recurrence was TRIP6. CONCLUSIONS: By analyzing expression profiles, we have identified a gene-expression signature that is able to predict PFS. This tool may be useful for prospective clinical studies."
"A 61-year-old woman who had undergone total hysterectomy 16 years previously exhibited a pelvic tumor on computed tomography (CT). F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) combined positron emission tomography (PET)/CT imaging revealed a solitary small focus of increased FDG activity in the pelvis. A gastrointestinal stromal tumor originating in the small intestine or another type of tumor originating in the mesentery (desmoid, schwannoma, or foreign body granuloma) was suspected; therefore, laparoscopic resection was conducted. A white, hard tumor was found to originate from the mesentery of the sigmoid colon and adhered slightly to the small intestine. The tumor was resected with a negative margin, and the pathologic diagnosis was suture granuloma. The possibility of suture granuloma should be kept in mind in cases of tumors with positive PET findings and a history of surgery close to the lesion. However, it is difficult to preoperatively diagnose pelvic tumors using a biopsy. Therefore, considering the possibility of malignancy, it is necessary to achieve complete resection without exposing the tumor."
"Expression of strong nuclear STAT6 is thought to be a specific marker for solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs). Little is known about subtle expression patterns in other mesenchymal lesions. METHODS: We performed immunohistochemical studies against the C-terminus of STAT6 in tissue microarrays and whole sections, comprising 2366 mesenchymal lesions. RESULTS: Strong nuclear STAT6 was expressed in 285 of 2,021 tumors, including 206 of 240 SFTs, 49 of 408 well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcomas, eight of 65 unclassified sarcomas, and 14 of 184 desmoid tumors, among others. Expression in SFTs was predominately limited to the nucleus. Other positive tumors typically expressed both nuclear and cytoplasmic STAT6. Complete absence of STAT6 was most common in pleomorphic liposarcoma and alveolar soft part sarcoma (60% and 72% cases negative, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Strong nuclear STAT6 is largely specific for SFTs. Physiologic low-level cytoplasmic/nuclear expression is common in mesenchymal neoplasia and is of uncertain significance."
"The term fibromatosis or desmoid tumor refers to a group of benign fibrous growths without metastatic potential but with a significant risk of local recurrence. These lesions typically present infiltrative growth pattern with local invasion of adjacent tissues. This tendency is the reason for a relatively high rate of local recurrence, even after surgical removal. Fibromatosis is a very rare condition in general population but occurs more frequently in one of the familial cancer predispositions known as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or Gardner syndrome. There are two main groups of fibromatosis: superficial (small, slow-growing lesions) and deep, also known as aggressive fibromatosis (large, rapid-growing lesions). CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 6-year-old boy suffering from an aggressive form of fibromatosis. The patient developed a large pathological mass extending from the neck to the loins. After incisional biopsy and histpoathological examination of the sample, a diagnosis of aggressive fibromatosis was established. During the whole diagnostic process, different imaging techniques including CT, MRI and sonoelastography were used. As the surgical treatment was not possible, the patient was finally qualified for chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Eventual diagnosis of aggressive fibromatosis is based on histopathological examination. However, it is an important condition that should be included in differential diagnosis of soft-tissue masses found in diagnostic imaging. Radiologists should be careful especially in defining the margins of infiltration in case of potential surgical treatment."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a benign spindle cell tumor with locally infiltrative behavior and tendency to recur. It has overlapping features with other spindle cell lesions and hence it is pertinent to be distinguished from them as they have different treatment modalities. We report a rare case involving the mandible of a two-month old infant with histopathological, immunohistochemical and imaging features."
"Omental fibromatosis (abdominal desmoids) is a rare benign but locally aggressive neoplasm characterized by mass like or infiltrative growth of fibrous tissue. It usually arises from the abdominal wall or the extremities, however rarely it may also arise in the omentum, ileocolic mesentery, transverse or sigmoid mesocolon and ligamentum teres. Here, we present an 18-year-old male, who presented with lower abdominal pain and palpable lump in hypogastric region. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed large heterogeneous mass in lower abdomen, possibly arising from mesentery with regional adenopathy. Patient underwent exploratory laparotomy with a preoperative diagnosis of mesenteric tumour possibly gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). Histopathological examination revealed the lesion as omental fibromatosis. To the best of our knowledge, very few cases of omental fibromatosis are noted in literature. Here, we describe a rare case of giant omental fibromatosis which resembled mesenteric GIST clinically but finally diagnosed as fibromatosis by histomorphology and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The present article describes fibromatosis of greater omentum and the difficulty in preoperative diagnosis, as it is frequently misdiagnosed as GIST."
"Fibromatosis are rare, accounting for 0.03% of all tumours. Mesenteric fibromatosis is a very rare (8% of all desmoid neoplasm). Aggressive fibromatosis of mesentery is a rare surgical problem affecting 2-4 per million people. Females are more commonly affected than males (Estrogen acts as a growth factor). It is locally invasive and tends to recur but never metastasize. Here, we are discussing about 24-year-old male presented with progressive abdomen distension associated with pain since one month. Abdominal examination showed a firm non-tender intra-abdominal mass, measuring around 15x14 cm size, with intrinsic mobility, which was perpendicular to mesenteric line, all borders were well-made out. CECT abdomen showed features suggestive of GIST . Elective Laparotomy was done and a giant mass arising from mesentery without any infiltration to the surrounding structures was noted. The entire mass was excised and mesentery repaired. Histopathology showed uniform band of spindle shaped cells arranged in fascicles admixed with blood vessels in a collagenous stroma. Immunohistochemistry showed Beta Catenin +ve, CD 117-ve, CD 34 -ve and SMA-ve, which is confirmative of Fibromatosis. Postoperative period was uneventful."
"mutation-specific restriction enzyme digestion and polymerase chain reaction amplification. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded needle biopsy or resection tissue sections from 144 patients with sporadic desmoid-type fibromatoses, four patients with syndrome-related desmoid-type fibromatoses and 11 morphological mimics. Two primer pairs were designed for CTNNB1 mutation hotspots. Using >/=10 ng of DNA, libraries were generated by Fluidigm and sequenced on the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine. Next-generation sequencing had a sensitivity of 92.36 % (133/144, 95 % CIs: 86.74 to 96.12 %) and a specificity of 100 % for the detection of CTNNB1 mutations in desmoid-type fibromatoses-like spindle cell lesions. All mutations detected by mutation-specific restriction enzyme digestion were identified by next-generation sequencing. Next-generation sequencing identified additional mutations in 11 tumours that were not detected by mutation-specific restriction enzyme digestion, two of which have not been previously described. Next-generation sequencing is highly sensitive for the detection of CTNNB1 mutations. This multiplex assay has the advantage of detecting additional mutations compared to those detected by mutation-specific restriction enzyme digestion (sensitivity 82.41 %). The technology requires minimal DNA and is time- and cost-efficient."
"Low-grade fibromatosis-like spindle cell carcinoma is a rare tumor in the breast, and represents a variant of the very heterogeneous group of metaplastic carcinomas of the breast. These tumors warrant distinction because of their resemblance to pure fibromatosis, their propensity for local recurrence, and their favorable prognosis among the metaplastic carcinomas of the breast. The diagnosis is potentially challenging, particularly on core needle biopsies, because of the morphologic overlap with other low-grade spindle cell lesions. Recognition of a proliferation of cytologically bland spindle cells with areas of epithelial differentiation in combination with immunohistochemistry using antibodies against cytokeratins and myoepithelial markers should aid in producing a definitive diagnosis. These tumors can be locally aggressive with an increased incidence of local recurrence, but the potential for lymph node or distant metastasis is low. Complete excision with adequate margins is considered curative in the majority of cases."

"Desmoid tumors are rare soft tissue tumors derived from musculoaponeurotic structures of the abdominal wall musculature. Although they are considered benign tumors because they don't metastasize to other parts of the body, they are clinically considered as malignant for their high tendency on infiltrative growth with local invasion and trend to recurrence after local excision. Several reconstructive techniques are proposed in the literature. METHODS: Nine female patients with abdominal desmoid tumors underwent the removal of a mass of tissue running from the skin to peritoneum near the tumor with a safety margin in macroscopically normal tissue at least of 5 centimeters from the edge of the tumor. After wide excision, a polypropylene mesh was placed in the rear muscular pocket without anchoring suture (sliding mesh sutureless hernioplasty) RESULTS: No patients had perioperative complications or abdominal wall weakness or an incisional hernia in the following 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: We consider this technique of abdominal wall reconstruction after desmoid tumor removal a simple procedure that reduces relapsing events and recurrences of abdominal hernia, reducing tension and pain caused by the traditional suture repair technique. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV."
"Gingival fibromatosis is an enlargement of the gingival tissue, which may be localized or generalized, characterized by hypertrophy and proliferation of the connective tissue, predominantly Type I collagen, with occasional presence of an increased number of cells, supposedly fibroblasts. Gingival fibromatosis occurs more commonly as a side- effect of systemic drugs, such as phenytoin, cyclosporine, nifedipine, or due to hereditary factors. However, in some cases, it is idiopathic. We report one such case in 30 -year- old - female who presented with a complaint of swelling of gums since 2 months. This case appears to be of special interest because of the recurrent nature of gingival enlargement along with excessive osseous destruction."
"Fibromatosis of the breast, also known as a desmoid tumor, is extremely rare and most often appears as an aggressive lesion mimicking breast carcinoma. It lacks metastatic potential but can grow aggressively in a localized area. Ultrasonography often shows an irregular spiculated hypoechoic mass with posterior acoustic shadowing. We discuss a case of breast fibromatosis that presented as a painful palpable breast mass in a 32-year-old woman and mimicked an abscess in the sonogram. We found that this lesion displayed atypical sonographic features such as a heterogeneous echoic mass with an internal anechoic area."
"Fibrous, myofibroblastic, and fibrohistiocytic soft-tissue tumours are amongst the most common benign soft-tissue lesions encountered in clinical practice. They demonstrate varied biological behaviour and imaging characteristics. Benign fibroblastic lesions, such as nodular fasciitis, are small, have a self-limited course, and rarely recur after excision, whereas deep fibromatosis and plexiform fibrohistiocytic tumours tend to exhibit more aggressive features and often have high recurrence rates. MRI with its superior tissue contrast, multiplanar imaging capability, and lack of ionising radiation is regarded as the preferred method of tumour evaluation, tissue characterisation, and assessment of treatment response. Histopathological features are depicted at MRI, reflecting the amount and distribution of the cellular and fibrous matrix. Cellular tumours tend to show higher T2 signal intensity and post-contrast enhancement as compared to tumours with greater collagenous content, which appear dark and show less enhancement. Awareness of MR characteristics, pathological behaviour, and common sites of occurrence of fibrous soft-tissue tumours will help radiologists to determine the appropriate differential diagnosis and guide patient management."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is a rare entity that predominantly involves the extremities, the trunk, and the abdominal cavity. It is a non-metastasizing, sporadic mesenchymal tumor with high tendency to recurrence and often is categorized as low-grade sarcoma. CASE REPORT: We present here an extremely rare case of a mesenteric desmoid tumor (DT). A 40-year-old man presented to our clinic with a mass in the right-lower quadrant of the abdomen, which he incidentally palpated. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed a mass between the loops of small intestine. The patient was treated successfully with wide excision of involved mesentery and adjacent small intestine. Histopathology of the mass revealed DT of the mesentery. No adjuvant treatment was applied and the patient was free of disease after a 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-abdominal DF is a rare pathology which should be differentiated while exploring abdominal tumors. Surgery, when dealing with operable masses, is the appropriate treatment."
"Intraperitoneal solid tumors are far less common in children than in adults, and the histologic spectrum of neoplasms of the peritoneum and its specialized folds in young patients differs from that in older patients. Localized masses may be caused by inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, Castleman disease, mesenteric fibromatosis, or other mesenchymal masses. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor is a mesenchymal tumor of borderline biologic potential that appears as a solitary circumscribed mass, possibly with central calcification. Castleman disease is an idiopathic lymphoproliferative disorder that appears as a circumscribed, intensely enhancing mass in the mesentery. Mesenteric fibromatosis, or intra-abdominal desmoid tumor, is a benign tumor of mesenchymal origin associated with familial adenomatous polyposis. Mesenteric fibromatosis appears as a mildly enhancing, circumscribed solitary mass without metastases. Diffuse peritoneal disease may be due to desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or rhabdomyosarcoma. DSRCT is a rare member of the small round blue cell tumor family that causes diffuse peritoneal masses without a visible primary tumor. A dominant mass is typically found in the retrovesical space. Burkitt lymphoma is a pediatric tumor that manifests with extensive disease because of its short doubling time. The bowel and adjacent mesentery are commonly involved. Rhabdomyosarcoma may arise as a primary tumor of the omentum or may spread from a primary tumor in the bladder, prostate, or scrotum. Knowledge of this spectrum of disease allows the radiologist to provide an appropriate differential diagnosis and suggest proper patient management."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a rare soft tissue tumor that composes of myofibroblasts that arise from musculoaponeurotic structures. It usually affects the abdominal wall but may be also found in other less common sites including the head and neck, submucosa of the oral cavity, spinal, haunch and limbs, especially, the limbs and sacrococcygeal region are rare locations. We described two cases of aggressive fibromatosis. One was 3-year-old girl with aggressive fibromatosis arising from the right leg region. The other was 20-year-old female arising from in the sacrococcygeal region. They were resected with satisfied results. Pathological examination showed that they were composed of fibroblasts, fibrocytes and bundles of collagen fiber. The aggressive fibromatosis, although rare, should be differentiated from some other soft tissue tumors with similar histological features and different localizations of intra-abdominal, abdominal wall and extra-abdominal."
"Desmoid disease can be a serious, life-threatening complication of familial adenomatous polyposis. The ability to predict patients at increased desmoid risk is important, but a convincing genotype-phenotype correlation for desmoid formation has not yet been described. PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between desmoid disease and genotype in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. DESIGN: This is a cohort study. PATIENTS: All patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and a documented pathogenic APC mutation in themselves or a first-degree relative were selected. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The comparison of genotype and the presence, stage, and site of desmoid disease are the primary end points of this study. RESULTS: Three hundred twenty-three patients from 219 families were identified. Mutations spanned the length of the gene, from codon 213 to codon 2051. Desmoid disease was diagnosed in 77 patients from 68 families. Desmoid disease was found in 14.9% of patients with a mutation 5' of codon 400, 23.2% of patients with a mutation from codon 401 to 1400, and in 37.1% of those with a mutation 3' of 1400. All patients with 5' mutations had stage I or II abdominal desmoid disease, and all tumors were stable or shrinking. Twelve percent of patients who had desmoid disease with mutations between codons 400 and 1400 had stage III or IV desmoid disease, and 5 of 42 (12%) tumors were growing at the time of the study. There had been 2 desmoid-related deaths. Almost half (44%) of patients who had desmoid disease with mutations 3' of codon 1400 had stage III or IV disease. Three of 14 tumors were growing (21%), and there were 4 desmoid-related deaths. LIMITATIONS: This study was conducted at a tertiary referral center, and there was no systematic surveillance for desmoids. CONCLUSION: Desmoid disease occurs in patients who have familial adenomatous polyposis with almost any APC mutation, although there is an increased propensity in those with a 3' mutation. The incidence and severity of the desmoid disease are related to the site of the mutation."
"The French Patient Advocacy Group SOS Desmoid conducted a survey to measure the pain burden of desmoid tumor patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used a structured questionnaire to measure the occurrence and consequences of pain. RESULTS: The pain occurrence was approximately 63%. In one-third of the cases, the pain was permanent. This pain led to severe social and economic consequences. DISCUSSION: The occurrence of pain and its consequences are underestimated among these patients. Pain needs to be closely and precisely measured and monitored in future clinical trials to assess the efficacy of proposed treatments better."
"The optimal management of desmoid fibromatosis remains unclear, leading to significant variability in patient management. To assess this problem, the current approach of clinicians managing this complex condition in the UK was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A hypothetical case of intramuscular limb girdle desmoid fibromatosis in a fit 65-year-old patient was devised. Surgical and non-surgical oncology members of the British Sarcoma Group were questioned on how they would manage this case in three scenarios: primary disease with function-sparing surgery possible, primary disease with neurovascular involvement and disease recurrence after a previous R0 resection. Initial management, management of symptomatic disease progression, follow-up preferences and any differences in respondents' management choices in a younger case were investigated. RESULTS: The responses from 14 sarcoma surgeons and 23 oncologists (14 clinical, nine medical) were analysed. Desmoid fibromatosis management is generally shared by surgeons and oncologists within sarcoma multidisciplinary teams in the UK. Variation exists in the chosen initial management of primary desmoid fibromatosis in the UK, with function-sparing surgery possible (observation 51%, resection 51%), primary desmoid fibromatosis with neurovascular involvement (hormone therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 51%, radiotherapy 27%, observation 22%) and for cases of desmoid fibromatosis recurrence (radiotherapy 41%, hormone therapy and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 27%, observation 24%). There was a clear preference of surgical resection of symptomatic disease progression in cases of primary desmoid fibromatosis without neurovascular involvement (60%). By contrast, radiotherapy was the preferred treatment for progression in cases with neurovascular involvement (47%) or cases of recurrence after a previous R0 resection (34%). Clinical follow-up was selected 3 months after intervention in 68% of scenarios. Follow-up imaging was selected 3 or 6 months after intervention in 57% and 21% of cases, respectively. Most respondents would not change their chosen management in younger patients. DISCUSSION: Several groups have issued formal guidelines for clinicians managing desmoid fibromatosis, including the British Sarcoma Group, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the European Society for Medical Oncology. However, these are in some ways contradictory and may not reflect recent publications, potentially explaining the significant variation in the management of desmoid fibromatosis in the UK shown by this survey. We propose a review of current evidence; a national consensus or a desmoid fibromatosis registry may help to standardise desmoid fibromatosis care."
"Desmoid tumors are fibroblastic neoplasms that have an intermediate behavior with a highly aggressive infiltrative growth arising from deep muscle or aponeurosis. We present the case of a 34-year-old woman that developed a painless mass in the right popliteal fossa during pregnancy after intracytoplasmic sperm injection and hormonal therapy. The MRI scan showed a hyperintense mass of 6,7 cm x 4,7 cm x 3,8 cm surrounding the lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle. The open biopsy was done one week after delivery, and the histology showed a desmoid tumor. We performed the resection one week later and found the common peroneal nerve completely surrounded by the tumor. The close resection due to the neurolysis was the reason why an adjuvant radiation with 56 Gy was done. The last clinical examination, 18 month later, did not show any signs of recurrence and an excellent functional outcome. This case demonstrates the possible influences of pregnancy and hormonal therapy on the evolution of desmoid tumors."
"The most suitable management of recurrent abdominal desmoid tumor is still unclear. A case of recurrent huge abdominal desmoid tumor successfully treated by hyperthermia therapy is described. A 63-year-old man was operated upon for desmoid tumor in the retroperitoneum involving pancreas, posterior wall of the stomach and transverse mesocolon in 2007. In 2008, the tumor recurred and could not be resected because of the patient refused the operation. Several therapies using tamoxifen, anastrozole, imatinib mesylate and radiotherapy were all ineffective. The tumor grew bigger and bigger during a treatment period. Finally, hyperthermia treatment was applied to the tumor. The size of the recurrent desmoid tumor reduced 75% by hyperthermia treatment for 46-month. Base on this experience, we recommend hyperthermia as the treatment for patients with recurrent abdominal desmoid tumor that several therapeutic strategies did not achieve a remarkable response."
"The patient was a 48-year-old woman who was diagnosed with early gastric cancer during a long-term follow-up period for Gardner syndrome. Subtotal colectomy for colon leiomyoma was performed when the patient was 22 years old. Partial resection of the ileum was performed for ileum leiomyoma at the age of 27. Total resection of the remaining colon with ileostomy was performed for a pelvic desmoid tumor at the age of 40. In addition, resection of a desmoid tumor of the abdominal wall was performed 8 times in the 25 years since the first operation. During the follow-up for gastric polyps associated with Gardner syndrome, gastric cancer was detected from biopsy specimens of a wide range of the fundus polyps. Endoscopic resection was considered not to be applicable because of the extensive nature of the lesion. Total gastrectomy was also considered not to be applicable because of concerns about short bowel syndrome due to intestinal reconstruction. Therefore, proximal gastrectomy with esophagogastric anastomosis was performed. The pathological diagnosis was 0-IIa, 70 x 44 mm, tub1, m, ly0, v0, n0, PM (-), DM (-), stageIA. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day (POD) 16. We speculate that long-term survival of patients with Gardner syndrome without severe short bowel syndrome might result in carcinogenesis of gastric polyps."
"We report on a 30-year-old man with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP ) who developed advanced sigmoid colon cancer with desmoid tumors. The patient initially presented with melena. FAP advanced sigmoid colon cancer was diagnosed following a laparoscopy-assisted proctocolectomy in 2007. A computed tomography (CT) scan, conducted 7 months later, revealed a tumor around the branch of the common iliac artery. We diagnosed sigmoid colon cancer recurrence and attempted treatment by surgical removal. However, there were many smooth tumors within the patient's abdomen, which were diagnosed as desmoid tumors using rapid intraoperative pathological diagnosis. Although the patient was administered a COX-2 inhibitor and tamoxifen after surgery, the tumor grew. Dacarbazine (DTIC) and doxorubicin (DOX) were subsequently administered to the patient, and after 4 courses, the tumor was reduced by 60% and stable disease (SD) was achieved. In 2009, a CT scan indicated sigmoid colon cancer recurrence in the liver. The patient underwent a left hepatic lobectomy by laparoscopy-assisted surgery. To date, 4 years and 6 months after surgery, we have been unable to find new disease or desmoid tumor growth."
"Mammary fibromatosis is an uncommon, benign tumor of the breast. It is locally aggressive and has a high rate of recurrence. Its clinical presentation and imaging results always call for suspicion of malignancy. Here we describe a case of mammary fibromatosis with clinical manifestation, radiographic and pathologic results, and imaging findings from ultrasound elastography."
"hierarchical clustering of these 15 miRNAs identified two groups, in which time to recurrence was statistically different (28.8 months vs 68.8 months). These results provide the first indication of the prognostic value of miRNA expression profiling with a possible direct impact on patient management. A more precise miRNA signature must now be determined to select patients who would not benefit from surgical resection of their tumor and who ought to be monitored without treatment."
"Desmoid tumors (DTs) is a benign tumor with high tendency to infiltrative evolution and recurrence. Nowadays, in abdominal localization, the standard approach is surgery with R0 condition. The need to repair post-surgical wide wall defect requires conservative technique to decrease the incidence of incisional hernia and to obtain better quality of life (QoL). METHODS: We perform an abdominal wall desmoid resection using ultrasound guide. This technique ensures to spare a wide wall area and to obtain a multilayer reconstruction minimizing postoperative risk. This approach allows good oncological results and better managing abdominal wall post-resection defect. RESULTS: We use US guided surgery to get radical approach and wall tissue spare that allows us a multilayer reconstruction minimizing post-operative complications. No recurrences were observed in one year follow up period. CONCLUSION: Our experience represents first step to consider ultrasound mediated technique usefull to optimize wall resection surgery and to minimize following complications."
"inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, n=1; alveolar soft part sarcoma, n=2; leiomyosarcoma, n=10; well-differentiated liposarcoma, n=7; pleomorphic liposarcoma, n=2; extraskeletal osteosarcoma, n=1; epithelioid sarcoma, n=1; synovial sarcoma, n=4; malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, n=4; undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, n=19; rhabdomyosarcoma, n=6; myxofibrosarcoma, n=8; myxoid liposarcoma, n=11; fibrosarcoma, n=4; and desmoid-type fibromatosis, n=1. ALK protein expression, gene signal gain (without translocation), and phosphorylation were observed in 33/81 (40.7%), 55/81 (67.9%), and 30/81 (37.0%) tumor samples, respectively. ALK protein expression was statistically associated with phosphorylation, but not with gene signal gain. ALK phosphorylation-positive cases showed a statistically worse metastasis-free survival compared with phosphorylation-negative cases (P=0.0215). Particularly, metastasis of myxoid liposarcoma was associated with ALK phosphorylation (P=0.0019), but not with ALK protein expression or gene signal gain. However, the prognosis had no association with ALK protein expression, gene signal gain, or phosphorylation. ALK protein expression and phosphorylation play an important role in tumor biology and provide potential therapeutic targets for soft tissue tumors. Future research should focus on the oncogenic role and the efficacy of potential inhibitors of ALK."
"We present the case of an abdominal wall soft tissue mass with intense FDG uptake in a 61-year-old man with unintentional weight loss. The appearance of this mass and high focal FDG uptake mimics high-grade sarcoma on (18)F-FDG PET/CT. However, the final excisional histopathological diagnosis was desmoid fibromatosis."
"Perineal soft tissue tumors are rare, so that little is known about their management and the outcome of treatment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe the presentation, management, and outcome of the surgical treatment of soft tissue tumors and to provide a final decision algorithm. DESIGN: This is a retrospective study. SETTINGS: The study was conducted in a single tertiary care hospital with a dedicated unit on sarcoma. PATIENTS: Fifty-one consecutive patients from 1998 to 2013 were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes measured are patient demographics, treatment decisions, and outcome of surgical treatment. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients presented with a primary soft tissue tumor, and 2 underwent simple excisions for isolated metastases. The median tumor size was 75 mm (50-110). Symptoms were nonspecific, and MRI had insufficient specificity for malignancy so that a preoperative biopsy was systematically performed according to European Society for Medical Oncology and National Comprehensive Cancer Network soft tissue tumor guidelines. Six benign soft tissue tumors (3 lipomas, 3 leiomyomas), 16 intermediate soft tissue tumors (12 aggressive angiomyxoma, 4 desmoid tumors), and 27 sarcomas were identified. Treatments and surgery were tailored from the beginning according to histology. All but 1 benign soft tissue tumor were treated by 'shelling out.' Aggressive angiomyxoma were treated with en bloc resection sparing uninvolved organs. Nonsurgical treatments were our first choice for desmoid tumors. Wide en bloc surgery was planned for all sarcomas (n = 27) after the induction treatment for 16 patients (chemotherapy, n = 12; radiotherapy, n = 4). In the sarcoma group, the 5-year estimated metastasis-free, local recurrence-free, and overall survival rates were 68.1% (95% CI, 50.7-91.5), 84.7% (95% CI, 66.7-100), and 85.7% (95% CI, 71.8-100). In the benign and intermediate tumor groups, there were no deaths, local recurrences, or progression. LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by the small number of patients, given the rarity of this disease in the perineum. CONCLUSION: We provide useful indications for the best strategy necessary to treat these rare tumors located in a complex site."
"Surgical resection of large desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) of the shoulder girdle is challenging. This article discusses the operative approach and evaluates the clinic outcome. METHOD: Twenty-one cases between June 2003 and June 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Eleven patients newly diagnosed and ten had previous operations. Mean tumour size was 10.5 cm (range, 7.0-19.0 cm). We divided the shoulder girdle into four regions; the adopted surgical resection was en bloc in 18 cases and piecemeal resection in three. In nine cases we took an anterior approach, ten a posterior approach and two a combined anteroposterior (AP) approach. Brachytherapy with permanent I(125) implantation was applied in all cases. RESULT: All 21 patients were followed up for a mean of 49.8 (range, 18-136) months. Recurrence was seen in two patients, with the overall recurrence rate of 9.5 %. The Musculoskeletal Tumour Score (MSTS) was between 56.7 and 96.7 %, with the average at 78.9 % and excellent-good rate 95.2 %. Complications were found in three of the 21 patients (14.3 %). CONCLUSION: Surgical resection with the precondition of preserving vital structure for large DTF of the shoulder girdle is necessary. According to our new partition, it was suitable to take an anterior approach when regions I or I + II were involved, posterior approach for regions II, III or II + III; combined AP approach when involving region I + II + III; and anterior or posterior approach for region IV, depending upon tumour location."
"A 46-year-old man presented to our hospital for further examination following a positive fecal occult blood test. He also had a painless, palpable scrotal mass that had been present for several years, but he had not previously sought treatment. Colonoscopy demonstrated multiple adenomatous polyps and colon cancer ; when taken together with his family history, these findings led to the diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis. A computed tomography scan revealed a right intrascrotal tumor, and the patient was referred to our department. Together with digestive surgeons, we carried out scrotal mass resection and colectomy under general anesthesia. On scrotal exploration, a large, solid mass was identified ; it was separate from the testis and epididymis. Although the mass was adhered to the surface of the corpus cavernosum penis, we were able to completely resect the mass along with part of the corpus cavernosum penis. The tumor was composed of abundant collagen fibers and mature fibroblasts. Histopathology revealed the right scrotal mass to be a desmoid tumor. The patient is alive with no evidence of disease 24 months after surgery."
"Desmoid tumors are rare soft-tissue masses originating from the proliferation of fibroblasts in the fibroconnective tissues. Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors pose special diagnostic challenge due to multiplicity of differential diagnoses, and difficulty to well characterize the lesions on imaging studies. Desmoid tumors can have atypical presentation making clinical correlation challenging to unsuspecting urologists. Only a few cases have been reported in the urology literature. In this report, we present a case of desmoid tumor presenting with gross hematuria."
"To report initial results of observation as well as surgery in patients with desmoid tumors (DTs) of the breast, a rare tumor for which data are scarce. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The initial approaches were categorized as either front-line loco-regional treatment [(surgery or radiotherapy group, SRG) n = 20] or initial observation [(no surgery/no radiotherapy group, NSRG) n = 11]. RESULTS: A total of 27 women and 4 men were assessed between 1992 and 2013 and included in this study. Patient characteristics were adequately balanced in the 2 groups. Fifteen patients (48.4%) had a past history of breast surgery in the previous 24 months. The median initial DT size on MRI was 50 mm. The median follow-up was 36 months. In the SRG, 8/20 patients (40%) experienced recurrence. The median time to recurrence was 29 months. During the study period, 6 patients in the SRG (30%) received a mastectomy at the time of diagnosis (n = 3) or at relapse (n = 3), 7 patients (35%) received a thoracic wall resection and 8 patients (40%) received radiotherapy at the time of diagnosis (n = 2) or at recurrence (n = 5). In the NSRG, the median tumor size change was -4 mm (range -13 to +20). Three patients changed treatment strategies during the observation period; one received surgery, and 2 were administered anti-hormonal treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Loco-regional treatments of breast DTs resulted in undesired disfigurement. Front-line observation yielded encouraging results and could enable the identification of patients who require loco-regional treatment. This strategy needs further evaluation."
"Desmoid tumors (fibromatosis) are rare benign tumors, they arise from musculoaponeurotic structures throughout the body. They are locally infiltrative, resulting in a high rate of local recurrence following surgical resection. Due to the rarity of these tumors in the head and neck region, we report a case of a patient with a desmoid tumor in the upper neck that was diagnosed and treated in our institution, to increase the awareness of the Otolaryngology-Head and Neck surgeons, and report available treatment options of this condition."
"Podoplanin, D2-40, has been described in a variety of normal and neoplastic tissues. It is often used for highlighting lymphatics. We evaluated the expression of podoplanin in alpha-smooth muscle actinpositive myofibroblasts producing the suburothelial layer in tunica propria of the urinary bladder that have some similar features with telocytes. Our results showed that these cells demonstrate distinct D2-40 immunoreactivity from telocytes occurring in the renal pelvis and ureter. We observed positive reaction not only in bioptic specimens from women with interstitial cystitis, but also in a control group of women and men treated for pathological bladder lesion different from interstitial cystitis. It is interesting that identical staining reaction was observed in the ureters only exceptionally. In addition, we examined samples from myofibroblastic tumoriform lesions of soft tissue such as nodular fascitis and fibromatosis (desmoid) and we obtained negative results. It means that the so-called myofibroblasts of urinary bladder tunica propria have a unique immunophenotype that has probably not been described until now. Our findings suggest that D2-40 can be used as a complementary immunostainer to alpha-smooth muscle actin on urinary bladder biopsies from patients with interstitial cystitis. The role of D2-40 as an immunohistochemical marker is still being investigated."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a broad group of benign fibrous tissue proliferations of similar microscopic appearance that are intermediate in their biological behavior between benign fibrous tissues and fibrosarcomas. They are rare lesions accounting for less than 3 % of all soft tissue tumours. Usual site is extremity whereas head and neck fibromatosis is a rare occurrence. We present a case of aggressive fibromatosis of the infratemporal fossa in a child, which was treated by surgical excision with adjuvant hormonal therapy."
"To explorer the diagnostic rationales for primary pelvic retroperitoneal tumors and summarize their clinical characteristics and treatments. METHODS: The clinicopathological data of total of 36 patients with primary pelvic retroperitoneal tumor, who visited Peking Union Medical Collage Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences because of pelvic mass from January 1986 and September 2013 were analysed retrospectively. And their clinical manifestations, accessory examination, surgical findings, postoperative pathological results and prognosis were summarized. RESULTS: Among the 36 patients, twenty-nine cases were treated by gynecology department firstly, 7 cases were treated by surgical department firstly. Only 7 cases complained abdominal expanding while others had no uncomfortable complains before the discovery of the tumor. Among 27 cases who took color Doppler ultrasonography examination, only 3 cases reminded that the tumors might come from the pelvic retroperitoneal space. CT and MRI results were respectively 6/16 and 3/6, that the tumor might come from the pelvic retroperitoneal space. The level of CA125 of 18 cases were tested before the surgery: 17 out of 18 cases were normal or elevated lightly. The tumors of 8 cases were excised incompletely because of the blood vessels around the tumors and the close relationship between the tumors and the pelvic wall, while other's were excised completely. Among the 25 cases that had operation at the gynecological department, ten cases underwent operations collaboratively with surgical department; two cases had complications of urinary system injures. Postoperative pathological examinations revealed there were 28 cases (78%, 28/36)with benign lesions including 11 schwannoma, 6 leiomyoma, 3 teratoma, 1 lymphangioleiomyoma, 1 neurofibroma, 1 paraganglioma, 2 fibromatosis, 1 aggressive angiomyxoma, 1 mucinous cystadenoma and 1 solitary fibrous tumor; and 8 cases(22% , 8/36)with malignant lesions including 3 leiomyosarcoma, 2 liposarcoma, 2 adenocarcinoma and 1 squamous carcinoma. During the follow-up period, 28 cases whose tumors were excised completely had no recurrence. While, 3 out of 8 cases excised incompletely recurred. CONCLUSIONS: Primary pelvic retroperitoneal tumors have no typical manifestations, CT and MRI are more accurate. Surgery is a key for retroperitoneal tumors. Considering the complexity of the anatomy of the pelvic retroperitoneal space and the resulted difficulties of the surgeries, multidisiciplinary cooperation is needed and important."
"It is presented the treatment results of abdominal and intraabdominal desmoid fibromas. Group of abdominal localization included 19 patients. 15 of them had primary tumors, 4 - recurrent tumors after surgical treatment. Radical (R0) operations were performed in all cases. Tumor removal was associated with plastic of abdominal wall by synthetic implant in 17 patients. Wide excision of surrounding tissues and musculo-aponeurotic layer of anterior abdominal wall allows to achieve long-term disease-free period. There weren't recurrent symptoms in terms from 4 to 60 months of observation. The second group included 28 patients with intraabdominal desmoid fibromas. Operations were performed in 11 (35.2%) patients including 3 cases of reoperations. There were 14 operations. Radical (R0) volume was applied in 11 (78.6%) operations, cytoreductive (R2) volume - in 1 (7%) operation. Explorative laparotomy was used in 3 (21.4%) cases because of involvement of mesenteric vessels. Combined treatment was performed in 4 (14.3%) patients. 14 (50%) patients received conservative therapy because of unresectable tumor including chemo-, hormone- and radiotherapy. Operated patients were under observation in terms from 11 to 156 months, median was 63.2 months. Recurrence developed in 4 of 10 (40%) patients after R0-surgery. Cytoreductive (R1/R2) volume is admitted for intraabdominal desmoid fibromas. But even in case of unresectable process and explorative intervention stabilization and regression of tumor is possible by means of chemo-, hormone- and radiotherapy in different combination. It allows to preserve a good life quality."
"Desmoid tumors (DTs) are rare myofibroblastic neoplasms, which are mostly sporadic, but sometimes associated with familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome. Neurosurgical cases of DT have been very scarce. We review the literature concerning neurosurgical DTs and describe the first case of a cicatricial DT after the resection of vestibular schwannoma, presenting as a painful swelling in the retrosigmoid scar. Contrary to other localizations in the body, standard-of-care wide margin resection cannot be performed in intracranial and spinal DTs. Therefore, maximally safe resection followed by radiotherapy when tumor margins are not free can be proposed as a treatment strategy in neurosurgical DTs."
"The incidence of other primary neoplasms in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patients is relatively high. Our aim was to better characterize the clinicopathologic and molecular relationships in a cohort of GIST patients. METHODS: All GIST patients with tumor samples sent for molecular testing were identified via electronic medical records. Clinicopathologic characteristics of GIST and additional primary malignancies were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 260 patients, 50 (19 %) had at least one additional primary malignancy. In 33 patients, separate primary neoplasms predated their GIST diagnosis and most commonly included: prostate (n = 9), breast (n = 8), and hematologic (n = 5). Renal (n = 4) and hematologic (n = 3) malignancies were the most frequent cancers identified after GIST diagnosis. The majority (8 of 12, 66 %) of malignancies diagnosed after GIST were found incidentally. Patients who developed other malignancies after GIST more often had KIT exon 11 mutations (100 vs. 66 %, P = 0.01). In comparison to patients with only GIST, patients with a second primary neoplasm of any chronology had GISTs with increased mitotic rate (>/=5 per 50 high-power fields) (P = 0.0006). Literature review revealed colorectal cancer, gastric, prostate, renal, leukemia, and desmoid-type fibromatosis as the most common secondary neoplasms. CONCLUSIONS: Nineteen percent of GIST patients develop other malignancies. This is the first report to describe a relationship between additional primary malignancy and both mutation and mitotic rate of GIST. Although the basis of these relationships remains to be investigated, caution in the clinical management of GIST patients with additional lesions is warranted."
"Desmoid tumors (DTs) are rare, mesenchymal tumors that exhibit features of an abundant wound healing process. Previously, we showed that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are constituents of DTs and may contribute to desmoid tumorigenesis via activities associated with wound healing. Hyaluronan (HA) is a long-charged chain of repeating glucuronate and N-acetylglucosamine disaccharides that is synthesized by HA synthases (HAS) and degraded by hyaluronidases (HYAL). HA is secreted into the extracellular matrix by injured stroma and is important for normal tissue repair and neoplastic progression. Here, we investigated the presence of HA in DTs and the antitumor effects of the HA inhibitor, 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU), on DT-derived mesenchymal cells. By immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we found abundant expression of HA in 29/30 DTs as well as >5-fold increased HA levels in DT-derived cell lines relative to controls. Immunohistochemistry also demonstrated high expression of HAS2 in DTs, and quantitative PCR analysis showed increased HAS2 upregulation in frozen DTs and DT-derived cells. 4-MU treatment of DT-derived cells significantly decreased proliferation as well as HA and HAS2 levels. Fluorescent immunohistochemistry showed that MSCs in DTs coexpressed HA, HAS2, HYAL2, as well as the major HA receptor CD44 and HA coreceptor TLR4. Taken together, our results suggest that paracrine regulation of HA signaling in DTs may contribute to MSC recruitment and tumor proliferation. Future studies investigating the role of HA in tumor-stroma crosstalk and inhibition of HA-MSC interactions as a novel therapeutic target in DTs and other solid tumors are warranted."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) is a ""locally aggressive, but not metastasizing"" proliferation of soft tissues that is difficult to diagnose pre-operatively. Surgical en bloc resection of abdominal DTF can be difficult or an overtreatment. The diagnosis is therefore crucial for the decision making to minimize unnecessary morbidity. CASE REPORT: A 33-year old female patient with an incidental intra-operative diagnosis of a 20 cm mesenteric mass involving the duodenum, jejunum, ileum and right colon underwent extended resection for a DTF. A review of the literature, limited only to mesenteric localization of DTF, was performed for the diagnosis, treatment and outcome. RESULTS: Twentyfive cases of DTF have been analyzed. Pre-operative diagnosis was suspected in 20% but 95,2% of all the patients underwent resection without pre-operative diagnosis. In two cases, intra-operative, frozen section diagnosis was unsuccessfully attempted. Complications were reported in 12%, recurrence in 4%, and mortality in 0% of the patients. CONCLUSION: Pre-operative diagnosis of mesenteric DTF is challenging in most cases, but it can avoid unnecessary extended surgery. Efforts should be made to achieve a correct pre-operative diagnosis based on more reliable imaging and pathological features, to help in decision making."
"Desmoid tumor is a benign tumor which originates from musculoaponeurotic system, can reach greater sizes with local invasion among facial plans, and cause severe deformities, morbidity and even mortality by compression of adjacent structures. These tumors are rarely seen in the head and neck region. The treatment of advanced desmoid tumors of head and neck region is surgery and radiotherapy. In this paper, we present -to the best of our knowledge- the greatest desmoid tumor case of the head and neck region in the literature."
"To analyse the natural history of extra-abdominal wall desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) and compare outcome in patients who underwent initial surgery with those who did not. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All consecutive patients affected by primary sporadic extra-abdominal wall DF observed between January 1992 and December 2012 were included. Patients were divided into surgical (SG) or non-surgical groups (NSG) according to initial treatment. Relapse free survival was calculated for SG, and crude cumulative incidence (CCI) of switching to surgery or other treatments for NSG. RESULTS: 216 patients were identified, 94 in SG (43%), 122 in NSG (57%). A shift towards a more systematic use of a conservative approach (78% of all comers) was observed in the latter years (2006-2012), although a small proportion of patients (28%) had been offered the conservative strategy even in the early period (1992-2005). Median follow-up (FU) was 49 mo. (interquartile (IQ), 20-89 mo.), 76 months for SG and 39 months for NSG. 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) for SG was 80% (95% confidence interval (CI), 72-89%). For the NSG, 5-year CCI of switching to surgery was 5% (95% CI: 1.7%, 14%), and 51% to other treatments (95% CI: 41%, 65%). 27 (20%) NSG patients underwent spontaneous regression. CONCLUSION: A non-surgical approach to extra-abdominal wall DF allowed surgery to be avoided in the majority of patients. This approach can be safely proposed and surgery offered as an option in selected cases."
"Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is a major therapeutic option for the management of unresectable aggressive fibromatosis. Unfortunately, for most patients of low or very low average income countries, surgery often is the first treatment option. This is related to unavailability of chemotherapy or targeted therapy, and to a lack of financial resources or surgeons' lack of knowledge of other therapeutic options. CASE PRESENTATION: In 2010, a 26-year-old Moroccan man was referred to our oncology and radiotherapy center by his surgeon for the management of a recurrent tumor of his right subscapularis muscle. Before his assessment in our center, two resections were performed by his surgeon after performing an incision biopsy and magnetic resonance imaging. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging was performed and showed a right axillary nodule size 2.1cm regarding a collection with a residual tumor. We decided to administer imatinib 400mg daily by mouth. Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging evaluation were performed regularly and reported a stable tumor. We reported no adverse side effects to imatinib regarding Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grading. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrences are high during aggressive fibromatosis management. Systemic treatment with imatinib for unresectable or recurrent tumors with positive c-KIT could be the best therapeutic option. In our case report, the patient was stabilized with imatinib for 30 months and he had a very good quality of life."
"Intra-abdominal fibromatosis (IAF) may arise either sporadically or in association with familial adenomatous polyposis. The characteristics of fibromatosis are slow-growth, benign histological features, and aggressive local invasion. Surgery remains a reasonable first treatment option. Here, we report 2 cases of a phenomenon rarely described in published literature, IAF after gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Intra-abdominal masses were found during the routine follow-up period in a 50-year-old man who had received a radical subtotal gastrectomy for early gastric cancer. Two mesenteric masses were detected in the upper abdomen by CT and were excised completely along with segments of the jejunum. Another intra-abdominal mass was found in 60-year-old man who had received a radical total gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer. A 4.2-cm-sized mass was detected in the periumbilical region by follow-up CT and was excised completely along with a segment of the ileum."
"Background/Aims Desmoid tumors (DTs) are rare, locally invasive neoplasms that may affect 10-25% of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients. Our aim was to evaluate incidence and clinical presentation among our patients, the potential impact on FAP outcome and to discuss treatment. Materials and methods Charts from 133 FAP (1977-2013) were reviewed. Patients with DTs were separated to retrieve demographic, clinical and management data. Follow-up was focused on disease evolution causing complications or death. Results 19 (14.3%) DTs were diagnosed, either after previous trauma (16) or during FAP surgery (3). This group comprised 8 men (42.1%) and 11 women (57.9%) with an average age of 32.9 years. Intervals from surgical trauma to DTs ranged from 7 to 60 months. ECMs were detected in 12 (63.1%) patients. DTs were located in the abdominal wall (8), abdominal cavity (8), abdominal wall and cavity (2) and left arm (1). Five patients (26.3%) referred family history of DTs. Patients presented severe complications such as small bowel obstruction (4) and hydronephrosis (2), being directly responsible for death in three patients. Conclusions (1) DTs developed in 14.3% of FAP, mostly after surgical trauma; (2) 30% caused severe morbidity; (3) identification of clinical risk factors may help surgeons to develop screening and therapeutic decisions."
"Desmoid tumours represent aggressive fibroblastic proliferation of the musculoaponeurotic structures commonly from the anterior abdominal wall. These tumours infiltrate locally, recur frequently but do not metastasize. Antecedent trauma, pregnancy and estrogens play a role in the etiopathogenesis of these tumours. In familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) genetic history associated with chromosomal abnormality and familial incidence as in Gardner's syndrome is reported and most of these tumours are intraperitoneal either in the mesentery or pelvis and may be multiple and they carry poor prognosis. Surgery is the most preferred treatment and requires wide excision with 1 cm margin followed by reconstruction of the defect in the anterior abdominal wall either with local musculoaponeurotic layers or with synthetic mesh. In intra-abdominal cases associated with FAP in addition to surgery, hormonal treatment, chemotherapy and Radiotherapy are also advised depending upon the particular condition but usually prognosis is not encouraging. In this article we present our personal experience in the successful treatment of six cases of sporadic desmoids, five in females of child bearing age, and all in the anterior abdominal wall and one extra abdominal in a child aged 13 y in the gluteal region (Case 6). It is very interesting and unique to see two desmoid tumours developing in the same patient (Case2)one in each of the Rectus abdominal muscles (Right & Left)."
"Fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors of the head and neck are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by the proliferation of fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, or both. These tumors may be further subclassified on the basis of their behavior as benign, intermediate with malignant potential, or malignant. There are different types of fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors that can involve the head and neck including desmoid-type fibromatosis, solitary fibrous tumor, myofibroma/myofibromatosis, nodular fasciitis, nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, fibrosarcoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, fibromatosis coli, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, ossifying fibroma, fibrous histiocytoma, nodular fasciitis, fibromyxoma, hyaline fibromatosis and fibrous hamartoma. Although the imaging characteristics of fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors of the head and neck are nonspecific, imaging plays a pivotal role in the noninvasive diagnosis and characterization of these tumors, providing information about the constitution of tumors, their extension and invasion of adjacent structures. Correlation with the clinical history may help limit the differential diagnosis and radiologists should be familiar with the imaging appearance of these tumors to reach an accurate diagnosis."
"Aim of study was to assess the correlation between computed tomography scan (CT) findings and histopathology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were collected on consecutive patients with suspected retroperitoneal sarcoma (RPS) referred to a tertiary sarcoma center. Patients underwent contrast enhanced multi-detector CT scans. Radiological features of lesions were classified according to the presence of a fatty (Group A) mass, or non-fatty (Group B) mass, both subdivided according to homogeneity and intralesional high-contrasted appearance. Radiological classification was compared with histopathological diagnosis. Sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value (PPV, NPV) were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 291 patients, 103/291 (35.4%) masses were classified in Group A and 188/291 (64.6%) in Group B. Diagnosis of mesenchymal tumor was obtained in 231/291 cases (79%) and non-mesenchymal tumor in 60/291 (21%). Sensitivity and specificity of Group A for liposarcoma were 76.7% and 92.0%; PPV and NPV were 86.4% and 85.6%. Sensitivity of Group B for a mesenchymal tumor was 55.4% and specificity was 0%; PPV and NPV were 68.1% and 0%. CONCLUSIONS: None of radiological criteria were sufficient to anticipate a specific diagnosis, with the only exception of well differentiated liposarcoma and angiomyolipoma. In a series of suspected RPS, 21% of the lesions were finally non-mesenchymal tumors."
"The Sterile Alpha Motif Domain-containing 9 (SAMD9) gene has been recently emphasized during the discovery that it is expressed at a lower level in aggressive fibromatosis and some cases of breast and colon cancer, however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we found that SAMD9 is down-regulated in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Furthermore, knockdown of SAMD9 expression is increased the invasion, migration and proliferation in H1299 cells in vitro and overexpression of SAMD9 suppressed proliferation and invasion in A549 cells. Finally, depletion of SAMD9 increases tumor formation in vivo. Our results may provide a strategy for blocking NSCLC tumorigenesis and progression."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a rare but invasive tumor infiltrating widely between fascia and muscle fibers. It has a high tendency to be locally recurrent despite complete resection. Effectiveness of adjuvant treatment for aggressive fibromatosis including radiotherapy, pharmacological agents, hormonal treatments, and chemotherapy have been previously reported. The purpose of this article was to collect and analyze all information regarding the effectiveness and side effects of oral methotrexate in aggressive fibromatosis. METHODS: From 2005 to 2011, eleven patients with aggressive fibromatosis treated with oral methotrexate at our institution were analyzed in this study. Oral methotrexate was administered once per week at 10 mg per week. Authors collected information about effectiveness concerning cases of local recurrence and metastasis. RESULTS: Eleven patients had remission, two patients had local recurrence. Fatal complications or toxicity were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Oral methotrexate given at this dose and schedule was considered as a useful treatment in primary inoperable fibromatosis and recurrent fibromatosis."
"Pseudotumoral soft tissue masses in children and adolescents are a frequent reason for consultation and a diagnostic dilemma. Soft tissue malignancies are relatively uncommon, unlike the large number of benign lesions that may be seen in the superficial tissue and that can be diagnosed with clinical characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study concerns 161 children and adolescents less than 20 years old, referred for a soft tissue mass between 2007 and 2011. It describes their epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and course of care to validate a diagnostic strategy for such masses. RESULTS: Final diagnoses were malignant tumors (44%), benign tumors (32%), and pseudotumoral lesions (24%). Clinical features were similar between these three groups except for age and tumor location, with more benign thoracic masses in younger children. Clinical and radiological association led to an accurate diagnosis for 50% of benign masses and with cytological analysis contribution in 79% of benign tumors and 86% of pseudotumoral lesions. Malignant tumors were suspected in only 39% of cases with radiological exams and in 89% after fine-needle aspiration, an essential additional diagnostic tool. Final diagnoses were formally established through simple standard clinical and radiological evaluation in 19 patients (11.8%; benign tumors, seven patients; malformations, eight patients; post-traumatic lesions, two patients; infection and inflammation, one patient each); ultrasound exam in five patients (3.1%; hemangioendotheliomas, two patients, fascial dehiscence, hemangioma, and vascular malformation, one patient each); MRI in four patients (2.5%; three vascular malformations and one lipoma); CT in two cases (1.2%; vascular malformation and myositis ossificans), and radiological examinations associated with cell aspiration in 15 cases (9.3%; ten benign tumors and five malignant tumors). CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary approach should be requested from oncological, radiological, and pathologic experts to optimize soft tissue mass management as soon as initial investigations start. The authors advise a diagnostic strategy for children with pseudotumoral soft tissue masses."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is a rare monoclonal, fibroblastic proliferation characterised by a variable and often unpredictable clinical course. It may affect nearly all parts of the body including extremities, trunk and abdomen. Considering the variable clinical presentations, anatomic locations and biological behaviours, an individualised treatment approach is required. No established or evidence-based approach for the treatment of this neoplasm is available as of today. Therefore, we propose a consensus treatment algorithm based on a round table meeting bringing together sarcoma experts from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma Group (STBSG) with patient advocates from Sarcoma Patients EuroNet (SPAEN). The aim of the meeting was to develop - for the first time ever - a consensus approach based on professionals' AND patients' expertise. As a fundamental prerequisite, all patients should be discussed in a multidisciplinary setting in centres or professional networks with a specific expertise in the disease."
"Desmoid tumours are benign, myofibroblastic stromal neoplasms common in Gardner's syndrome, which is a subtype of familial adenomatous polyposis characterized by colonic polyps, osteomas, thyroid cancer, epidermoid cysts, fibromas and sebaceous cysts. The primary treatment is surgery, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy, but the local recurrence rate is high, and wide resection can result in debilitating loss of function. We report the case of a 39-year-old man with Gardner's syndrome who had already undergone a total prophylactic colectomy. He developed desmoid tumours localized in the mesenteric root, abdominal wall and dorsal region, which were treated from 2003 through 2013 with several surgical procedures and percutaneous radiofrequency ablation. In 2008 and 2013, RFA was applied under ultrasonographic guidance to two desmoid tumours localized in the dorsal thoracic wall. The outcomes were low-grade pain and one case of superficial skin necrosis, but so far there has been no recurrence of desmoid tumours in these locations. Surgical resection remains the first-line therapy for patients with desmoid tumours, but wide resection may lead to a poor quality of life. Radiofrequency ablation is less invasive and expensive and is a possible therapeutic option for desmoid tumours in patients with Gardner's syndrome."
Mesenteric fibromatosis is an uncommon tumour which is locally aggressive without any metastatic potential and can occur as a sporadic event or in association with familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome. Giant mesenteric fibromatosis is very rare and is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. This is a case report of a rare presentation of deep fibromatosis as a sporadic giant intrabdominal mesenteric tumour in a 29 year old male managed by surgical excision and definitive diagnosis made on the basis of immunohistochemical findings.

"The prognostic value of surgical resection margins in predicting recurrence of desmoid-type fibromatosis remains inconclusive, and appropriate resection margins are not defined. We analyzed whether specific factors related to margin status, including the adequacy of pathologic assessment, affect the prognostic impact of surgical resection margins in a retrospective cohort study. The distance (clearance) and tissue composition of resection margins were recorded for primary desmoid resections with negative margins. The number of positive margins and the linear extent of marginal involvement were recorded for cases with positive margins. The number of tissue sections submitted for histopathologic evaluation of resection margins was also noted. Factors predictive of a positive margin and local recurrence were evaluated by logistic regression and survival analyses. The probability of documenting a positive margin increased with the number of tissue sections submitted for assessment of margin status (odds ratio 1.16; P=0.007). Recurrence-free survival at 10 years for patients with positive (N=52) or negative (N=40) resection margins was 68% and 60%, respectively. Only tumor clearance was predictive of local recurrence. A positive or close (<1 mm) resection margin was an independent prognostic factor for local recurrence in a multivariate Cox regression model accounting for patient age and anatomic site (hazard ratio 9.52; P=0.028). Surgical resection margin status, as currently evaluated and reported, fails to predict recurrence-free survival for desmoid tumors. Instead, positive or close (<1 mm) resection margins are predictive of disease recurrence. In addition, multiple targeted sections are necessary for accurate assessment of surgical resection margins of desmoid-type fibromatosis."
"A 57-year-old woman with a previous history of aesthetic surgery for breast reduction presented with a subcutaneous mass in the right axilla. A CT scan showed a solid mass on the chest wall, and she underwent surgical resection with a diagnosis of aggressive fibromatosis. After a 10-month period of follow-up, a local recurrence occurred, and in accordance with the up-to-date approach, the recurrence has been treated with a conservative approach (medical treatments) with good control of the symptoms and downsizing of the lesion."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a rare mesenchymal neoplasm with local aggressiveness. The incidence of desmoid-type fibromatosis is 2-5/million/year with intra-abdominal fibromatosis, such as that which is reported in this clinical case, occurring only in 12-18% of cases. After having analyzed the pathogenetic hypotheses of desmoid-type fibromatosis, the authors point out that the diagnosis of this disease, especially in the intra-abdominal form, is often late, specifically when highly demolitive interventions are needed or when the limits of radical surgery have been exceeded. In the clinical case reported, the tumor was infiltrating both ileus and sigma. The authors consider the differential diagnosis of desmoid-type fibromatosis, especially with GISTs, with regard to both the radiological preoperative diagnostic and histological studies on the surgical specimen. Radical surgical excision is not always, for this disease, a sign of healing; in fact, even when the resection margins are negative, the incidence of recurrence is between 13 and 68%. The average time of recurrence is between 15 and 24 months; in this case report, the patient, who has not been subjected to complementary therapies, is tumor-free for over 30 months since surgery; his prognosis may be satisfactory if we consider the negativity of resection margins, which in any case remains the most important prognostic factor."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) comprises tumors with a varying biological behavior. Genetic tumor characteristics may be predictive of recurrence; hence, the prognostic value of three specific mutations on the CTNNB1 gene was evaluated in relation to known clinicopathologic risk factors in patients with primary, sporadic AF. METHODS: In a multi-institutional retrospective cohort study of patients with primary extra-abdominal and abdominal wall AF who underwent surgical treatment, the original pathology specimens were reviewed for the presence of a T41A, S45F, and 45P mutations on the CTNNB1 gene. For these mutations, the risk of recurrence was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression was performed to calculate hazard ratios. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were analyzed. During a median follow-up of 41 months, 17 recurrences were detected; the cumulative 5-year recurrence rate was 22.8 %. A specific CTNNB1 mutation was found in 76 patients, with the majority of patients having a T41A mutation (n = 49). CTNNB1 mutations were associated with the risk of recurrence: the presence of a S45F mutation was associated with a 5-year cumulative risk of recurrence of 63.8 % (P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that young age and S45F mutation were independent risk factors (P = 0.011 and P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of specific CTNNB1 mutations was predictive for recurrence in patients after surgical treatment for primary, sporadic extra-abdominal and abdominal AF. A S45F mutation increased the risk of recurrence significantly."
"A phase I trial of PF-03084014, an oral reversible gamma-secretase inhibitor, in solid tumor malignancies shows drug tolerability in patients. Evidence of Notch pathway inhibition was demonstrated in peripheral blood. A surprisingly high rate of response was seen in desmoid tumors, a rare but sometimes locally aggressive sarcoma."
"Desmoid tumors are defined as a rare fibroblastic proliferative disease and may occur in any musculoaponeurotic or fascial tissue . CASE REPORT: A 54-year-old man with FAP referred to our institution presenting fever and abdominal pain. Four years before a prophylactic colectomy with ileal-rectal anastomosis was done. Three years later a wide intraabdominal mass with desmoid characteristics was detected. In spite of therapy with tamoxifene the RM control showed an increase of mass dimension. Few days later the patient arrived in our istitute with fever and abdominal pain. Medical therapy didn't improve clinical symptoms and the patient underwent surgery. DISCUSSION: Desmoid tumors are benign tumors, but not a benign disease. Most of these tumors occur sporadically, but about 5% arise in association with familial adenomatous polyposis. Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors remain asymptomatic until their growth and infiltration causes visceral compression. They can cause serious complications and treatment is often unsuccessful. Aggressive fibromatosis treatment should be evaluated and managed by a multidisciplinary team with expertise and experience in sarcoma, prior to initiation of therapy. In FAP, surgery has been recommended for abdominal wall tumors but there are only few indications for intra-abdominal disease like pain, bowel obstruction and desmoids perforation."
"The proband was a 32-year-old man with sparse type of familial adenomatous polyposis with fundic gland and duodenal polyps and congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium without osteoma, dental abnormalities and desmoid tumors. Direct DNA sequencing did not detect germline mutations in any APC exon. However, using the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification method, we detected germline deletions of all APC exons. Using dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization, we identified germline deletion of locus 5q22.1-22.2 that includes APC. Analysis of colorectal tumors identified somatic APC mutations in the cluster region in all polyps, but no loss of heterozygosity was detected in any polyp."
"Retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcomas (RPS) are rare tumors that include several well-defined histologic subtypes. Although surgery is the mainstay of curative therapy, no universally accepted recommendations concerning the best management have been developed to date. Optimization of the initial approach is critical for maximizing patient outcomes. METHODS: An RPS Trans-Atlantic Working Group was established in 2013. The primary aim was to evaluate the current evidence critically and to develop a consensus document on the approach to this difficult disease. The outcome applies to primary RPS that is nonvisceral in origin. The evaluation included sarcomas of major veins (inferior vena cava, renal vein, ovarian/testicular vein), undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma of the psoas, and ureteric leiomyosarcoma (LMS). It excluded desmoid, lipoma and angiomyolipoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, visceral sarcomas such as those arising from the gut or its mesentery, uterine LMS, prostatic sarcoma, paratesticular/spermatic cord sarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, alveolar/embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, primitive peripheral neuro-ectodermal tumor, sarcoma arising from teratoma, carcinosarcoma, sarcomatoid carcinoma, clear cell sarcoma, radiation-induced sarcoma, paraganglioma, and malignant pheochromocytoma. RESULTS: Management of RPS was evaluated from diagnosis to follow-up, and a level of evidence was attributed to each statement. This rare and complex malignancy is best managed by an experienced multidisciplinary team in a specialized referral center. The best chance of cure is at the time of primary presentation, and an individualized management plan should be made based on the statements included in this article. CONCLUSIONS: International collaboration is critical for adding to the current knowledge. A prospective registry will be set up."
"mesenteric, parietal or mixed. 79 FAP patients [45 females (56 %); mean age 33.3 +/- 12.5] presented 149 DT and were included; 16(20 %) had a DT diagnosed during or before first abdominal surgery and 47 (59 %) had isolated mesenteric DT. 11 patients had only surgical treatment, 17 only medical treatments, 31 had combined treatment and 20 had no treatment with spontaneous DT regression or stabilization. Overall, 80 treatment lines were administered to patients with a progression free or regression rate of 43 % (34/80). Response rates were: chemotherapy 77 % (10/13); Sulindac + tamoxifen 50 % (6/12); Tamoxifen 40 % (6/15); Imatinib 36 % (4/11); Sulindac 28 % (8/29). Among the 42 surgical procedures, an R0 resection was performed in 26 (62 %) allowing the absence of recurrence for 54 %. After a median follow-up of 81 months, 8 patients died of their DT and 6 died of other cause. Overall and DT-specific survival at 20 years were 52 and 79 %, respectively. Chemotherapy was the most efficient treatment. For intra-abdominal DT, we consider it as a first choice treatment and reserve surgery when it is impossible or when DT are life threatening."

"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a rare disease caused by a mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC). CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 32-year-old woman, with abdominal pain and increased abdominal perimeter, as well as melena and weight loss. She had a tumor of 12 cm in diameter in the right iliac fossa. After the administration of contrast media we found the abdominal tumor compatible with sarcoma versus desmoid tumor. We performed a colonoscopy and we found colorectal polyps. The biopsy reported tubulovillous adenomas. A panendoscopy showed polyps in fundus and body of stomach; the state of the duodenum was normal. Tumor resection was performed with abdominal wall reconstruction with mesh and restorative proctocolectomy with ileoanal reservoir and a temporary ileostomy. The histopathology report demonstrated an abdominal wall desmoid tumor and identified 152 tubulovillous polyps which affected all the portions of colon and rectum. CONCLUSIONS: FAP is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a mutation in the APC gene which results in the development of multiple colorectal polyps. Described in 1991 the APC gene is located at chromosome region 5q21. Without prophylactic surgery, virtually all patients develop colorectal cancer in the third decade of life. Desmoid tumors and duodenal polyps are now the leading cause of death in patients with FAP."
"Aggressive fibromatoses (desmoid tumours) may be locally aggressive, but do not metastasize. Although a conservative approach is advocated for most patients, pain and functional impairment are indications for active treatment. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and melphalan-based isolated limb perfusion (TM-ILP) is a limb-saving treatment modality for soft tissue tumours. This study reports the results of TM-ILP treatment in patients with aggressive fibromatosis. METHODS: Institutional databases of three European centres were searched. All patients who received TM-ILP treatment for aggressive fibromatosis between 1990 and 2012 were included. Before therapy, the patients were discussed at multidisciplinary tumour board meetings. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients received 28 TM-ILP treatments. The median age of patients was 28 (i.q.r. 19-34) years and median hospital stay was 8 (7-12) days. Median follow-up was 84 (34-114) months. A complete response was achieved after two TM-ILP treatments, and a partial response after 17 treatments in 16 patients. Stable disease was reported after eight treatments in seven patients, including a patient with stable disease after the first treatment and progression after the second TM-ILP. Toxicity was modest after most treatments; Wieberdink grade IV (extensive epidermolysis, and threatening or manifest compartment syndrome) was seen after two TM-ILP treatments. Systemic leakage was reported after one treatment, but did not lead to systemic toxicity. Functional outcome was good; 16 patients had no physical limitations, and six patients had some limitations but did not need medical aids. Amputation was prevented in all but three patients. CONCLUSION: TNF-alpha-based ILP is effective in patients with aggressive fibromatosis."
"Desmoid tumors (DTs) are rare, benign soft-tissue tumors that have the potential for local invasion, but not for metastasis. The tumors are commonly characterized by a palpable mass, but present a variable and unpredictable clinical course. The current study presents the case of a giant mediastinal DT exhibiting lung involvement. A 50-year-old female was referred to the West China Hospital (Chengdu, Sichuan, China) due to a recurrent DT that was identified one year following radical surgery. The patient subsequently received radiation therapy. The DT arose from the mediastinum, unlike the usual presentation, and recurrence presented as extensive invasion into the lung tissue, almost being misdiagnosed as lung cancer with brain metastasis. Tumor recurrence was diagnosed through contrast-enhanced computed tomography and histological examination of the tumor. A routine follow-up revealed no further tumor progression at 9 months post-admission. Taking into account the unpredictable treatment complications, recurrent DTs can be managed simply and efficiently. A 'wait-and-see' policy could be a viable therapeutic option for this disease."
" 65-year-old female with an eventration of the right diaphragm underwent a sternal resection and reconstruction for a large desmoid tumor. After continuous mechanical ventilation for 3 months, she was still under noninvasive positive pressure ventilation( NPPV) for 24 hours a day. Plication of the right hemidiaphragm was performed and the patient was successfully weaned from NPPV. Case 2:A 41-year-old female with myasthenia gravis underwent a surgery for a recurrent thymoma. Left phrenicotomy was necessary to achieve a complete resection of the tumor. Plication of the left diaphragm was performed during the tumor resection to prevent possible respiratory complications. Postoperative course was uneventful, and her vital capacity was well maintained."
"In patients with a tumour affecting the distal ulna it is difficult to preserve the function of the wrist following extensive local resection. We report the outcome of 12 patients (nine female, three male) who underwent excision of the distal ulna without local soft-tissue reconstruction. In six patients, an aggressive benign tumour was present and six had a malignant tumour. At a mean follow-up of 64 months (15 to 132) the mean Musculoskeletal Tumour score was 64% (40% to 93%) and the mean DASH score was 35 (10 to 80). The radiological appearances were satisfactory in most patients. Local recurrence occurred in one patient with benign disease and two with malignant disease. The functional outcome was thus satisfactory at a mean follow-up in excess of five years, with a relatively low rate of complications. The authors conclude that complex reconstructive soft-tissue procedures may not be needed in these patients."
"Desmoid fibromatosis is a benign fibroblastic neoplasm with high recurrence rates predominantly observed in pediatric and adolescent patients. The use of wide resection margins has been discussed controversially in literature. In addition, data on non-surgical treatment is limited as phase III studies are still missing. Nineteen patients under the age of 18 years were identified. Tumor location, surgical treatment for primary or recurrent tumors, resection margins, medical neo-/adjuvant treatment, time to recurrence as well as immunohistochemical markers (estrogen receptor, ER alpha and beta, progesterone and androgen receptors, somatostatin, Ki-67, c-kit, platelet-derived growth factor receptors, PDGFRs, alpha and beta, beta-catenin) were evaluated. The mean age at diagnosis was 6.6 years, with a mean follow-up of 114 months. Recurrences were detected in four out of nineteen patients. Surprisingly, the recurrence rate was not influenced by type of resection used (R0, R1/2). All samples were tested negative for ER alpha, somatostatin, and progesterone receptor. In contrast, a majority of tumors showed positive results for PDGFR alpha and beta and beta-catenin. No correlation between positive immunohistochemical markers and tumor recurrences was detectable. In conclusion, recurrence rates are not depending on resection type and immunohistochemical markers seem to behave differently in children and adolescents in contrast to adult patients."
"This report describes an 18-year-old woman presenting with abdominal distension, left flank pain, and hypertension. She had a huge abdominal mass, diagnosed as a mesenteric desmoid-type fibromatosis, causing compression of the left external iliac vessels and ureter, as well as elevated renin concentration and hypertension. After surgical removal of the mass, all signs improved including hypertension."
"Desmoid type fibromatosis is an uncommon benign disease entity of which its etiology is currently unknown. It constitutes 0.3% of all solid neoplasms, but it is rarely seen in the breast and even more scarcely reported to develop in association with breast implant. We present ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging findings of a 29-year-old female patient with fibromatosis after breast implant surgery. Knowledge of imaging findings of breast fibromatosis associated with implant will be helpful for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management."
"To present a case of recurrent vulvar fibromatosis in an adolescent, discuss the specific difficulties of treating adolescents, and review the literature on available treatment. METHODS: We present a case of recurrent vulvar fibromatosis in a 14-year-old girl, requiring several treatment modalities, including multiple surgeries, radiation therapy, and multiagent chemotherapy. We then discuss management strategies for these tumor types, and specifically examine how tumor location may impact their treatment. RESULTS: Vulvar desmoids are extremely uncommon and they can be disfiguring and cause significant discomfort for women. Initial management of these tumors is surgical excision, yet failed surgery is often followed by other treatment modalities, including radiation, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy. This case clearly highlights the difficulties in managing these rare tumors, particularly in the adolescent population. CONCLUSIONS: Desmoid tumors are nonmalignant, locally aggressive neoplasms most common in the 15 to 60 years age group. They are associated with high estrogen states, prior surgical trauma, and Gardner syndrome. Most commonly, desmoid tumors present in the abdominal wall, shoulder, neck, and chest, but can occur anywhere in the body. Given their rarity and lack of definitive therapy, vulvar desmoid tumors can be exceedingly difficult to treat, and are best managed with an interdisciplinary approach."
"To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for continuous oral administration of the gamma-secretase inhibitor PF-03084014, determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D), and evaluate safety and preliminary activity in patients with advanced solid tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This open-label, phase I study consisted of a dose-finding portion based on a 3+3 design, followed by an expansion cohort. PF-03084014 was administered orally, twice daily (BID) for 21 continuous days. Tested doses ranged from 20 to 330 mg BID. In the expansion cohort, patients were to receive the estimated MTD or a lower dose of PF-03084014. RESULTS: A total of 64 patients received treatment. The MTD was estimated to be 220 mg BID. The RP2D was determined to be 150 mg BID, based on the better safety profile versus the 220-mg BID dose, given comparable NOTCH-related target inhibition. The most common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, hypophosphatemia, vomiting, rash, and decreased appetite, which were generally mild to moderate in severity. One patient with advanced thyroid cancer had a complete response, and five of seven response-evaluable patients with desmoid tumor achieved a partial response (71.4% objective response rate). Tumor responses were mostly durable, ranging from 1.74+ to 24+ months. PF-03084014 demonstrated a generally dose-dependent pharmacokinetic profile at doses ranging from 20 to 330 mg BID. Consistent downmodulation of NOTCH-related HES4 gene expression was observed in peripheral blood from all evaluable patients. CONCLUSION: Further development of PF-03084014 for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors is warranted and currently under evaluation."
"Male, 69. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Mesenteric desmoid tumor. SYMPTOMS: -. MEDICATION: -. CLINICAL PROCEDURE: -. OBJECTIVE: Rare disease. BACKGROUND: Intra-abdominal fibromatosis is a benign rare tumor of fibrous origin with a significant potential for local invasion and no ability to metastasize, but it can recur. The etiology of desmoid tumors is unknown. It is often associated with conditions such as familial adenomatous polyposis and Gardner syndrome. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 69-year-old man who presented to our hospital with an acute pulmonary embolism. The patient had a past history of colic surgery for a polyp with a high-grade dysplasia. Pulmonary angiography showed partial occlusion of the right superior lobe artery and partial occlusion of the middle lobe artery. The patient was given thrombolytic therapy. Abdominal computerized tomography revealed a mesenterial giant mass with compression of the inferior vena cava (IVC). A biopsy of the mass, confirming aggressive fibromatosis. A laparotomy was performed, which revealed a massive growth occupying the abdomen and attached to the previous ileocolic anastomosis. One day after surgery, his condition deteriorated. CONCLUSIONS: This report underlines the potential of imaging investigations of abdomen and vena cava if pulmonary embolism is suspected, especially when there is no evidence of peripheral venous thrombosis or other predisposing factors. Unfortunately, data on the surgical management of desmoid tumor is scarce. Therefore, the standard of treatment is a surgical resection for resectable tumors."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) is a rare fibroblastic proliferative disease with a locally aggressive behavior and no distant metastasis, characterized by driver mutations in CTNNB1 or the APC gene. When progressive and/or symptomatic AF is not amenable to local management, a variety of medical treatments may be efficient, including imatinib mesylate. The phase II ""Desminib trial"" included 40 patients with AF to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of imatinib resulting in a 65% tumor control rate at 1 year. We investigated a potential predictive value of KIT exon 10 M541L variant (KITL541) on this prospective series. METHODS: DNA was extracted in sufficient quantity from 33 patients included in the Desminib trial. The detection of KITL541 was performed by Competitive Allele-Specific Taqman(R) PCR technology. Chi-2 analyses were performed to search for a correlation between KIT status and tumor response. Progression free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared by log-rank test after Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: In 6 out of 33 cases (18%), the technique failed to determine the mutational status; 5 patients (19%) harboured KITL541 and 22 patients (81%) were classified as KIT wild type. Compared with total cohort, KITL541 frequency did not distinguish between different clinical characteristics. In the KITL541 and the KITWT subgroups, the tumor control rate at 1 year was 100% and 68%, respectively (p = 0.316). The median PFS of patients harboring KITL541 or not is 29.9 and 24.5 months, respectively (p = 0.616), and the median OS is not reached, in any of the groups. CONCLUSION: Our results do not support a predictive effect of KITL541 on the efficacy of imatinib for patients with AF."
"The objective of this study was to examine the clincopathologic characteristics and outcomes of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients with and without desmoid tumors (DTs), including the risk factors for progression of FAP-related DTs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records and database of all patients with FAP who were treated between January 1993 and December 2011. RESULTS: Of 75 FAP patients, 18 (24%) were FAP with DTs. Seventeen of these had intra-abdominal DTs and one had intra- and extra-abdominal DTs. We divided the patients into two groups according to type of resection; the R0 or R1 resection group, referred to as the curative resection group (eight patients), and the R2 resection/palliative operation/medical treatment group, referred to as the palliative resection group (10 patients). Two patients in the curative resection group and two patients in the palliative group had progressed to tumor growth by the follow-up (p=0.800). In univariate analysis, DT diagnosis before or simultaneously with FAP diagnosis (DTs unrelated to surgical trauma) was a significant risk factor for tumor progression at final follow-up. CONCLUSION: A multidisciplinary approach to DT treatment is needed, including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, anti-estrogens, cytotoxic agents, and surgery. However, the role of surgery in resectable and complicated tumors may be limited. DT unrelated to surgical trauma has a relatively poor prognosis."
"Mesenchymal tumors are thought to constitute only 1% of primary gastrointestinal malignancies. Both gastrointestinal stromal tumor and desmoid tumor are rare. The case of a 56-year-old male with a desmoid tumor 1 year after surgical removal of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor near the ligament of Treitz is described. Although he received adjuvant therapy of imatinib mesylate for 1 year after the surgery, a small nodule was found 1 year and 3 months after the surgery. The nodule was considered to be a recurrent tumor of gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and a wedge resection of the duodenum including the tumor was done. Histopathological examination by immunohistochemical staining revealed that it was a desmoid tumor. It would be useful to be aware of the possibility of desmoid tumor after removal of gastrointestinal stromal tumor. To accumulate further information on these rare diseases, a central database that includes rare diseases will be necessary."
"Peritoneal disease can be caused by a wide spectrum of pathologies. While peritoneal disease is usually caused by primary or secondary malignancies, benign diseases can occur and mimic malignancies. This article begins with an overview of peritoneal embryology and anatomy followed by a detailed description of the multimodality imaging appearance of peritoneal diseases. Common diseases include peritoneal carcinomatosis, pseudomyxoma peritonei, lymphomatosis, sarcomatosis, and tuberculous peritonitis. The uncommon diseases which cause peritoneal disease include desmoid fibromatosis, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, malignant mesothelioma, well-differentiated mesothelioma, multicystic mesothelioma, papillary serous carcinoma, leiomyomatosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, inflammatory pseudotumor and amyloidosis. This manuscript will help the radiologist become familiar with the different peritoneal spaces, pathways of spread, multimodality imaging appearance and differential diagnoses of peritoneal diseases in order to report the essential information for surgeons and oncologists to plan treatment."

"Pregnancy has been reported as a risk factor for promoting growth and progression of desmoid-type fibromatosis because of the presumed role of estrogens in stimulating desmoid growth. In this study, the clinical outcomes of females who were pregnant 5 years or less before resection of desmoid tumor or who became pregnant after resection were compared to nulliparous females or females who were pregnant more than 5 years before resection. METHODS: Obstetric histories of desmoid tumor patients were abstracted from medical records. Patients were grouped by pregnancy status as either: pregnancy-associated (pregnant up to 5 years before primary desmoid tumor resection or pregnant after resection) or not pregnancy-associated (nulliparous or pregnant more than 5 years before resection of desmoid tumor). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate pregnancy status as a predictor of desmoid tumor recurrence. RESULTS: There were 15 females who had pregnancy-associated desmoids (33%) and 31 females who had non-pregnancy-associated desmoids (67%). There were no differences in clinicopathologic features or recurrence-free survival between females of different pregnancy status in univariate or multivariate survival analyses. CONCLUSION: Recurrence-free survival rates among women recently pregnant before or pregnant after resection of desmoid tumor and nulliparous women or those with a remote history of pregnancy are comparable after adjusting for patient age, anatomic location, and completeness of surgical resection. Subsequent pregnancy should not be discouraged for reproductive-aged women after resection of desmoid-type fibromatosis."
"Calcifying aponeurotic fibroma (CAF) is a rare, locally aggressive fibroblastic lesion that occurs predominantly in the distal extremities of children and adolescents. In the present study, a case of pathologically proven CAF arising in the right little finger of a 69-year-old woman is presented. Physical examination revealed a firm, immobile, non-tender mass. Plain radiographs showed a faintly calcified soft tissue mass without bone involvement and computed tomography scans clearly demonstrated the presence of the lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the lesion exhibited low to intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and heterogeneous high signal intensity with small foci of low signal intensity on T2-weighted spectral presaturation with inversion recovery images. Contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted images demonstrated intense heterogeneous enhancement throughout the mass. The patient underwent an excisional biopsy. Histologically, the tumor showed a biphasic pattern, composed of a moderately cellular fibromatosis-like component and irregular calcified areas with polygonal epithelioid cells. There has been no evidence of local recurrence four months following surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this case report describes the oldest patient with this condition."
"Desmoid tumours are uncommon non-malignant tumours that show a locally aggressive growth pattern and a high local recurrence rate after surgery. Approximately 10% of the desmoid tumours are associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Variable natural history of the disease challenges treatment decision-making in the absence of prospective, randomised data. Association of this rare tumour to GIST is speculated and the tumorigenesis may share common steps. This study reviews given treatment and reports prognostic factors for local control and concurrent neoplasms in patients evaluated by a single soft tissue tumour group. Patients referred to the soft tissue tumour group at Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH) for a desmoid tumour (primary or recurred) during 1987-2007 and receiving surgical treatment with or without adjuvant treatment were included in this retrospective review. All locations and also patients with a FAP-associated tumour were included. Extra-abdominal location showed lower local control despite the fact that 27% of patients also received radiation therapy. One amputation was performed. Female sex and location in the rectus abdominis muscle predicted improved local control in multivariate analysis. In this review, the occurrence (14%) of concurrent neoplasms was higher than expected with unusual tumour types noted including two GISTs. In those patients in whom surgical treatment is chosen, adjuvant radiation therapy should also be considered in order to decrease morbidity from aggressive surgery aiming at R0 resection. Further studies are suggested to illuminate the biological association between the desmoid tumour and other neoplasms."
"the first in a 13 year old female involving the mandibular body in the region of teeth #s 27-#28, the second in a 57 year old female with a lesion apical to tooth #30, and the third in a 20-year-old female involving the left posterior mandible. Clinical, histologic, immunohistochemical (IHC) and radiographic features of this rare neoplasm are discussed. The challenges encountered in establishing an accurate diagnosis due to significant microscopic overlap with other spindle cell lesions are also detailed. Additionally, the findings of IHC stains including vimentin, smooth muscle actin, S-100 protein, beta-catenin, HHF-35 and proliferation marker, Ki-67 on 3 cases are reported. The potential for misdiagnosis is high, especially in early lesions, since immunohistochemistry has been reported in literature to be inconsistent when differentiating DFs from other spindle cell lesions. A comparative review of DF and similar entities in the jaws with current considerations in treatment and prognosis is presented."
"Fibromatous soft tissue lesions, namely desmoid-type fibromatosis and Gardner fibroma, may occur sporadically or as a result of inherited predisposition (as part of familial adenomatous polyposis, FAP). Whereas desmoid-type fibromatosis often present beta-catenin overexpression (by activating CTNNB1 somatic variants or APC biallelic inactivation), the pathogenetic mechanisms in Gardner fibroma are unknown. We characterized in detail Gardner fibromas diagnosed in two infants to evaluate their role as sentinel lesions of previously unrecognized FAP. In the first infant we found a 5q deletion including APC in the tumor and the novel APC variant c.4687dup in constitutional DNA. In the second infant we found the c.5826_5829del and c.1678A>T APC variants in constitutional and tumor DNA, respectively. None of the constitutional APC variants occurred de novo and both tumors showed nuclear staining for beta-catenin and no CTNNB1 variants. We present the first comprehensive characterization of the pathogenetic mechanisms of Gardner fibroma, which may be a sentinel lesion of previously unrecognized FAP families."
"Although Gardner fibroma is a precursor lesion of desmoid tumor, the prevalence and prognostic importance of Gardner fibroma associated with desmoid tumors has not been systematically studied in adults. From 129 patients with desmoid-type fibromatosis, 170 specimens were re-examined for the presence of an associated Gardner fibroma. Clinicopathologic features of Gardner fibroma-associated desmoid-type fibromatosis were compared to desmoid tumors without associated Gardner fibroma. Recurrence-free survival was compared using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression to account for known confounding factors. Of 104 evaluable primary desmoid tumor resections, 25 (24%) had an associated Gardner fibroma. When previous incisional biopsies and resection specimens of locally recurrent desmoid tumors were also examined, the overall prevalence of associated Gardner fibroma was 37%. Desmoid tumors arising in high risk anatomic sites (extremities or deep soft tissues of the back and chest wall) were more often associated with Gardner fibroma than tumors at other sites. Median recurrence-free survival for patients with Gardner fibroma-associated desmoid-type fibromatosis was 3.2 years, whereas median survival for patients without associated Gardner fibroma was >25 years (hazard ratio 2.8; P = 0.001). Although the presence of Gardner fibroma had no impact on the recurrence rate of desmoid tumors arising at high risk anatomic sites, associated Gardner fibroma increased the risk of recurrence 4-fold for desmoid tumors at low risk anatomic sites. Associated Gardner fibroma is under-recognized in desmoid-type fibromatosis and increases the risk of local recurrence for a subgroup of patients."
"The medical records of 16 patients (9 female and 7 male; age range, 5-66 years) with 24 lesions that had a histologic diagnosis of desmoid tumors were reviewed at our institution. Six cases were extra-abdominal, 4 intra-abdominal, and 6 in the abdominal wall. Lesions ranged from 1.5 to 18.0 cm in diameter (mean, 6.8 cm). All lesions were solid masses, which appeared hypoechoic, isoechoic, or hyperechoic with homogeneous or heterogeneous echogenicity. Posterior acoustic enhancement was seen in 18 lesions. No lesions showed central necrosis. Most lesions had substantial flow and high resistive index values (>0.70). Sonography can show a desmoid tumor's site, size, contour, margin, echogenicity, homogeneity, vascularity, and resistive index value in detail."
"To determine the outcomes of surgical excision with or without adjuvant treatment in the management of desmoid tumors of the upper extremity. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 52 patients with a histologically confirmed desmoid tumor in the upper extremity that was managed surgically. All patients presented between 1970 and 2011 and had a minimum 2-year follow-up. RESULTS: There were 25 males and 27 females with an average age of 37 +/- 17 years. The most common location was the shoulder (n = 27). The most common symptom was a painful mass (n = 30). Average tumor size was 189 +/- 371 cm(3). Negative margins (wide or marginal resection) were achieved in 43 patients. The 5-year disease-free interval was 57%. Patients with recurrence were younger than those without (31 vs 43 y). Postoperative radiotherapy increased the time to recurrence (2.6 vs 1.6 y) but ultimate disease-free interval at 5 years was similar in patients who did and did not receive radiotherapy. Compared with the preoperative evaluation, there was a significant reduction in patients reporting moderate or severe pain postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Desmoid tumors are locally aggressive fibrous tumors. Recurrence after surgical excision of a desmoid tumor in the upper extremity is common, especially in younger patients. Adjuvant radiation therapy tended to increase time to recurrence but not rate of recurrence. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV."
"We are reporting the first documented case of an abdominal desmoid tumor presenting primarily after liver transplantation. This tumor, well described in the literature as occurring both in conjunction with familial adenomatous polyposis as well as in the post-surgical patient, has never been noted after solid organ transplantation and was therefore not included in our differential upon presentation. Definitive diagnosis required the patient to undergo surgical excision and immunochemical staining of the mass for confirmation. A review of the literature showed no primary tumors after transplantation. In a population of patients who received a small bowel transplant after they developed short gut post radical resection of aggressive fibromatosis, only rare recurrences were seen. No connection of tumor development with immunosuppression or need to decrease immunosuppressant treatment has been demonstrated in these patients. Our case and the literature show the risk of this tumor presenting in the post-transplantation patient and the need for a high index of suspicion in patients who present with a complex mass after transplantation to prevent progression of the disease beyond a resectable lesion. Results of a thorough search of the literature are detailed and the medical and surgical management of both resectable and unresectable lesions is reviewed."
"Desmoid fibromatosis is a benign yet locally aggressive tumor with a tendency to recur. It causes considerable morbidity particularly when it arises in a small area in the head and neck region. This tumor is extremely rare in the submandibular region. We report a case of desmoid tumor in the submandibular region in a 32-year-old male who presented with right submandibular swelling postextraction of right lower wisdom tooth. Excision biopsy was carried out initially following inconclusive fine needle aspiration and discussion at multidisciplinary meeting. The tumor recurred 4 months following initial excisional biopsy necessitating a more radical secondary approach involving segmental mandibulectomy. Intraoperatively we also noted that the tumor was originating from the site of previous wisdom tooth extraction, raising the question of surgical trauma as precursor of desmoid tumor. We achieved a negative resection margin and a complete remission for 24 months."
"There is increasing evidence that Wilms' tumor transcription factor-1 (WT1) is expressed in the cytoplasm of neoplastic cells from different benign and malignant tumors. Only a few studies on WT1 cytoplasmic immunolocalization are available in pediatric tumors. The aim of the present study was to investigate immunohistochemically the expression and distribution of WT1 in a large series of soft tissue fibroblastic/myofibroblastic lesions occurring in children and adolescents. Notably WT1 was not expressed in nodular fasciitis and desmoid-type (adult) fibromatosis, while it stained diffusely and strongly in several infantile-type fibromatoses, such as fibrous hamartoma of infancy, myofibroma/myofibromatosis, and lipofibromatosis. Interestingly, WT1 cytoplasmic expression was also found in all cases (10/10) of infantile fibrosarcomas examined. The present study shows that a diffuse WT1 cytoplasmic expression is of complementary diagnostic value to conventional myofibroblastic markers (alpha-smooth muscle actin; desmin) in confirming diagnosis of young-type fibromatoses or infantile fibrosarcoma and in ruling out both desmoid-type fibromatoses and nodular fasciitis. WT1 cytoplasmic expression in infantile fibrosarcoma is a novel finding which could be exploitable as an immunomarker for this tumor. Although highly sensitive, WT1 cytoplasmic immunostaining is not specific for infantile fibrosarcoma, and thus it should be evaluated in the context of a wide immunohistochemical panel when pathologists are dealing with spindle cell lesions of soft tissues in children and adolescents. Accordingly we recommend that a correct diagnosis of fibroblastic/myofibroblastic soft tissue lesion in pediatric patients is usually achieved on the basis of a careful correlation of morphological and immunohistochemical findings in the appropriate clinical context. The different cellular localization of WT1, namely nuclear, cytoplasmic or nucleo-cytoplasmic, in different benign and malignant tumors supports the hypothesis that this transcription factor plays a complex role in tumorigenesis, likely as a chameleon protein functioning as either a tumor suppressor gene or an oncogene, depending on cellular context."
"Fibromatosis is a fibroblastic lesion composed of uniform fibroblasts and collagen with an infiltrative growth pattern but lacking malignant cytological features. It is a rare entity and is even more unusual when found in the breast. Multicentricity in fibromatosis has been reported in 10% cases. Multicentricity in breast cancer has been defined as the presence of two or more tumor foci within different quadrants of the same breast. Considering this definition of multicentricity for fibromatosis, we herein report a case of recurrent multicentric aggressive mammary fibromatosis and its cytological features with review of literature because of limited literature of (FNAC) in mammary fibromatosis."
"Fibromatosis of the breast is a rare condition that predominantly affects middle-aged women. It is locally aggressive, and exhibits a high incidence of local recurrence. The clinical presentation and radiological appearance are highly suspicious for carcinoma. Definitive diagnosis is made by diagnostic open biopsy. The aim of this review is to illustrate the main radiological and histopathological characteristics of this rare disease to increase awareness of this entity and discuss the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in its management."
"00), which has not been reported by others, on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded whole sections and tissue microarray slides. Only nuclear staining of STAT6 was considered positive. Distribution of staining was scored as: 0 (no staining), 1+ (1-25%), 2+ (26-50%), 3+ (>50%). Intensity was scored as weak, moderate or strong. Nuclear STAT6 staining was present in all SFT cases tested (54/54, sensitivity 100%), regardless of histology, anatomical site or CD34 status. The majority of cases showed 3+ and strong staining. All tested cases of cellular angiofibroma (0/9), myofibroblastoma (0/10), spindle cell lipoma (0/10), benign fibrous histiocytoma (0/13), dermatofibrosarcoma protruberans (0/9), low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (0/7), schwannoma (0/8), desmoid-type fibromatosis (0/8), monophasic synovial sarcoma (0/11), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (0/7), and mesenchymal chondrosarcoma (0/7) were negative for STAT6 (specificity 100%). Our study further supports the utility of STAT6 immunohistochemistry as an adjunct in the diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumour."
"The biologic heterogeneity of soft tissue sarcomas (STS), even within histological subtypes, complicates treatment. In earlier studies, gene expression patterns that distinguish two subsets of clear cell renal carcinoma (RCC), serous ovarian carcinoma (OVCA), and aggressive fibromatosis (AF) were used to separate 73 STS into two or four groups with different probabilities of developing metastatic disease (PrMet). This study was designed to confirm our earlier observations in a larger independent data set. METHODS: We utilized these gene sets, hierarchical clustering (HC), and Kaplan-Meier analysis, to examine 309 STS, using Affymetrix chip expression profiling. RESULTS: HC using the combined AF-, RCC-, and OVCA-gene sets identified subsets of the STS samples. Analysis revealed differences in PrMet between the clusters defined by the first branch point of the clustering dendrogram (p = 0.048), and also among the four different clusters defined by the second branch points (p < 0.0001). Analysis also revealed differences in PrMet between the leiomyosarcomas (LMS), dedifferentiated liposarcomas (LipoD), and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas (UPS) (p = 0.0004). HC of both the LipoD and UPS sample sets divided the samples into two groups with different PrMet (p = 0.0128, and 0.0002, respectively). HC of the UPS samples also showed four groups with different PrMet (p = 0.0007). HC found no subgroups of the LMS samples. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm our earlier studies, and suggest that this approach may allow the identification of more than two subsets of STS, each with distinct clinical behavior, and may be useful to stratify STS in clinical trials and in patient management."
"Fibromatosis is the non-malignant proliferation of fibroblasts that aggressively invade adjacent tissues. It is composed of well-differentiated cells separated by considerable collagen and/or reticulin. The cause of this abundant growth is unknown, but many suspect hormonal or traumatic influences. When fibromatosis develops in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) or adjoining tissues, its aggressive growth can compress the trachea and cause death. The management is difficult as it is perplexing to comprehend. Resection is the treatment of choice. The following case report presents a rare case of fibromatosis involving TMJ and its uneventful successful management."
"Malignant fibrohistiocytic tumors are a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal neoplasms that may occur in the skin and subcutaneous tissues. DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis of these tumors may be difficult, as they are rare, and a wide morphological diversity of types and subtypes has been described. In this update, relevant aspects of selected entities like dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, desmoid tumor, atypical fibroxanthoma, pleomorphic dermal sarcoma, and myxofibrosarcoma are discussed according to the WHO classification of 2013. The typical clinical feature of these tumors is their mostly asymptomatic appearance. For diagnosis, the histologic workup is therefore the key feature; herein immunohistochemistry as well as molecular diagnostics become increasingly important. THERAPY: The primary treatment for locally resectable tumors is complete surgical removal; chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted therapies with kinase inhibitors are available for inoperable and metastatic disease."
"Pediatric sarcomas are relatively rare malignancies individually. As a group they are typically approached with combination chemotherapies in addition to local control. Fortunately, these malignancies have been approached through careful clinical trial collaboration to define risk groups and appropriately deliver local control measures and systemic therapies. Although local disease is typically approached with curative intent, therapy typically lasts over 6 months and has significant associated morbidities. It is more difficult to cure metastatic disease or induce sustained remissions. In this article, we discuss recent advances in the understanding of the disease process and highlight recent and future cooperative group trials in osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas, and desmoid tumor as well as discuss promising therapeutic approaches such as epigenetics and immunotherapy."
"Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors are rare and most often occur in patients with a history of familial adenomatous polyposis, surgery, or pregnancy. We report a case of an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor mimicking the recurrence of gastric cancer. A 57-year-old male had undergone distal gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer. Serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen were found to be elevated 27 months after surgery. Computed tomography revealed a 15-mm mass in the mesentery of the transverse colon. In addition, radiotracer fluorodeoxyglucose uptake of the tumor was detected by positron emission tomography. The patient was diagnosed with gastric cancer recurrence, and chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and S-1 was commenced. After five courses of chemotherapy, although no significant clinical response was seen, no new lesions were seen either. Thus, a curative resection of the recurrent tumor seemed possible, which was successfully performed. Histological examination of the resected specimen revealed spindle-shaped tumor cells with collagen fiber progression; no cancer cells were detected. The tumor was diagnosed as an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor. We report a rare case of an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor that mimicked a recurrent tumor arising from gastric cancer. In patients with history of surgery for intra-abdominal malignancies, it may be difficult to distinguish the recurrence of malignancy from desmoid tumors but the possibility of desmoid tumors must be considered in the differential diagnosis."
"Angiogenesis is an integral process in carcinogenesis, and molecular inhibitors of angiogenic factors are currently being tested as treatments for cancer. Sunitinib is an oral multitargeted tyrosine-kinase inhibitor that blocks activation through the stem cell-factor receptor (Kit) and platelet-derived growth-factor receptor. Sunitinib has shown potent antitumor activity against several solid tumors, including renal cell carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and neuroendocrine tumors in several Phase II/III trials. Recently, sunitinib has been used to treat other solid cancers, such as lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, chondrosarcoma, esophageal cancer, bladder cancer, glioma, and aggressive fibromatosis, and also showed potential efficacy in progression-free survival and overall survival. In this review, we examine the efficacy of sunitinib as a molecular-targeted therapy in patients with different types of solid cancers."
"Gingival enlargement, one of the manifestations of gingival and periodontal disease, is also known as gingival overgrowth. Idiopathic gingival enlargement is a rare gingival overgrowth, which is of an undetermined cause. This unknown etiology has now been linked to specific genes and idiopathic gingival enlargement is at times referred to as hereditary gingival enlargement. This condition is a benign, slow growing proliferation of gingival tissues. Aggressive periodontitis is the rapid form of periodontal disease which is characterized by extensive periodontal tissue destruction, increased host-susceptibility toward periodontal disease progress and a genetic predilection toward disease occurrence. We present a rare case of idiopathic gingival fibromatosis associated with generalized aggressive periodontitis in a young female. The patient presented with classic clinical and radiographic presentation associated with gingival enlargement and aggressive periodontitis. The diagnosis was then confirmed by histopathological and neutrophil functions tests."
"Desmoid tumor (DT) is a common manifestation of Gardner's Syndrome (GS), although it is a rare condition in the general population. DT in patients with GS is usually located in the abdominal wall and/or intra-abdominal cavity. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a case of a 32 years-old female patient with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), who was already submitted to total colectomy and developed multiple DT, located in the abdominal wall and in the left breast. The patient underwent several surgical procedures, with a multidisciplinary team of surgeons. Wide surgical resections of the left breast and the abdominal wall tumors were performed in separate steps. Polypropylene mesh reconstruction and muscle flaps were needed to cover the defects of the thoracic and abdominal walls. After partial necrosis of the adipose-cutaneous flap in the abdomen that required a new skin graft, she had a satisfactory outcome with complete healing of the surgical incisions. DISCUSSION: DT is frequent in GS, however, breast localization is very rare, with few cases reported in the literature. Recurrence of DT is not negligible, even after a wide surgical resection. GS patients must be followed up closely, and clinical examination, associated with imaging studies, should be performed to detect any signs of tumor. CONCLUSION: DT represents one of the most significant causes of the morbidity and mortality that affects FAP patients following colectomy. In general, the surgical procedures to excise DT are highly complex, requiring a multidisciplinary team."
"Desmoids (aggressive fibromatosis) are defined as benign neoplasms of the connective tissue that arise from the deep muscle fascia, aponeurosis, tendons, and scar tissue. Recurrence rates between 40 and 80% were reported after surgery alone. We addressed the impact of radiation therapy (RT) in the management of aggressive fibromatosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A large literature review was performed, and the data was compared with the results of a multicenter study of the German Cooperative Group on Radiotherapy for Benign Diseases (GCG-BD). RESULTS: This analysis included 52 patients treated with RT. 37 patients received postoperative RT (20 patients after R2 resection and 17 patients after R1 resection). 15 patients received RT alone (6 patients with inoperable primary tumor and 9 patients with inoperable recurrent tumor). In the case of postoperative RT, a median dose of 50 Gy (range 50-60 Gy) was used; for definitive RT, a median dose of 55 Gy (range 55-65 Gy) was used. The local control rate was 79% for the whole group. The median follow-up was 44 month (range 8-62 months). CONCLUSION: Given the large number of patients, these data show that RT is highly effective in the treatment of desmoid tumors. RT is an attractive alternative to mutilating surgery."
"Ectopic liver tissue is a rare clinical entity; very few cases of extra peritoneal localization have been described in Literature. MATERIAL OF STUDY: A 54 years old male patient was admitted to our Institution because of thoraco - abdominal pain (lower left chest, left hypochondrium), and fever; CEA and CA 19-9 were in range, but alpha fetoprotein levels were high (880 IU / L); CT scan and NMR showed a thoraco - abdominal mass developing from the left hemidiaphragm, with infiltration of the cranial part of the spleen; no primitive liver tumors have been detected. A jejunal mesentery mass (6 cm in diameter) was also incidentally diagnosed. RESULTS: The patient underwent surgical resection of the thoraco - abdominal tumor and of the mesenteric mass. HISTOLOGY: hepatocellular carcinoma arising from ectopic islet of liver tissue on left hemidiaphragm; mesenteric desmoid tumor. CONCLUSIONS: The case we have observed showed a coexistence of two very rare tumors; carcinogenesis on ectopic liver should be suspected in this patient with a thoraco-abdominal mass with high alpha fetoprotein levels, in absence of primitive liver chronic diseases and cancer."
"The objective was to determine the usefulness of the tumor vessel sign for differentiating the groups of circumscribed hypervascular abdominopelvic mesenchymal tumors. METHODS: We enrolled a total of 4 groups such as patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) (26 patients), those with paraganglioma (9 patients), those with primary sarcomas (13 patients, excluding those with liposarcoma), and those with desmoid tumor (6 patients). The reviewers evaluated the presence of tumor vessels capable of directly tracing from the tumor margin to the named vessels. RESULTS: Twenty-five of 26 GIST cases, all of the paragangliomas, all of the primary sarcomas, and all of the desmoid tumors showed a positive sign. For the sign confirming GIST, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and diagnostic accuracy were 96.2%, 100%, 100%, 96.6%, and 98.1%, respectively. The values of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve have good or excellent diagnostic accuracies. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the sign is considered to be helpful for differentiating the 4 groups of tumors."

"Ablation techniques are widely used for solid malignant tumors in adults. There is no large series assessing the effectiveness of local ablative therapies in the treatment of malignant or aggressive benign lesions in children. OBJECTIVE: To review the existing evidence on the techniques and results of ablation for pediatric solid malignant or aggressive benign tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE for papers published between 1995 and 2012 that reported outcomes of radiofrequency, microwave and cryoablation, interstitial laser therapy, irreversible electroporation and percutaneous ethanol injection for patients younger than 18 years old. Data collection included factors related to the patient, tumor biology, ablation technique and cancer-specific endpoints. Additional series of predominantly adults including data on patients younger than 18 years old were also identified. RESULTS: We identified 28 patients treated by ablation in 29 regions: 5 patients undergoing ablation for liver lesions, 9 patients for lung metastases, 11 patients for bone and/or soft tissue and 4 patients for kidney or pancreas. The ablation was performed to treat primary tumors, local recurrences and metastases. The histology of the tumors was osteosarcoma in 6 patients, Wilms tumor in 3, rhabdomyosarcoma in 3, hepatoblastoma in 3, desmoid tumor in 3, adrenocortical carcinoma in 2 and a single case each of leiomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, paraganglioma, solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm, sacrococcygeal teratoma, hepatic adenoma, juxtaglomerular cell tumor and plantar fibromatosis. Eighteen of the patients (64%) experienced a complication, but only 6 (21%) of these needed treatment other than supportive care. CONCLUSIONS: Although ablative techniques are feasible and promising treatments for certain pediatric tumors, large multicenter prospective trials will be needed to establish efficacy."
"Desmoid tumors are rare soft tissue tumors with limited data on their management and prognosis. We sought to determine the rates of recurrence after surgery for desmoid tumors and analyze factors predictive of recurrence-free survival (RFS). From February 1976 to October 2011, 233 consecutive patients with desmoid tumors who underwent macroscopically complete resection were included in this study. Clinicopathologic and treatment characteristics were evaluated to determine predictors of recurrence. Patterns of presentation included primary (n = 156, 67.0 %) and locally recurrent (n = 77, 33.0 %) disease initially treated elsewhere. Most patients had a R0 resection (n = 169, 72.5 %). In addition to surgery, 43 (18.5 %) patients received radiotherapy and 10 (4.3 %) patients received systemic therapy. Median follow-up was 54 months; recurrence disease was observed in 62 (26.6 %) patients. The estimated 5- and 10-year RFS was 74.2 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 68.3-80.1) and 70.7 % (95 % CI, 64.2-77.2), respectively. Factors associated with worse RFS were tumor size larger than 5 cm (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.757; 95 % CI, 1.945-7.259; p < 0.001), extra-abdominal tumor location (abdominal wall referent; HR = 3.373; 95 % CI, 1.425-7.984; p = 0.006), and R1 resection status (HR = 1.901; 95 % CI, 1.140-3.171; p = 0.014). Patients were grouped according to the number of unfavorable prognostic factors; the 10-year RFS rates of patients with zero, one, two, and three prognostic factors were 100, 86.9, 48.5, and 34.4 %, respectively (p < 0.001). Regardless of primary or recurrent disease, surgical resection remains central to the management of patients with desmoid tumors. However, there are clearly different prognostic subgroups that could benefit from different therapeutic strategies, and a wait-and-see policy is a possible option for a subset of patients."
"T41A (16 cases), S45F (4 cases) and S45P (one case). The nuclear expression of beta-catenin correlated significantly with CTNNB1 mutation status (p = 0.035); all four cases with S45F mutation exhibited strong nuclear expression of beta-catenin. S45F mutation was significantly associated with a poor response (all cases; PD) (p = 0.017), whereas the other mutations had no impact on efficacy. The CTNNB1 mutation status was of significant prognostic value for meloxicam treatment in patients with sporadic desmoid tumors."
"Aggressive fibromatosis arising from the retroperitoneum is extremely rare. It may occur in association with previous trauma, abdominal surgery, drugs, Gardner's syndrome, or familial adenomatous polyposis. We report a case of retroperitoneal fibromatosis presenting as a presacral mass with an infiltrating nature, relatively intense enhancement on enhanced computed tomography scanning, and low-signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in a patient with no significant medical or surgical history."
"Abdominal desmoid tumors are so called non-metastatic tumors. They occur by proliferation of fibroblasts of muscle, fascia or aponeuroses. After breast reconstruction with a DIEP flap (Deep Inferior epigastric Artery Perforator Flap), a progressive growth of a desmoid tumor was seen around the DIEP-anastomosis. A total excision was not possible without compromising the vascular pedicle. With taking into account a recurrence rate up to 65% another operation is probably necessary. In this case the main vessels of the graft have to be cut out and a necrosis of the flap can or may appear."
"Desmoid tumors represent a particular type of fibromatosis. The common sites for extra-abdominal desmoid tumors, known as aggressive fibromatosis, are the shoulder, chest wall, and thigh. Desmiod tumors are rare at facet joints of the spine. We describe a patient with a desmoid tumor of a lumbar facet joint."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) is an uncommon nonmetastatic fibrous neoplasm. Sporadic intraperitoneal DTF is rarely described in current literature. We herein report a case of DTF of unknown cause involving the pancreatic head. A 41-year-old man presented with recurrent epigastric pain and weight loss. An abdominal computed tomography scan showed a well-delineated solid cystic mass inside the pancreatic head. Pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed due to the patient's debilitating symptoms and suspected malignancy. The pathological examination revealed massive fibroblastic proliferation arising from the musculoaponeurotic tissues, consistent with a diagnosis of DTF. Immunohistochemical phenotyping determined positive immunoreactivity to vimentin and beta-catenin, but negative immunoreactivity to smooth muscle actin, CD117, CD34, or S-100, confirming the diagnosis of DTF. No local recurrence or distant metastasis was found during a 24-month follow-up. Radical resection is recommended as first-line treatment for pancreatic DTF. Long-term follow-up studies are required to establish the prognosis of pancreatic DTF."
"Thoracoscopic left lower lobectomy with lymph node dissection for lung cancer was performed in a 76-year-old man. The diagnosis was pT2aN2M0 adenocarcinoma. Sixteen months after surgery, CT revealed a pleural tumor measuring 38 mm at the surgical port wound. CT-guided biopsy revealed fibroma. However, the tumor size increased 4 months after biopsy, and surgery was performed. An intraoperative diagnosis revealed benign fibroma. Thoracoscopic tumorectomy was conducted. The pathological diagnosis was desmoid tumor. As the margins of the resected specimen were positive, radiotherapy was performed. During the 16-month follow-up period, there has been no relapse. Pleural desmoid tumors must be differentiated from port-site relapse."
"desmoid-type fibromatosis, soft tissue sarcoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor. In general, limb-sparing and function-sparing approaches should be used when feasible for tumors located in the extremities and girdles. Resections of adherent structures/viscera, which may be close but not invaded, may be needed in tumors arising in the retroperitoneum/abdomen to minimize microscopic intralesional margins, maximize local tumor control, and possibly improve survival. Margins of resection and the use of adjuvant/neadjuvant radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy are contingent on an accurate histologic diagnosis. Treatment planning should include multidisciplinary consultation to determine optimal therapy, taking into consideration tumor histology, site and extent of the disease, its natural history and sensitivity to available treatments, surgical challenges, and-of course-quality of life."
"Desmoid tumor is a soft-tissue tumor of unknown cause. Since recurrence sometimes occurs even with complete resection, careful consideration of which portions to resect and close postoperative followup are recommended. Seventeen months after undergoing a right upper lobectomy for primary lung adenocarcinoma, a 65-year-old female patient experienced pleural tumor which located at the previous thoracotomy site, as revealed by chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT). While needle aspiration biopsy revealed no malignancy, recurrence of the cancer could not be ruled out clinically. The tumor was resected with chest wall and lung and the histopathological diagnosis was desmoid tumor. This case demonstrates the importance of conducting differential diagnosis with recurrence or desmoid tumor after operation to treat lung cancer. Five years after resection of the desmoid tumor, no recurrence is observed."
"We have experienced 6 cases with resection and reconstruction of sternum. They were 1 with osteosarcoma, 1 with synovial sarcoma, 1 with sternal metastasis of fallopian tube cancer, 1 with sternal metastasis of thyroid cancer, 1 with desmoid tumor, and 1 with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberance. Resection of both manubrium and sternum was performed in 3 cases and sternum resection in 3. There was no total resection. We used a titanium reconstruction plate and titanium mesh in 3 cases, a titanium reconstruction plate and polypropylene mesh in 2, titanium mesh in 1 for reconstruction of bony defect, and rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap in 3, pectralis major muscle flap in 2, latissimus doris myocutaneous flap in 1 for reconstruction of soft tissue defect. Postoperative courses were uneventful, and flail chest was not observed. Reconstruction of the bony defect of the anterior chest wall with the titanium reconstruction plate and titanium mesh or polypropylene mesh was effective by providing sufficient rigidity as well as protection of the thoracic organs."

"Extra-abdominal desmoid tumors are rare, locally aggressive neoplasms without metastatic potential. There is no clear consensus regarding their optimal management. The disappointing results of current treatments and the ability of extra-abdominal desmoid tumors to spontaneously stabilize have increasingly drawn interest toward conservative management. The objective of this study was to evaluate a wait-and-see policy as a first-line management for extra-abdominal desmoid tumors. METHODS: This two-center retrospective study involved fifty-five patients with a histologically proven extra-abdominal desmoid tumor. The primary outcome was the cumulative probability of dropping out from the wait-and-see policy. The wait-and-see policy included aggressive management of symptoms. We conducted a review of the relevant published series in which a watchful-waiting strategy was used. RESULTS: The cumulative probability of dropping out from the wait-and-see policy was 9.6% at the time of the last follow-up. Spontaneous arrest of tumor growth was noted for forty-seven patients (85%) over the course of the study. Half of the tumors were stabilized at one year, and a potential to increase beyond three years was a sporadic event (one case). Regrowth was found in two patients (4%). CONCLUSIONS: A wait-and-see policy is an effective front-line management for patients with primary or recurrent extra-abdominal desmoid tumor. These tumors tend to stabilize spontaneously, on average after one year of evolution, and the cumulative probability of the failure of a wait-and-see policy is approximately 10%."
"This is an atypical case report of a 20-year-old male patient who suffered from unusual unilateral, gingival enlargement together with rapidly progressive alveolar bone loss. The enlarged gingiva completely covered his left posterior teeth in both arches. The patient was diagnosed with gingival fibromatosis and aggressive periodontitis based on the clinical, histological, and radiographic findings. The gingival enlargement was treated by conventional gingivectomy under local anaesthesia. The postoperative result was uneventful."
"Aggressive juvenile fibromatosis of the jawbones is a rare tumor presenting as infiltrative mass with unpredictable evolution. We report herein a 17-year-old student with a 6-month history of radiologically proven resorption of a part of the mandible, lingual displacement of tooth 34 and malocclusion. Alveolar ridge resorption and three dark-brown foci in the bone were seen after the tooth was extracted. Histological study showed the tumor tissue to have a bundle-like structure; immunohistochemically it was positive for vimentin, smooth muscle actin, beta-catenin, Ki-67 (5%), and negative for desmin and cytokeratin 34bE12. The golden standard in the diagnostics of desmoid fibromatoses is the nuclear or membrane expression of beta-catenin, which is found in 90% of the cases. Differential diagnosis include mandibular fibroma, well-differentiated fibrosarcoma, fibrosing histiocytoma, and infiltration from adjacent soft-tissue tumor. Aggressive juvenile fibromatosis should be managed by radical excision. Local recurrences are not rare, but metastases do not develop. In rare cases this type of fibromatosis has been known to regress spontaneously. Aggressive fibromatosis is a diagnostic challenge, since it remains in the grey zone between benign and malignant lesions of the oral cavity."

"Desmoid tumors (DTs) are rare tumors classified as deep fibromatoses taking origin from fascial or musculoaponeurotic structures. With pregnancy and surgical scars considered in the etiology, most anterior abdominal wall DTs occur in women in their reproductive years, especially during a pregnancy or post-partum. Herein, we present development of DT in a female patient in the post-partum period following cesarean delivery, which manifested itself with a growing mass in anterior abdominal wall. In our case, possibility of hematoma most probably located beneath the fascia was considered initially as a complication of cesarean section based on ultrasonographic examination and location of the lesion, while upon lack of either spontaneous regression with eventual diminish in size or resolve of symptoms within six weeks, further investigation via MRI and tru-cut biopsy revealed the diagnosis of abdominal DT. Radical tumor extirpation with resection of an adequate margin of surrounding normal tissue was applied, and the post-operative period was uneventful."
"Desmoid tumors (DTs) are benign tumors that exhibit fibroblastic proliferation, which arises from fascial or musculoaponeurotic structures. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics and outcomes of patients with resectable DTs. A total of 21 patients were included and their clinicopathological characteristics were retrospectively analyzed. The 21 patients (16 females and 5 males) were identified through reviewing the patient charts at our institute. The tumor was located in the lower extremities in 7 cases, in the upper extremities in 4 cases, in the abdominal region in 9 cases and in the neck region in 1 case. Patients who had been initially treated by surgical excision were included in the study. Of these 21 patients, a positive surgical margin (SM) was reported in 11 patients, 7 of whom received postoperative radiotherapy (RT). Ten patients had a negative SM and 6 received RT. A total of 5 patients (46%) in the positive SM group and 4 (40%) in the negative SM group had documented disease relapse (P>0.05). The median relapse-free survival (RFS) was 20.5 months for the patients treated by surgery alone and 50 months for those treated with surgery followed by adjuvant RT (P>0.05). Age, gender, SM and adjuvant RT were not identified as predictors of recurrence. No predictive factors appeared to indicate local DT recurrence following surgery."
"The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of surgical treatment of aggressive fibromatosis and the effects of prognostic factors on recurrence. METHODS: Forty patients (24 female, 16 male; average age: 31.2 years) diagnosed with aggressive fibromatosis were evaluated retrospectively. Nine patients with tumor-positive surgical margins macroscopically were excluded. Prognostic factors such as age, gender, localization, admission status, compartment status, surgical margin, tumor size and adjuvant radiotherapy were evaluated. RESULTS: Recurrence rate was 29%. Average disease free survival was 46+/-4 months. There was no statistically significant relation between prognostic factors and recurrence. Clinical results of the patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy were more satisfactory. CONCLUSION: Adjuvant radiotherapy administration appears to be a rational treatment method instead of sacrificing function to achieve wide surgical margins."
"Desmoid fibromatosis (DF) carries a significant morbidity and a recognised mortality. Despite this there are currently limited diagnostic or treatment algorithms specific to cases of extra-abdominal DF. Historically surgical excision has formed the cornerstone of treatment. Recently however a paradigm shift has meant many practitioners now adopt a more conservative approach, placing emphasis on active surveillance, function preserving resections, and non-surgical oncologic therapies. METHODS: We performed an 8-year retrospective review of all cases of extra-abdominal DF managed within our region to assess the consistency of diagnostics, management and long-term outcome. RESULTS: 47 eligible cases were identified. Mean age at diagnosis was 41.3 years (1-81 years). Disease location and speciality of diagnosing practitioners were varied. Management was generally inconsistent. Variation was seen in imaging, biopsy techniques, MDT involvement and management. At a median follow up of 4.9 years our local recurrence rate was 19%. DISCUSSION: The optimal management of DF is unknown. This has led to a lack of formalised guidance for practitioners managing this challenging condition, resulting in inconsistencies and areas for improvement in current management. We propose a diagnostic pathway which may improve consistency of care, reduce potentially unnecessary surgery and the associated morbidity, and significantly increase the rate of complete (R0) surgical resections when surgery is deemed appropriate whilst not significantly worsening oncological outcome. Specifically we propose all cases should be imaged appropriately (usually with MRI), undergo a planned biopsy (by radiologically guided core needle biopsy) and be managed centrally in conjunction with multidisciplinary sarcoma units."
"A 28-year-old woman visited a local medical doctor, complaining of abdominal pain, urinary frequency and a sense of residual urine. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a lower abdominal extraperitoneal tumor, approximately 5 cm in diameter, adjacent to the bladder dome. It was thought to be a urachal tumor, and she was referred to our hospital. A hard hen's egg-sized mass was palpable in the lower abdomen. Urinary analysis was normal. Cytological examination was also negative. Cystoscopy revealed redness in the bladder dome mucosa. Although the preoperative diagnosis was a urachal cancer, the pathological diagnosis on surgery was desmoids, and tumor excision was performed. No recurrence has been seen for 7 years postoperatively. CASE 2: A 71-year-old man complaining of swelling of the lower abdomen was referred to our department because he was suspected to have a urachal tumor, of about 15 cm in diameter, on computed tomography. A hard infant head-sized mass was palpable in the lower abdomen. Urinary analysis was normal. Cystoscopical examination showed a markedly compressed bladder dome, however, no abnormal findings were seen in the mucosa. Although the preoperative diagnosis was a urachal tumor, the intraoperative pathological diagnosis revealed no malignancy. The mass was connected to the bladder dome, and partial cystectomy was conducted. The final pathological diagnosis was a solitary fibrous tumor. No recurrence has been seen for 5 years postoperatively. Because a urachal tumor is highly malignant, radical cystectomy and urinary diversion might be planned preoperatively. However, care should be taken not to be too invasive, considering the possibility of a benign tumor."
"The iliotibial band is a thick, condensed fascia that, when contracted, leads to a hip flexion, abduction, and external rotation contracture in addition to other joint contractures. Iliotibial band tightness occurs secondary to iliotibial band friction syndrome, which commonly occurs at the lateral femoral epicondylar region. However, a proximal cause of iliotibial band/tensor fascia lata friction syndrome leading to a secondary hip contracture is swelling around the hip; this swelling being a desmoid tumor has not been explicitly described in the literature. The authors present a rare case of a hip contracture in a 28-year-old active man who presented with a functionally disabling hip flexion contracture of 20 degrees with further flexion possible up to 130 degrees , a 45 degrees abduction contracture, and a 20 degrees external rotation contracture with further rotation possible up to 40 degrees with a bony hard swelling in the left gluteal region. Ober's test was positive. Opposite hip and spine examinations were normal. The goals of treatment were to establish the causality between the 2 and to diagnose the etiology of the gluteal mass. Radiographs were normal, with only a pelvic obliquity evident. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an extra-articular mass abutting the iliac blade. Histopathology confirmed the mass to be a desmoid tumor in the left gluteal region. A wide surgical excision of the mass was performed with negative margins; no postoperative radiotherapy was administered. After rigorous physiotherapy, the hip deformity disappeared at 6 months and there was no evidence of recurrence at 2.5-year follow-up, with the patient able to sit cross-legged and squat."

"Classic autosomal-dominant familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is clinically defined by the development of hundreds to thousands of colorectal adenomas beginning in childhood and adolescence. A variant of FAP characterized by polyposis in combination with osteomas or soft tissue tumours is called Gardner's syndrome. FAP is caused by germline inactivation of the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) tumour-suppressor gene located on the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q21-5q22). Cytogenetically visible deletions of chromosome 5q encompassing APC have very rarely been reported. Here, we aimed to phenotypically and genetically characterize a patient with a heterozygous 5q deletion resulting in Gardner's syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 26-year-old female patient with mild mental handicap and dysmorphic features due to a cytogenetically visible deletion on chromosome 5q (microscopically estimated region 5q14-5q23) presented at our tertiary referral centre because of mild adenomatous polyposis (<500 polyps). Twenty months after prophylactic proctocolectomy with definitive ileostomy, three rapidly growing desmoids were observed. Tumour-associated complications necessitated a multidisciplinary approach including medical treatment, surgery and radiation therapy. The characterization of the deletion by comparative genomic hybridization identified a large 5q deletion expanding over a 20-Mb region (5q21.3-5q23.3) including the APC gene. CONCLUSION: Chromosome deletions must be suspected in patients presenting with FAP together with mental handicap and dysmorphic features. This case also impressively shows that FAP-associated desmoids need multimodal treatment taking into account the patient's individual symptoms, disease progression and tumour location."
"The abdominal mesenteries are important peritoneal structures that give rise to a wide spectrum of abnormalities, including solid mesenteric masses. Despite similarities in appearance, solid masses in the mesentery may have diverse etiologies, ranging from benign to highly malignant. While metastases are the most common cause of solid masses in the mesentery, other less common conditions are also important diagnostic considerations. This article reviews four pathologic entities (sclerosing mesenteritis, carcinoid tumors, desmoids tumors, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors) that may be manifested on abdominal imaging examinations by one or more mesenteric masses. These four pathologic entities are used to present a systematic approach to the radiographic characterization of solid mesenteric masses based on the morphology of the lesions, locoregional effects, and distant findings on various abdominal imaging examinations."
"Elective proctocolectomy has been recommended for patients at high risk of desmoids based on the possibility that cancer in a retained rectum may be unresectable because of desmoid disease. There are no data to support the reality of this concern. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to see how often proctectomy was prevented by desmoids. DESIGN: This retrospective, descriptive, database study was augmented by chart review. SETTING: This study was conducted at a hereditary colorectal cancer clinic in a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Those presenting for proctectomy after colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis for familial adenomatous polyposis were selected. INTERVENTIONS: Patients underwent a proctectomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes measured were the rate of proctectomy, rate of IPAA, and the incidence of desmoid disease. RESULTS: Sixty- seven patients, 34 men and 33 women, underwent an operation with the intent of performing proctectomy. Mean age at surgery was 39.7 years, an average of 175 months from ileorectal anastomosis. Indications for proctectomy were uncontrollable adenomas in 56, cancer in 8, and high-grade dysplasia in 3. Proctectomy was always possible. Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis was planned in 62 patients; 54 had this operation. Desmoid disease was found in 26 patients (38.8%) and influenced surgery in 13 cases, stopping pouch-anal anastomosis in 8. One patient had no resection, 2 had a pouch-low rectal anastomosis, and 5 had proctectomy and ileostomy. Proctectomy and ileostomy was planned in 5 patients and performed in all. LIMITATIONS: This is a retrospective review from a single institution. CONCLUSION: The fear of an unresectable rectum or an impossible pouch-anal anastomosis should not be an indication for proctectomy in patients with low rectal polyp counts but a high risk for desmoid disease."
"Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a locally invasive soft tissue tumor with rare malignant potential, but a high tendency for local recurrence. We present 2 cases of DFSP involving the head and neck requiring tissue expansion for reconstruction. METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical records for 2 patients with DFSP was performed. Data concerning the operative approaches, reconstructive strategies, details of tissue expansion, and outcomes were collected. RESULTS: Case 1: A 4-year-old child with a large DFSP infiltrating her entire anterolateral neck and shoulder. Case 2: A 34-year old woman with a large DFSP involving the scalp overlaying the anterior-frontal scalp. Both patients underwent successful tumor resection and reconstruction; however, the timing of tissue expander placement and final reconstruction differed. CONCLUSIONS: These cases present the challenges of soft tissue reconstruction of the head and neck following tumor extirpation. In addition, we discuss the important considerations for tissue expansion prior to tumor resection versus after tumor resection and free flap reconstruction."
"Desmoid tumour (DT) is a main cause of death after prophylactic colectomy in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of prophylactic laparoscopic colectomy on the risk of developing DT in patients with FAP. METHODS: The database of a single institution was reviewed. Patients with classical FAP with defined genotype who underwent either open or laparoscopic colectomy between 1947 and 2011 were included in the study. The impact of various demographic and clinical features on the risk of developing DT was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 672 patients underwent prophylactic colectomy: 602 by an open and 70 by a laparoscopic approach. With a median (range) follow-up of 132 (0-516) months in the open group and 60 (12-108) months in the laparoscopic group, 98 patients (16.3 per cent) developed DT after an open procedure compared with three (4 per cent) following laparoscopic surgery. The estimated cumulative risk of developing DT at 5 years after surgery was 13.0 per cent in the open group and 4 per cent in the laparoscopic group (P = 0.042). In multivariable analysis, female sex (hazard ratio (HR) 2.18, 95 per cent confidence interval 1.40 to 3.39), adenomatous polyposis coli mutation distal to codon 1400 (HR 3.85, 1.90 to 7.80), proctocolectomy (HR 1.67, 1.06 to 2.61), open colectomy (HR 6.84, 1.96 to 23.98) and year of surgery (HR 1.04, 1.01 to 1.07) were independent risk factors for the diagnosis of DT after prophylactic surgery. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic surgery decreased the risk of DT after prophylactic colectomy in patients with FAP."
"Deep extra-abdominal fibromatoses (desmoids) are rare benign fibrous mesenchymal tumours occurring in adults, which may mimic primary malignancy on imaging. We present a case of a 64-year-old man with a hard painless lump in his left calf. The solid and partially hypervascular appearance on ultrasound, the infiltrative appearance, lesion heterogeneity and heterogeneous enhancement pattern on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) were suspicious for a soft tissue sarcoma. Moreover, PET-CT demonstrated FDG-avidity. Despite these aggressive imaging features, histopathology revealed a benign but locally aggressive desmoid tumour. The radiologist should be aware that PET-CT is not always helpful as an additional tool for differentiation between malignant and benign soft tissue lesions. Intralesional bandlike areas of low signal intensity on all pulse MR sequences and intimate relationship with the muscle fascia are more useful clues to the diagnosis of this soft tissue lesion."
"Many women who present with desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) have had a recent pregnancy. Long-term data about disease behavior during and after pregnancy are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possible relationship between DF and pregnancy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of women with DF and pregnancy was identified from 4 sarcoma centers. Four groups were identified: diagnosis during pregnancy (A); diagnosis after delivery (B); DF clinically evident during pregnancy (C); and DF resected before pregnancy (D). Progression/regression rates, recurrence rates after resection, and obstetric outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Ninety-two women were included. Forty-four women (48%) had pregnancy-related DF (A + B), whereas 48 (52%) had a history of DF before conception (C + D). Initial treatment was resection in 52%, medical therapy in 4%, and watchful waiting in 43%. Postsurgical relapse rate in A + B was 13%, although progression during watchful waiting was 63%. Relapse/progression in C + D was 42%. After pregnancy, 46% underwent treatment of DF, whereas 54% were managed with watchful waiting. Eventually, only 17% experienced further progression after treatment. Spontaneous regression occurred in 14%. After further pregnancies, only 27% progressed. The only related obstetric event was a cesarean delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy-related DF has good outcomes. Progression risk during pregnancy is high, but it can be safely managed. DF does not increase obstetric risk, and it should not be a contraindication to future pregnancy."
"This study aimed to investigate the expression profile of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in desmoid tumor specimens and to evaluate the correlation of intratumoral COX-2 expression with pain status. METHODS: Sixteen patients with histologically proven desmoid tumors who attended our institution between 2003 and 2010 were enrolled in this study. COX-2 protein expression in desmoid tumors was determined by immunohistochemistry. COX-2 - positive cells had similar morphology to that of mast cells, and therefore, immunohistochemical staining for tryptase was performed in co-localized sections. The number of COX-2 -positive cells in 10 consecutive fields was counted at 400x magnification. Patients were stratified into 2 groups according to the number of COX-2- positive cells, the COX-2 -positive group (>==10 COX-2 -positive cells) and the COX-2 -negative group (<10 COX-2 -positive cells). The prevalence of painful tumors was compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: COX-2 was expressed in 9 patients (56%). COX-2 proteins were expressed not in tumor cells but in tryptase-positive mast cells in the stroma of desmoid tumors. 6 of 9 patients in COX-2 -positive group had painful tumors. This difference was statistically significant according to the chi-squared test (p = 0 .036), suggesting a positive correlation between COX-2 expression and tumor-associated pain. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that COX-2 secretion from mast cells modulates desmoid tumor-associated pain. In addition, mast cells may at least in part contribute to the pathogenesis of desmoid tumors.

"A 6-year-old Haflinger mare was presented with a history of recurrent hemoabdomen. On necropsy, a firm infiltrative multinodular yellow mass was observed in the wall of the posterior abdomen. Histopathologic examination revealed a proliferation of fibroblastic cells, which were positive for alpha-smooth muscle actin and vimentin."
"To review our experience regarding the difference in management and treatment outcomes of aggressive fibromatosis of the head and neck region in children and adults, emphasizing, in particular, the role of conservative surgery in comprehensive treatment strategies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients with aggressive fibromatosis was performed during a 5-year period (2008 to 2012). Nine patients were enrolled in the present study, including 5 children (age, <18 years) and 4 adults (age, >18 years). All patients underwent surgical intervention and were treated by surgical resection with different surgical margins. Adjuvant low-dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy were given to pediatric and adult patients, respectively, with macroscopically or microscopically positive surgical margins. RESULTS: All 5 pediatric patients (3 females and 2 males) received low-dose chemotherapy after conservative surgical resection (in 4 patients, microscopically incomplete resection; and in 1 patient, macroscopic residual tumor). Of the 4 adults (3 females and 1 male), 2 underwent complete surgical resection and 2 underwent surgery and postoperative radiotherapy (1 patient had microscopically suspected residual tumor and 1 had macroscopic residual tumor). The patients were followed up for a period of 7 to 51 months. Two pediatric patients and one adult patient had disease progression after resection and became stable after continued adjuvant therapy. None of the patients had functional or cosmetic defects. All patients had good long-term outcomes, with no disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of aggressive fibromatosis, conservative resection with preservation of form and function should be given greater priority in all age groups. Also, postoperative adjuvant therapy is vital for patients with gross or microscopic residual tumor to obtain progression-free survival."
"Study Design Case report. Objective The objective of the article is to illustrate a case of desmoid tumor (DT) formation after posterior instrumentation of the thoracic spine. Methods A 57-year-old woman presented with lower extremity clumsiness, balance, and ambulation difficulty resulting from spinal cord compression due to an upper thoracic atypical vertebral hemangioma. Ten months after undergoing embolization, resection, and placement of instrumentation for this lesion, the patient developed a growing mass at the rostral end of the incision. Biopsy revealed desmoid fibromatosis. The mass was removed via an en bloc resection. Histology revealed an infiltrative DT above the laminectomy site abutting the instrumentation. Results At 2-year follow-up, there was no evidence of recurrence of the tumor. Conclusion Paraspinal DTs have been reported in the literature to develop after surgical procedures of the spine. Often times, patients attribute swelling or fullness at the site of their surgery to scar tissue formation or instrumentation. One must consider the possibility of a DT in the setting of reported surgical site fullness or mass after spine surgery. It is thought that postoperative inflammation present in the surgical bed may promote formation of DTs. Instrumentation may also contribute to inflammation and increase the likelihood of developing a DT. Generous margins must be taken to prevent recurrence."
"Synovial sarcoma is rare, aggressive, malignant mesenchymal neoplasm. The recent literature does not validate its only prevalence in the extremities of the adult population. Statistics reveal that adult population has the highest prevalence rate; 30 % of reported cases occur in the children and adolescents. It is very rare in pregnancy. Carcinomas may be diagnosed concurrently with pregnancy in approximately 0.1 % of cases, but sarcomas are rare. We report a 21-year-old woman with synovial sarcoma on anterior abdominal wall at 34th week of gestation, which was clinically diagnosed as desmoid tumor. Tumor was totally excised. After 6 months, it relapsed in the form of multiple abdominal wall swellings and ascites."
"The desmoid tumor is an uncommon neoplasm that occurs sporadically or as a part of inherited syndrome. Desmoid tumors are benign, but may infiltrate adjacent structures. Rarely severe and fatal, clinical problems are seen if mesenteric vessels or abdominal organs are involved. Ileum is one of the rare sites and literature search regarding this yielded scant results. Hence, we decided to report this case of aggressive desmoid tumors of the abdominal wall infiltrating ileum."
"Although fibromatosis of the mesentery is a very rare locally aggressive benign condition, the uncertain treatment modalities, the natural history of the disease, and the other common differential diagnosis of the condition along with inexperience of the general clinicians with this disease pose a challenge to the professionals. The prolonged periods of stability and even regression in size of the tumor offer a hope for treatment. Accounting for 0.03 % of all neoplasms, it is also known as deep fibromatosis and desmoid tumor. Here, we discuss one case of primary mesenteric fibromatosis in a young male patient who presented to us with chronic abdominal pain after he was treated for acid peptic disease for the same at a local hospital. This case shows how management of this disease can be delayed due to unfamiliarity among clinicians of this condition. In our patient, a palliative surgical management plan was undertaken due to symptomatic mass in the abdomen, owing to unresectability."
"A middle aged housewife presented with an anterior abdominal wall mass which was slowly growing over a period of 1 years over the midline scar of previous caesarean section with cystic degeneration in a part of the tumor. Fine needle aspiration cytology revealed a papillary serous cystadenoma. At exploratory laparotomy tumor was seen arising from the ventral surface of the parietal peritoneum with normal viscera, omentum and ovaries. The pathologist reported the tumor as Benign Multicystic Peritoneal Mesothelioma. It is a rare but clinically favourable neoplasm with wide excision as the definitive treatment. Of the 130 cases reported in the literature, it has the least incidence in the Indian Subcontinent."
"Several studies have reported that imatinib may induce tumor responses and prolonged disease stabilization in aggressive fibromatosis (AF). This effect may relate to the PDGFR-beta pathway and KIT mutations. Sunitinib not only inhibits PDGFRs, KIT, and FLT3, it also blocks VEGFRs and thus serves as an antiangiogenic agent. The aim of this prospective multicenter uncontrolled study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sunitinib in patients with advanced AF. Nineteen patients with pathologically proven AF were recruited between June, 2008, and March, 2012, from three centers. One treatment cycle consisted of 37.5 mg/day sunitinib for 4 weeks without a break. The primary endpoint was tumor response rate according to RECIST 1.0. Ten (53 %) patients were female and the median age was 30 years (range, 22-67). Most of the primary sites were intra-abdominal (12, 63.2 %), and AF associated with familial adenomatous polyposis in ten patients (52.6 %). With a median of six cycles per patients (range, 1-47 cycles), five patients (26.3 %) achieved a partial response and eight (42.1 %) had stable disease. The overall response rate was 26.3 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 6.3-45.7) in intention-to-treat analysis. With a median follow-up time of 20.3 months (range, 1.8-50.7), the 2-year rates of progression-free and overall survival were 74.7 % and 94.4 %, respectively. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events of sunitinib that occurred in >5 % of patients were neutropenia (33.3 %), diarrhea (5.3 %), and hand-foot syndrome (5.3 %). In 3 of 12 patients with mesenteric AF, mesenteric mass bleeding (n = 1), bowel perforation (n = 1), and bowel fistula (n = 1) with tumor mass necrosis were observed early during sunitinib treatment. Therefore, sunitinib showed potential antitumor activity and may be useful for the management of non-mesenteric AF."
"Desmoid tumor, or aggressive fibromatosis, is a rare, histologically benign, fibroblastic lesion that infrequently presents in the head and neck. Desmoid tumors often grow locally, invasively, and may, in rare instances, be fatal secondary to invasion into critical structures, such as airway or major vessels. The most common treatment is surgery, but desmoid tumors are characteristically associated with a high local recurrence rate after resection. Although the margin status seems to be of importance, operations that avoid function loss and esthetic disfigurement should be the primary goal. The efficacy of postoperative radiotherapy is controversial. Its potential benefit should be carefully balanced against possible radiation-induced adverse effects. Alternative treatment modalities, such as primary radiotherapy and medical treatment or a wait-and-see policy, may be preferable to mutilating surgery. Considering all the aforementioned, it seems obvious that desmoid tumors of the head and neck present a therapeutic challenge and require an individualized approach."
"Insulin-like growth factor II messenger RNA-binding protein 3 (IMP3) is a recently identified biomarker demonstrated to be useful in diagnosis and prognostic prediction for several kinds of malignant tumors. However, the clinicopathologic and diagnostic value of IMP3 in mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract is not clear. In this study, we examined the immunohistochemical expression of IMP3 in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) (n = 150), malignant melanoma (n = 17), malignant mesothelioma (n = 6), leiomyosarcoma (n = 6), inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) (n = 12), desmoid fibromatosis (n = 8), leiomyoma (n = 20), and schwannoma (n = 20). Focal (>/=10%) or diffuse (>/=50%) expression with strong staining for IMP3 was judged as positive. We found that malignant melanomas (16/17 cases, 94.1%), malignant mesotheliomas (5/6 cases, 83.3%), IMTs (7/12 cases, 58.3%), and leiomyosarcomas (2/6 cases, 33.3%) were positive for IMP3. Among IMTs and leiomyosarcomas, IMP3-positive cases were histologically and/or clinically aggressive subtypes. Other kinds of tumors, including GIST, desmoid fibromatosis, leiomyoma and schwannoma, were essentially negative for IMP3. Our results suggest that IMP3 may be an ancillary tool in identifying aggressive abdominal mesenchymal tumors other than GIST."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) represents a group of tumors with a variable and unpredictable clinical course, characterized by a monoclonal proliferation of myofibroblastic cells. The optimal treatment for AF remains unclear. Identification and validation of genes whose expression patterns are associated with AF may elucidate biological mechanisms in AF, and aid treatment selection. This study was designed to examine the protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) of four genes, ADAM12, FAP, SOX11, and WISP1, that were found in an earlier study to be uniquely overexpressed in AF compared with normal tissues. Digital image analysis was performed to evaluate inter- and intratumor heterogeneity, and correlate protein expression with histologic features, including a histopathologic assessment of tumor activity, defined by nuclear chromatin density ratio (CDR). AF tumors exhibited marked inter- and intratumor histologic heterogeneity. Pathologic assessment of tumor activity and digital assessment of average nuclear size and CDR were all significantly correlated. IHC revealed protein expression of all four genes. IHC staining for ADAM12, FAP, and WISP1 correlated with CDR and was higher, whereas SOX11 staining was lower in tumors with earlier recurrence following excision. All four proteins were expressed, and the regional variation in tumor activity within and among AF cases was demonstrated. A spatial correlation between protein expression and nuclear morphology was observed. IHC also correlated with the probability of recurrence following excision. These proteins may be involved in AF pathogenesis and the corresponding pathways could serve as potential targets of therapy."
"To determine the tolerability, effectiveness and outcomes of percutaneous image-guided cryoablation on inoperable extra-abdominal desmoid tumors. METHODS: Between 2011 and 2012, 13 patients (mean age 39.3 years, range 15-74) with inoperable extra-abdominal desmoid tumors were consecutively treated with cryoablation (17 tumors treated in 17 procedures), including two patients with Gardner syndrome and nine recurrences after surgery. Disease-free survival (DFS) and local control based on RECIST criteria were calculated on prospective clinical and imaging follow-up until 2013. RESULTS: Cryoablation was performed under ultrasound (n = 8), computed tomography (n = 1), or combined (n = 8) guidance, and under general (n = 15) or local (n = 2) anesthesia. A major complication was observed in one session (5.8%). Mean follow-up was 11.3 months (6-27 months). Among all the patients treated, eight patients (47%) presented residual tumors on the first magnetic resonance follow-up, which were asymptomatic. The DFS rate was stable at 82.3% (95% confidence interval 0.55-0.94) at 6, 12, and 24 months. The local tumor progression rate was 0% at 6, 12, and 24 months. Two patients (12%) presented an in situ recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high rates of partial ablation, percutaneous image-guided cryoablation appears to be safe and effective for local control for patients with inoperable extra-abdominal desmoid tumors."
"We report a case of familial adenomatous polyposis( FAP) presenting with thyroid cancer. A 24-year-old woman, on histological examination, was diagnosed as having the cribriform-morular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma, which is known to be associated with FAP. Therefore, she underwent colonoscopy, and FAP was diagnosed. In addition, abdominal computed tomography( CT) scans revealed a tumor, approximately 12 cm in diameter, in the right lower abdomen. After total thyroidectomy, total proctocolectomy and excision of the tumor arising from the mesentery of the small intestines were performed. The histological diagnosis was FAP with a desmoid tumor arising from the mesentery."
"Fibromatoses are a heterogeneous group of distinct entities which differ in biological behaviour, but arehistologically very similar. This group of fibrous tumor or tumor like lesions, present considerable difficulties in pathologic diagnosis. Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) of the oral or para-oral structures is a very uncommon finding and its intra-osseous component is even relatively unusual. Such lesions with their origin from within the bone are termed desmoplastic fibromatosis (DF). These lesions must be distinguished from other fibroblastic tumors of the head and neck such as benign fibrous histiocytoma (BFH), fibrosarcoma, nerve sheath tumors and tumors of muscular origin. The major challenge in dealing with lesions of fibromatosis is to avoid an overdiagnosis of fibrosarcoma or an underdiagnosis of reactive fibrosis.Problems of differential diagnosis concern a wide range of diseases and immunohistochemical analysis may be helpful in diagnosis. With respect to the patient's post-operative well-being and if periodic follow-ups are guaranteed, the tumor should be carefully resected with only narrow safety margins. A rare case of aggressive desmoplastic fibromatosis in a 12-year-old girl is presented in this article with emphasis on the need and challenges for diagnosing such lesions as they have to be differentiated from other soft tissue tumors which display borderline pathological features regarding benign or malignant behaviour. Synonyms listed for the same include extra-abdominal desmoids, extra-abdominal fibromatosis, desmoids tumor, aggressive fibromatosis, juvenile desmoids-type fibromatosis, infantile fibromatosis."
"This study aimed to determine the prevalence of beta-catenin nuclear positivity as a prognostic factor in patients with desmoid tumors (DTs) treated with meloxicam, a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitor. Between 2003 and 2012, consecutive 31 patients with extraabdominal, sporadic DTs were prospectively treated with meloxicam as a systemic medical therapy. Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed material to quantify the nuclear expression of beta-catenin and Ki-67, and cytoplasmic expression of COX-2. All clinicopathological characteristics including the intensity of immunohistochemical staining were analyzed with respect to their prognostic value for meloxicam treatment. Of the 31 patients with meloxicam treatment, there was 1 with complete remission (CR), 7 with partial remission (PR), 12 with stable disease (SD), and 11 with progressive disease (PD). Higher nuclear expression of beta-catenin was significantly associated with a poor response (PD/SD) (p = 0.017). The positivity of COX-2 and Ki-67 and none of the other clinical variables were associated with prognosis. The nuclear expression of beta-catenin can predict the efficacy of meloxicam treatment for patients with sporadic DTs."
"Desmoid tumors (DTs) are nonmetastatic, locally aggressive neoplasms with a high rate of postoperative recurrence. Pancreatic DTs are especially rare; only a few cases have been reported to date. This paper describes a case of a sporadic cystic DT of the pancreas managed successfully with central pancreatectomy, with no signs of recurrence 40 mo after surgery. According to the literature, this is the first reported case in China of a pancreatic DT presenting as a solid cystic lesion, as well as the first pancreatic DT managed with central pancreatectomy and pancreaticogastrostomy. We report the case for its rarity and emphasize disease management by concerted application of clinical, pathological, radiological and immunohistochemical analyses."
"Aggressive (deep or desmoid-type) fibromatoses are locally infiltrative collagen-forming tumours with potential for recurrence but not metastasis. They exert their clinical effects primarily in relation to location and have variable biological behaviour. In sporadic cases there are somatic mutations in the beta-catenin (CTNNB1) gene on 3p21, resulting in immunohistochemically demonstrable overexpression in nuclei. Fibromatosis in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) harbours inactivating germline mutations in the desmoid region of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene on 5q21-q22. The differential diagnosis includes other myofibroblastic lesions, perineurioma, low grade fibromyxoid sarcoma and, in the abdomen, gastrointestinal stromal tumour and liposarcoma with 'low-grade' dedifferentiation. The primary management is surgical, though some desmoids cease to grow and can be watched. Other therapies have a role in stabilising growth or shrinking tumours. Although no single therapy is effective in all cases, available modalities including irradiation, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, and receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition can be of value in appropriate clinicopathological subgroups."
"Desmoid tumors are rare, soft-tissue neoplasms that do not metastasize, but exhibit aggressive growth and local invasion. They originate most frequently from abdominal fascial structures, although they can also appear at extra-abdominal sites. The most common extra-abdominal locations include the shoulder, chest wall, back, thigh, and head and neck. In children, desmoid tumors are more infiltrative, having a tendency towards osseous involvement more frequently than in adult patients. We report acase of a supraspinatus muscle desmoid tumor in a female patient with clavicle destruction."
"Multiple studies have shown that the tumor microenvironment (TME) of carcinomas can play an important role in the initiation, progression, and metastasis of cancer. Here we test the hypothesis that specific benign fibrous soft tissue tumor gene expression profiles may represent distinct stromal fibroblastic reaction types that occur in different breast cancers. The discovered stromal profiles could classify breast cancer based on the type of stromal reaction patterns in the TME. METHODS: Next generation sequencing-based gene expression profiling (3SEQ) was performed on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples of 10 types of fibrous soft tissue tumors. We determined the extent to which these signatures could identify distinct subsets of breast cancers in four publicly available breast cancer datasets. RESULTS: A total of 53 fibrous tumors were sequenced by 3SEQ with an average of 29 million reads per sample. Both the gene signatures derived from elastofibroma (EF) and fibroma of tendon sheath (FOTS) demonstrated robust outcome results for survival in the four breast cancer datasets. The breast cancers positive for the EF signature (20-33% of the cohort) demonstrated significantly better outcome for survival. In contrast, the FOTS signature-positive breast cancers (11-35% of the cohort) had a worse outcome. CONCLUSIONS: We defined and validated two new stromal signatures in breast cancer (EF and FOTS), which are significantly associated with prognosis. Our group has previously identified novel cancer stromal gene expression signatures associated with outcome differences in breast cancer by gene expression profiling of three soft tissue tumors, desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF), solitary fibrous tumor (SFT), and tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT/CSF1), as surrogates for stromal expression patterns. By combining the stromal signatures of EF and FOTS, with our previously identified DTF and TGCT/CSF1 signatures we can now characterize clinically relevant stromal expression profiles in the TME for between 74% to 90% of all breast cancers."
"A 59-year-old male, was admitted to our hospital for a tumor of the pancreatic tail. Serum CEA and CA 19-9 levels were normal. Splenopancreasectomy found a desmoid tumour. A 69-year-old male was referred to our institution for chronic anemia and inflammatory syndrome with splenomegaly. Splenectomy showed an important splenic congestion and siderosis. Both patients had a type 2 diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, histological examination revealed pancreatic endocrine microadenomas. The two patients' postoperative course was unremarkable. Eleven and 24 months respectively after the diagnosis, the patients are alive and well, with no tumor recurrence."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is a rare locally aggressive monoclonal proliferation of myofibroblasts lacking metastatic capacity. It may be observed in nearly every part of the body. Considering the variable clinical presentations, anatomic locations, and biologic behaviors, an individualized treatment approach is required. The pathogenesis of DF is not completely understood even if a high prevalence ( approximately 85%) of CTNNB1 mutations discovered in sporadic DF underlies the importance of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. No established and evidence-based approach for the treatment of this neoplasm is available as of today. Considering the unpredictable behavior and the heterogeneity of this disease, we propose a treatment algorithm approved by the French and the Italian Sarcoma Group, based on a front-line wait and see approach and subsequent therapy in the case of progression. A careful counseling at a referral center is mandatory and should be offered to all patients affected by sporadic DF from the time of their diagnosis."
"Some intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal tumors such as low-grade slow-growing malignancies may seem unresectable due to major vessel encasement or presence of intra-abdominal dissemination, but the slow growth rate and to some extent long life expectancy of the patients urge us to find some strategies to cure the patients or at least achieve tumor remission or symptom palliation. En bloc resection, followed by multivisceral or liver-sparing ""modified"" multivisceral transplantation has recently been used for treatment of these patients. RESULTS: Between May 2010 and October 2012, 3 multivisceral and 3 modified multivisceral transplantations were performed in 6 patients (aged 14 to 55 years; mean, 32 years) with some slow growing intra-abdominal malignancies (2 neuroendocrine tumors, 2 gastrointestinal stromal tumors, 1 desmoid tumor, and 1 low-grade sarcoma). All patients survived the procedure. One patient died of pancytopenia 2 months after transplantation and another died with pulmonary emboli at 4 months. The remaining 4 patients are alive without any evidence of disease recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Although large intra-abdominal desmoid tumors, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors are slow growing, they tend to invade locally, especially to the mesenteric root and/or celiac axis and other abdominal viscera. Complete resection followed by multivisceral transplantation could be a therapeutic option for these advanced tumors."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a broad group of rare disorders that originate from musculoaponeurotic structures. They represent less than 0,1% off all tumors and the annual incidence is 2-4 cases per million, with two peaks between 6 and 15 years of age and between puberty and age 40. They are rare in the oral and maxillofacial regions. Its pathogenesis is multifactorial. The treatment is still mainly represented, both in children and adults, by surgical excision. CASE REPORT: A case is reported of a 8-year- old girl with desmoid fibroma in the mandible who presented at the Department of Pediatric Dentistry with a swelling measuring 4x4 cm on the lower edge of the right mandible which had appeared a few months earlier and slowly developed. The family dentist had initially diagnosed it as an odontogenic abscess from the lower right deciduous molars, but the antibiotic therapy was unsuccessful. After x-ray examination, which showed a large osteolytic lesion, mandibular CT revealed a solid expanding mass. The child was referred to the Department of Paediatric Maxillofacial Surgery where the whole mass was surgically removed. At the 2-year follow-up no relapse was noted. CONCLUSION: This case stresses the importance, especially for paediatric dentists, of further diagnostic steps if suspect lesions do not heal after conventional treatment."
"Turcot syndrome is a rare inherited condition of colonic polyposis associated with central nervous system tumors. We report a patient with a novel adenomatous polyposis coli gene mutation leading to a severe phenotype including medulloblastoma, low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma following cranial radiation, pilomatrixomas, colonic adenomas, and abdominal desmoid tumor following colectomy, all of which were successfully treated. Multiple tumors may be seen in patients with Turcot syndrome but the occurrence of sarcomas is rare. This case highlights the importance of close follow-up for patients with Turcot syndrome and the importance of a broad differential diagnosis in evaluating a condition in which multiple tumors are frequently seen."
"Granular cell tumors (GCT's) are uncommon soft tissue neoplasms most likely of neural or neuroectodermal origin. They can be found in virtually any body site, but they are rarely located in the abdominal wall. We report the case of a patient with a history of breast cancer presenting with a slow-growing, firm and painless nodule in the abdominal wall. After ruling out metastatic origin of the mass by CT scan and MRI, an incisional biopsy was performed. Anatomopathologic findings were congruent with a benign granular cell tumor of the abdominal wall. En-bloc surgical resection with reconstruction of the abdominal wall defect using a prosthetic mesh was performed. Preoperative histopathologic diagnosis of an abdominal wall tumor is important. Broad surgical excision to obtain negative margins should be the therapeutic goal in all cases of GCT as positive margins are highly correlated with recurrence of the lesion."
"Aggressive fibromatosis, previously referred to as desmoid tumor, is a rare tumor. It is classified as benign, however, has a high potential for local invasion and recurrence. It is most commonly found in the abdomen, with an origin in the head and neck accounting for less than a quarter of the total cases. METHODS: Literature review using PubMed and OVID and a combination of the words, ""desmoid"", ""fibromatosis"", ""pediatric"", ""children"", and ""head and neck"". RESULTS: Annual occurrence is 0.2 - 0.4 per 100,000, with origins in the head and neck accounting for 10-25%. Since 1954, 97 cases of pediatric head and neck fibromatosis were reported. The age range was from birth to 16 years, with the average being 4 years and 5 months old. The overwhelming majority of tumors were of the mandible (38%). 74% patients underwent a large resection as the primary treatment modality. The most common treatment complication was tumor recurrence (16%). CONCLUSIONS: Fibromatosis is a rare tumor of muscoloaponeurotic origin. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment; however recurrence rates are high, even despite negative surgical margins."
"Desmoid tumours/aggressive fibromatosis (DT/AF) are infrequent soft-tissue neoplasms. They usually behave as indolent diseases. However, they may grow locally infiltrating or compressing adjacent structures. The role of local treatment is limited and only a few drugs have shown activity. CASES PRESENTATION: We report the outcome of two patients affected by progressive DT/AF treated with the angiogenesis inhibitor pazopanib in two different institutions. Both patients achieved dramatic improvement in their symptoms and radiological signs of response. The clinical benefit lasted for more than 1 year and it is still ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: Pazopanib is an active treatment in DT/AF. It is the first time this has been reported."

"Desmoplastic fibroma is a rare benign primary bone tumor that is histologically similar to the soft tissue desmoid tumor. It most often involves the mandible, large long bone or iliac bone. Desmoplastic fibroma in a toe has been extremely rarely reported. Authors report a rare case of desmoplastic fibroma of bone occurring in the distal phalanx of a foot, with descriptions of the radiographic and MRI findings, correlation of the radiologic and pathologic findings, and discussion on the differential diagnosis of the tumor."
"The pattern of myometrial invasion in endometrioid endometrial carcinomas varies considerably; ie, from widely scattered glands and cell nests, often associated with a fibromyxoid stromal reaction (desmoplasia) and/or a lymphocytic infiltrate, to invasive glands with little or no stromal response. Recently, two distinct stromal signatures derived from a macrophage response (colony-stimulating factor 1, CSF1) and a fibroblastic response (desmoid-type fibromatosis, DTF) were identified in breast carcinomas and correlated with clinicopathologic features including outcome. In this study, we explored whether these stromal signatures also apply to endometrioid carcinomas and how their expression patterns correlated with morphologic changes. We studied the stromal signatures both by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in 98 primary endometrioid carcinomas with (87 cases) and without (11 cases) myometrial invasion as well as in the corresponding regional lymph nodes metatases of 9 myoinvasive tumors. Desmoplasia correlated positively with the DTF expression signature. Likewise, mononuclear infiltrates were found in the stroma of tumors expressing CSF1. Twenty-four out of eighty-seven (27%) myoinvasive endometrioid carcinomas were positive for the macrophage signature and thirteen out of eighty-seven (15%) expressed the fibroblast signature. Eleven additional cases were positive for both DTF and CSF1 signatures (11/87; 13%). However, over half of the cases (39/87; 45%) and the majority of the non-myoinvasive tumors (8/11; 73%) failed to express any of the two stromal signatures. The macrophage response (CSF1) was associated with higher tumor grade, lymphovascular invasion, and PIK3CA mutations (P<0.05). There was a concordance in the expression of the CSF1 signature in the primary tumors and their corresponding lymph node metastases. This study is the first characterization of stromal signatures in endometrioid carcinomas. Our findings shed new light on the relationship between genetically different endometrioid carcinomas and various stromal responses. Preservation of the CSF1 macrophage stromal response in the metastases leds support to targeting the CSF1 pathway in endometrioid endometrial carcinomas."
"The enamel-renal syndrome of amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) and nephrocalcinosis, and the amelogenesis imperfecta-gingival fibromatosis syndrome have both been associated with mutations in FAM20A. We report on two unrelated Thai patients with three novel and one previously reported mutations in FAM20A with findings suggesting both disorders, including hypoplastic AI, gingival fibromatosis, unerupted teeth, aggressive periodontitis, and nephrocalcinosis/nephrolithiasis. Additional findings consisted of a supernumerary premolar, localized aggressive periodontitis, thin alveolar bone, vitamin D deficiency-associated hyperparathyroidism, and heterotopic calcification in other tissues, including lungs, dental pulp, gingiva, dental follicles, and periodontal tissues, and early cessation of limited menstruation. Greater promotory activity of urine on calcium oxalate crystal growth compared to controls may help to explain the pathogenesis, and suggest that FAM20A mutations can contribute to nephrocalcinosis/nephrolithiasis. Our findings expand the phenotypic spectrum of FAM20A mutations. Since both of our patients and a large number of previously reported cases had all the important features of both syndromes, including AI, renal anomalies, and gingival fibromatosis, we are convinced that these two disorders actually are the same entity. The name of enamel-renal-gingival syndrome is suggested."
"Sarcomas are rare and heterogeneous with many subtypes explaining the high level of diagnostic difficulty with frequent important therapeutic consequences. In 2009, a national network of pathologists has been set up with the main objective to perform a systematic histological review of every new sarcoma, gastro-intestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and desmoid tumor. We describe the network organization and report the results of the first two years of activity. These results clearly show the interest of this organization for the patients as well as for all pathologists. Moreover, data and material collect allows a better knowledge of these tumors and an improvement of the rules for their diagnostic management."
"Desmoplastic fibroma (DF) of the bone is a rare locally aggressive tumor usually occurring in adolescents and young adults. These tumors most commonly occur in the mandibles and metaphyses of long bones but are extremely rare in small bones, often resulting in diagnostic problems. The occurrence of these tumors in the foot is especially limited. We report the clinical, radiographic, and histologic features of DF arising in the distal phalanx of the great toe and a review of the published data."
"Fibromatosis or desmoid tumour of the breast is an extremely rare, locally aggressive tumour with a tendency to relapse. Nevertheless these tumours do not have metastatic potential. Early recognition and wide local excision of the tumour is the treatment of choice. We present a case of a desmoid tumour of the breast in a 67-year-old woman and provide a review of the literature."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (desmoid) is a locally aggressive (myo)fibroblastic lesion. It represents one of the more common fibrous tumours in children and adolescents. The head and neck region is more often involved than in adults. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated the clinicopathological and genetic characteristics of seven paediatric desmoids at this anatomical site, including two cases of desmoplastic fibroma located in the mandible. There were two females and five males with an age range of 1.5-8 years. The sites of the soft tissue lesions were sinonasal (n = 4) and paramandibular (n = 1). All cases showed typical morphology and nuclear beta-catenin expression. CTNNB1 gene sequencing, performed successfully in five cases, revealed mutations in three cases with one p.T41A (bone lesion), one p.S37A and one novel mutation, p.D32V (sinonasal soft tissue lesions). Six patients were treated by excision with positive margins in five cases. Follow-up, available for six patients (median 4 years), showed no evidence of disease in four cases, slow progression in one case, and recurrence with stable disease in the last case. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence of genetic similarities in desmoid and desmoplastic fibroma. Additionally, we expanded the spectrum of mutations in CTNNB1 with one novel desmoid mutation."

"Desmoid tumours are rare mesenchymal tumours, often locally invasive and characteristically associated with a high local recurrence rate after resection. A potential aetiological role for female hormones is indicated. Pregnancy-associated desmoid tumours are almost exclusively located in the abdominal wall. An essential issue is how to counsel women who have had a pregnancy-associated desmoid tumour and subsequently wish to bear a child. A considerably rare case of a patient with a resection of a giant pregnancy-associated, 33 cm in diameter, intra-abdominal desmoid tumour is presented. After a subsequent pregnancy, the patient delivered healthy twins 26 months later. Fifty-four months after treatment, there are no signs of recurrent or second desmoid tumour. Although rarely located in the abdomen, pregnancy-associated desmoid tumours should be included in the differential diagnosis of intra-abdominal tumours detected during or shortly after pregnancy. Based on this case and a few others reported in the literature, subsequent pregnancy does not necessarily seem to be a risk factor for recurrent or new disease."
"This case reports a unique presentation of two different clinical entities amidst few similarities and differences. Usually, aggressive periodontitis and gingival fibromatosis occur independently. Their simultaneous occurrence is rarely found. This report deals with the clinical features and management aspect of such a case."
"Prognostic factors and optimal management of desmoid tumors have been discussed for decades. The authors present the results of a large series of patients with desmoid tumors treated at a single institution to investigate the prognostic factors influencing event-free survival (EFS) and suitable treatments for these rare tumors. METHODS: Two hundred fourteen patients with desmoid tumors admitted to the surgical department were included, of whom 20 were recommended for a policy of watchful waiting. The following clinical parameters were studied: admission status, age, sex, tumor site, tumor size, margin status, and therapeutic strategy. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed for EFS. RESULTS: Forty-two patients had local recurrence. One patient died of intra-abdominal disease. The 5-year and 10-year EFS rates were 78.8% and 77.9%, respectively. In univariate analysis, admission status, tumor site, tumor size, and group (R0 vs R1 and R0 vs R2) had significant impacts on EFS. EFS discrepancy was not significant between R1 and R2 or biopsy groups. In multivariate analysis, tumor size and admission status had independent value. The median delay to progression for patients undergoing watchful waiting was comparable with that for the surgical group. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that tumor size and a history of recurrence are independent predictors of EFS. Surgery is warranted if it can be R0 and function sparing. Nonsurgical modalities or a policy of watchful waiting may be a better choice for unresectable disease."
"Transaxillary robotic (TAR) thyroidectomy has been performed for better aesthetic results by many surgeons. In this report, we describe a rare case of a desmoid tumor developed after TAR thyroidectomy, which is speculated to be a late-term complication. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 61-year-old woman with a history of papillary microcarcinoma had experienced a large left neck mass that had grown over 2 years. The patient underwent TAR thyroidectomy (right lobectomy and isthmectomy) via the right axilla almost 2.5 years previously. Physical examination revealed a 6-cm, firm mass fixed to the left anterior neck. The mass was fixed to the omohyoid muscle. The 5.9- x 4.7- x 4.5-cm tumor with the surrounding muscles was excised in an en bloc fashion. Pathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of a desmoid tumor. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that desmoid tumors could develop late after TAR thyroidectomy. Thus, careful observation of the surgical wound may be necessary after TAR thyroidectomy."
"Desmoid tumors are rare, clonal collections of benign fibrous tissue that exhibit a highly variable clinical course. This article presents a comprehensive review of desmoid tumors and summarizes the current literature pertaining to clinical presentation, diagnostic modalities, pathogenesis, prognostic factors, and management options."

"Notch signaling plays an important role in development and cell fate determination, and it is deregulated in human hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. This review includes a brief introduction of the relevant pathophysiology of Notch signaling pathway and primarily focuses on the clinical development of promising agents that either obstruct Notch receptor cleavages such as gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) or interfere with the Notch ligand-receptor interaction by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Antitumor activity by GSIs and mAbs administered as single agent in early phases of clinical trials has been observed in advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, intracranial tumors, sarcoma or desmoid tumors, colorectal cancer with neuroendocrine features, melanoma and ovarian cancer. A number of mechanism-based adverse events particularly gastrointestinal toxicities emerged and mitigation strategies are developed after testing multiple GSIs and Notch targeting mAbs. We also discuss pharmacodynamic biomarkers in conjunction with methods of assessment of the molecular target inhibition validation. Biomarkers of efficacy or benefit may be of importance for a successful development of this class of drugs."
"Intramuscular myxoma is a rare benign soft tissue tumor involving the musculoskeletal system. The incidence is reported as varying from 0.1 to 0.13 per 100,000 population. Most patients present between the fifth and sixth decade of life. The swelling commonly occurs in the large muscles of the thigh, shoulder, buttocks and arms. The tumor can be diagnosed with certainty only with histopathological examination. Local recurrence is rare after excision. CASE REPORT: A 73 year old male patient presented to us with a swelling of the anterior aspect of the middle third of the right thigh measuring about 8 x 4 centimeters. He was thoroughly investigated and the swelling excised in toto. The soft cystic swelling excised was found on histopathology to be an intramuscular myxoma. CONCLUSION: This case report is being presented since the tumor is rare and also an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of sarcomas, intramuscular lipoma, hemangioma, hematoma, and desmoid tumor. Another important feature is that it can be diagnosed with certainty only after excision."
"Desmoid tumor of bone is a rare benign tumor. It is reported commonly in mandibular and meta-diaphyseal region of long bones. We report involvement of unusual site in ilio-acetabular region with breach in articular cartilage. CASE REPORT: A 40 year old female presented with pain in the left hip. Radiologically, a lytic lesion at ilio-acetabular region was seen. Intra-operatively breach in acetabular roof was seen which was missed in the scan. Curettage and defect reconstruction was done. Histopathology reported as desmoid tumor. 20 months post-operatively patient was symptom free. CONCLUSION: Desmoid tumor is a rare bone tumor. This case report emphasizes about the rarity of the lesion in this location and the rare chances of breach in articular cartilage of the joint. The chances of recurrences are high with intralesional curettage."
"The relevance of the initial observational approach for desmoid tumors (DTs) remains unclear. We investigated a new conservative management treatment for primary abdominal wall DTs. METHODS: Data were collected from 147 patients between 1993 and 2012. The initial therapeutic approaches were categorized as front-line surgery [surgery group (SG), n = 41, 28 %] and initial observation or medical treatment [nonsurgery group (NSG), n = 106, 72 %]. The cumulative incidence of the last strategy modification was estimated using competing risk methods with variable censoring times. RESULTS: Of the 147 patients, 143 were female (97 %). In the SG, 27 patients (66 %) required full-thickness abdominal wall mesh repair. In the NSG, 102 patients (96 %) underwent initial observation and four received medical treatment. In the NSG, the 1- and 3-year incidences of changing to medical treatment (no further changes during the follow-up) were 19 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 11-28] and 25 % (95 % CI 17-35), respectively, and the 1- and 3-year incidences of a final switch to surgery were 14 % (95 % CI 8-22) and 16 % (95 % CI 9-24), respectively. An initial tumor size of >7 cm was associated with a higher strategy modification risk (p = 0.004). Of the 102 patients initially observed, 29 experienced spontaneous regression over a median follow-up period of 32 months. All second-intent resections were macroscopically completed, with R0 resections achieved in 82 % of patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports an initial nonsurgical approach to abdominal wall DTs </=7 cm, followed by surgery based on tumor growth in select cases."
"Desmoid fibromatosis is classified as a benign soft tissue tumor regardless of its local invasive behavior and its, local recurrence rate is 57-85% after local resection. A 19 y/o male patient with post-operative recurrence of a desmoid tumor in the shoulder was initially treated by arterial embolization; however, no improvement of symptoms was obtained. As second-line treatment, 20 mg of epirubicin, 50 mg of cisplatin and 250 mg of 5-FU were infused to tumor-related arteries and embolization was performed with a super absorbent polymer microsphere. After a single session of treatment, reduction of tumor size and improvement of symptoms were achieved. The same treatment was repeated three times without major complications. Considerable reduction of tumor was obtained after treatment. Chemo-embolization should be considered for the postoperative recurrence of desmoid fibromatosis, in order to prevent loss of function and maintain a high QOL for the patient."
"Desmoid type fibromatosis is a benign fibroblastic tumor arising from the fascia or musculoaponeurosis. It may occur in various locations, but most commonly in the shoulder girdle and neck; to our knowledge, there has been no reported case originating from a facet joint of the spine. We report CT and MR imaging findings of a desmoid type fibromatosis, involving the facet joint of the L3-4 spine with bone involvement."
"An abdominal mass is a common clinical presentation, and a small percentage of such patients will have an abdominal wall tumour with the two most common pathologies being fibromatosis and soft tissue sarcoma. METHODS: Here we present the available literature on the diagnosis and management of both fibromatosis and soft tissue sarcoma, in the context of our experience in a tertiary referral centre for sarcoma. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Appropriate cross-sectional imaging and a pre-operative tissue diagnosis by percutaneous core biopsy are necessary to define management. Desmoid fibromatosis can be managed initially by observation with serial imaging, with surgery being reserved for those patients who demonstrate progression. Soft tissue sarcoma can display a range of pathologies from relatively indolent tumours to locally aggressive sarcomas that can readily metastasise. An accurate pre-operative histological diagnosis and staging enables a multidisciplinary approach to management. This may include chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but the mainstay of treatment remains wide surgical resection and abdominal wall reconstruction. Patient outcomes are worse if referral is delayed or if the sarcoma is incompletely resected without an initial tissue diagnosis."
"To describe a difficult case of a large extra-abdominal desmoid fibroma of the posterior neck and back; to discuss the pathologic findings and treatment options of this case and to review the current literature for a rare presentation of this disease. METHOD: A case report and review of the current relevant English literature, carried out using PubMed Medline, are presented. RESULTS: We present a challenging case in which a locally invasive desmoid of the posterior neck and back had grown to such an extent that complete surgical excision in one procedure was not possible. CONCLUSION: Extra-abdominal desmoid fibromas are rare tumors with multiple treatment options. The literature supports incomplete surgical resection when necessary to reduce postoperative morbidity. Further options described for residual or recurrent disease include repeat surgical excision, radiation therapy, and possible chemotherapy. For particularly large tumors, close observation and a planned second stage procedure are an appropriate choice."
"Extra-abdominal periosteal desmoid tumors are uncommon nonmetastatic tumors of the extremities with a propensity for local recurrence. Lesions in the distal extremities are rare; a majority of extra-abdominal lesions occur in more proximal portions of the upper and lower extremities. This article reports a patient with an extra-abdominal periosteal desmoid tumor in the toe. A 37-year-old woman had a mass in her left third distal phalanx that was originally noted 3 years prior to presenting to the authors' institution. She reported the mass expanded during pregnancy. The toe was red and elongated and had expanded to approximately the same size as her great toe. The plantar aspect of the toe was thick and callused, and the toenail was slightly elevated. Marginal excision with retention of the nail was performed without complication. The mass was determined to be an extra-abdominal periosteal desmoid tumor and was successfully removed without recurrence. To date, the patient remains asymptomatic, with no pain and complete sensation in her third toe. Although extra-abdominal periosteal desmoid tumors have been identified in the extremities, to the authors' knowledge none have been reported as far distal as the toe. Identifying this lesion in the distal extremity will allow a hasty diagnosis and treatment in future cases of similar presentation. Knowledge of the existence of this type of tumor in the distal extremity may also assist in narrowing differential diagnoses."
"Intra-abdominal desmoid disease is one of the most common extra-intestinal manifestations of familial adenomatous polyposis. Small bowel obstruction occurs frequently in affected patients and is notoriously difficult to treat. The aim of this study was to review the management and outcome of desmoid-related small bowel obstruction. METHOD: This was a retrospective, descriptive study of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and intra-abdominal desmoid disease who developed small bowel obstruction. Demographic data and data concerning the presentation, diagnosis and treatment of the bowel obstructions were abstracted from the polyposis database or patients' records. Patients with obstruction unrelated to desmoid disease were excluded. RESULTS: There were 47 patients (30 women and 17 men). Median age at first bowel obstruction was 24.2 (interquartile range 19.2-34.2) years. The median time from index surgery to first bowel obstruction was 4.1 (interquartile range 1.5-9.0) years. Twenty-two patients had a colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis and 21 a proctocolectomy and ileoanal pouch. Obstruction was treated medically in 29% of cases and surgically in 69%. Thirteen patients had total parental nutrition. Thirty (63.8%) had a second episode of small bowel obstruction at a mean of 5.3 years after the first, 50% of which were treated medically. Eighteen (37.5%) patients had more than two episodes of bowel obstruction. There were 118 operations, including lysis of adhesions (29), small bowel resection (14), bypass (12), ileostomy (12), desmoid excision (9) and stricturoplasty (2). CONCLUSION: Desmoid-related small bowel obstruction in familial adenomatous polyposis patients requires multiple surgical strategies to restore a patent gastrointestinal tract. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO THE LITERATURE?: This is the only series in the literature specifically addressing small bowel obstruction in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and intra-abdominal desmoid disease. The data show that small bowel obstruction is common, tends to recur, but can be successfully managed by a combination of medical and well selected surgical treatment."
"Desmoid tumors or aggressive fibromatoses are rare, non-encapsulated, infiltrative and locally aggressive tumors originating from deep musculo-aponeurotic structures. Traditionally, preferred treatment method for desmoid tumors is wide local excision. Depending on the side and type of resection, the reported local recurrence rates range from 15 to 77%. Similarly, in our institution there is a significant recurrence rate (24%) in patients who underwent surgery for desmoid tumor. After several recurrences, amputation may be inevitable following repeating vascular and nerve reconstructions. There is a need for a nonviable barrier in order to prevent the invasion of the viable tumor to the neurovascular structures which are also viable tissues. Depending on this need, we present two cases that we used synthetic vascular graft in their operations to cover neurovascular structures in order to prevent tumor invasion. For patients who are not suitable for radiotherapy and the neurovascular structures need to be secured because of the risk of local recurrence, this method can prevent possible future invasion of vessels and nerves."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a rare neoplasm arising from musculoaponeurotic structures. Our aim is to share our experience with this rare tumor in our institute and to discuss the more perplexing recurrence patterns and the management options. This is a retrospective study of the disease, treated in our institute for the past fourteen years. A total of 36 patients were analyzed. The demographic pattern of the disease, various treatment modalities offered and their outcome along with patterns of recurrence were studied. Our study showed a demographic pattern mostly similar to the rest of the world. But the pattern of recurrence and the multicentric and the non-random pattern of presentation observed in our study showed some difference from the other studies. We suggest surgery as the primary modality with radiation reserved for select patients with margin positivity, inoperable tumors, and multiple tumors. Since the disease has a long natural history a wait and watch policy can be observed for giving adjuvant RT. There is need for prospective multi-institutional RCTs to shed light on the unknown facts about this disease."
"Mutations in the gene-encoding beta-catenin, CTNNB1, are highly prevalent in sporadic desmoid tumors and may predict the risk for recurrence. We sought to determine the prevalence of CTNNB1 mutations in a large cohort of sporadic desmoid tumors and to determine whether CTNNB1 mutation status correlates with disease outcome. METHODS: Single-base extension genotyping of the CTNNB1 gene was performed on 145 sporadic, paraffin-embedded desmoid tumor specimens. Correlation of mutation status with outcome was performed on a subset of 115 patients who underwent macroscopically complete surgical resection. RESULTS: CTNNB1 mutations were detected in 106 of 145 (73%) tumor specimens and in 86 of 115 (75%) specimens from patients who underwent curative-intent surgical resection, including discrete mutations in the following codons of CTNNB1 exon 3: T41A (46%), S45F (25%), S45P (1.7%), and S45C (0.9%). Desmoid tumors of the superficial trunk were significantly less likely to harbor CTNNB1 mutations than tumors located elsewhere, but none of the other examined clinicopathologic factors were found to be associated with CTNNB1 mutation status. At a median follow-up of 31 months, 5-year recurrence-free survival was slightly, although not statistically significantly, worse for patients with beta-catenin-mutated tumors than for those with wild-type tumors (58% vs. 74%, respectively). The specific CTNNB1 codon mutation did not correlate with the risk for recurrence. CONCLUSION: CTNNB1 mutations are indeed common in sporadic desmoid tumors. However, our study did not detect a statistically significant difference in recurrence risk according to either the CTNNB1 mutation status or the specific CTNNB1 mutation."
"Desmoid tumors are benign fibroblastic neoplasms with no metastatic potential, but a propensity for local recurrence even after complete surgical resection. These lesions can develop at any site in the body, and commonly occur in the intra-abdominal area. Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors usually occur at the mesentery or retroperitoneum, and may morphologically mimic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Distinguishing between these tumors is important, because the therapies differ substantially, but is often difficult even with the use of CD117 staining. We herein report the cases of two patients with sporadic intra-abdominal desmoid tumors that were differentiated from GIST by immunohistological examination using beta-catenin and CD34. Desmoid tumors specifically express nuclear beta-catenin, and show no expression of CD34. We recommend staining for beta-catenin and CD34 when an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor is suspected."

"A role for the serine to phenylalanine substitution at codon 45 (the S45F mutation) in the catenin (cadherin-associated protein) beta-1 (CTNNB1) gene as a molecular predictor of local recurrence in patients with primary, sporadic desmoid tumor (DT) has been reported. To confirm the previous data, the authors evaluated the correlation between CTNNB1 mutation type and local recurrence in this multi-institutional, retrospective study. METHODS: Patients with primary, sporadic DT who underwent macroscopic complete surgical resection were included. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) analyses were conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests to compare strata. RESULTS: In total, 179 patients were identified, including 65% females and 35% males (median age, 39 years; median tumor size, 7 cm). Most DTs were located in the abdominal/chest wall (42%) followed by extra-abdominal sites (40%) and intra-abdominal sites (18%). All patients underwent either R0 resection (62%) or R1 resection (38%), and most underwent surgery alone (80%). The tyrosine to alanine substitution at codon 41 (T41A) was the most frequent mutation (45%), but the S45F mutation was more prevalent in extra-abdominal DTs compared with other sites (P< .001). At a median follow-up of 50 months, 86% of patients remained alive without disease. The estimated 3-year and 5-year RFS rates were 0.49 and 0.45, respectively, for patients who had tumors with the S45F mutation; 0.91 and 0.91, respectively, for patients who had wild-type tumors; and 0.70 and 0.66, respectively, for all others (P< .001). A similar trend was observed for patients who underwent surgery alone (P< .001). On multivariable analysis, mutation remained the only factor that was prognostic for local recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: This series confirmed that primary, completely resected, sporadic DTs with the S45F mutation have a greater tendency for local recurrence. With increasing implementation of ""watchful-waiting"" for DT management, it will be important to determine whether mutation type predicts outcome for these patients."

"Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) of the chest wall is uncommon, and our knowledge is limited to small, single institutional case series. Although some series have examined prognostic factors for survival with this rare set of neoplasms, our knowledge of the patterns of relapse is limited. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of consecutive patients treated for STS of the chest wall. Predictors of survival and recurrence were analyzed using Cox and competing-risk regression analyses. RESULTS: From 1989 to 2011, 192 patients underwent resection for STS of the chest wall. The most common histopathologic type was desmoid (33 [17%]), followed by undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (32 [16%]), liposarcoma (22 [11%]), and myxofibrosarcoma (22 [11%]). The median follow-up was 50.9 months. The 5- and 10-year survival rates were 73% and 61%, respectively. Recurrences occurred in 45 patients (23%): 17 developed local recurrences, and 28 developed distant recurrences. Among the patients who developed recurrences, the median time to event was 11.6 months for local recurrences and 13.5 months for distant recurrences. The most common histologic type among recurrences was undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (n = 12), and the most common site of distant recurrences was lung (n = 18). The primary treatment modality for both local and distant recurrences was surgical resection; median survival after recurrence was 19.4 months. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrences of STS are common after surgical resection. Although local or distant recurrences can occur soon after surgery, both can often be treated with resection, producing reasonable outcomes."
"To determine the activity of radiotherapy in patients with inoperable desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) a multicenter prospective phase II trial was carried out. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with inoperable progressive disease of primary, recurrent or incompletely resected lesions received a dose of 56 Gy in 28 fractions. Follow-up MRI studies were carried out every 3 months for 2 years and thereafter every 6 months. The primary end point was local control rate at 3 years, estimated by a nonparametric method for interval-censored survival data. Secondary end points were objective tumor response, acute and late toxic effect. RESULTS: Forty-four patients (27 F/17 M) were enrolled from 2001 to 2008. Median age was 39.5 years. Main tumor sites included trunk 15 (34.1%) and extremities 27 (61.3%). Median follow-up was 4.8 years. The 3-year local control rate was 81.5% (90% one-sided confidence interval 74% to 100%). Best overall response during the first 3 years was complete response (CR) 6 (13.6%), partial response (PR) 16 (36.4%), stable disease 18 (40.9%), progressive disease 3 (6.8%) and nonassessable 1 (2.3%). Five patients developed new lesions. After 3 years, the response further improved in three patients: (CR 2, PR 1). Acute grade 3 side-effects were limited to skin, mucosal membranes and pain. Late toxic effect consisted of mild edema in 10 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate dose radiotherapy is an effective treatment of patients with DF. Response after radiation therapy is slow with continuing regression seen even after 3 years."
"Desmoid tumors are rare benign tumors that originates in the fibrous sheath or musculo-aponeurotic structure. Histologically benign, they tends to invade locally and to be recurrent. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a rare case of an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor in a patient affected by familial adenomatous polyposis, which degenerated into abscess. Male, 38 years, was hospitalized for abdominal pain, bowel obstruction and fever. The computed tomography showed a big dishomogeneous mass occupying the whole mesentery with internal massive liquefaction. The mass extended from the epigastrium for 13cm up to L3. On the right mesogastric side a solid, thick mass of about 2cm, with a length of 4.5cm, was identified; it was not cleavable from the wall and from some of the loops. We decided to perform a computed tomography-guided percutaneous drainage. Two hundred ml of purulent necrotic material was aspirated, and washing with antibiotic solution was carried out. Cytological examination of fluid drainage showed histiocytes and neutrophils. At follow-up, the patient's clinical condition had improved. An abdominal ultrasound showed a substantial reduction in the diameter of the mass. DISCUSSION: Diagnosis and treatment of desmoids tumor in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis may be difficult, especially when desmoids are located intra-abdominally and in the mesentery. Seldom will desmoid tumors be complicated by abscess formation. CONCLUSION: The management of desmoids tumors is not easy and the choice of the best treatment may be difficult due to the different possible anatomical presentations."
"This brief clinical study presents a case of a 2-year-old girl with a submandibular mass that caused erosion of the inferior border of the mandible. An incisional biopsy finding revealed juvenile fibromatosis, that is, a group of fibrous proliferations that have biologic behavior and histopathologic pattern intermediate between those of benign fibrous lesions and fibrosarcoma. These lesions should be treated through wide surgical excision, and patients should be kept under regular follow-up because of their high recurrence rate."
"Pediatric desmoid tumors (PDTs) represent a group of rare, distinct lesions. While sparse, available literature suggests that PDT are particularly aggressive and difficult to control when compared with their adult counterpart. METHODS: A retrospective review identified 39 patients who underwent treatment of PDT at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital over a 12-year period. Clinicopathologic and treatment characteristics were analyzed to identify predictors of outcome. RESULT: A total of 39 patients were treated during the study period, with a total number of 67 resections. Median age was 12.2 years; 49 % of patients were male, and 51 % were female. Median tumor size was 9.8 cm. PDT most commonly arose in the extremities (40 %), thorax (23 %), head and neck (21 %), and trunk (16 %). Also, 18 % of resections had negative margins (R0), 48 % were microscopic positive (R1), and 30 % were macroscopic positive (R2). The 1- and 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 97.1 and 73.1 %, respectively. Factors associated with worse RFS were patient age >12 years (HR = 5.08, p = 0.038) and tumor size >5 cm (HR = 1.22, p = 0.0597). Margin status did not affect RFS. Selective use of radiation therapy appeared to improve RFS. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that margin status alone at the time of extirpation is not a predictor of ultimate cure or likelihood of recurrence. Many patients received adjuvant therapy, with benefits suggested after analysis. For patients with PDT, surgical extirpation should not come at the expense of functional preservation, as overall survival is excellent."
"Reconstruction of extensive abdominal wall defects is a challenge for reconstructive surgeons. In this report, a case of reconstruction of a large abdominal wall defect using an eccentric perforator-based pedicled anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap is presented. A 30-year-old man presented with recurrent desmoid-type fibromatosis in the abdominal wall. The recurrent tumor was radically excised, and the en bloc excision resulted in a full-thickness, large abdominal wall defect (25 cm x 20 cm). An eccentric perforator-based pedicled ALT flap, including wide fascial extension, was transferred to the abdominal defect; fascial portions were sutured to the remnant abdominal fascia. Plication of the fascia along the sutured portion was performed to relieve the skin tension between the flap and the marginal skin of the abdominal defect. Eight months after surgery, the reconstructed abdomen had an acceptable esthetic appearance without tumor recurrence or hernia. The use of an eccentric perforator-based pedicled ALT flap may be an alternative method for the reconstruction of extensive abdominal wall defects."
"Desmoid tumors (DTs) are rare lesions that do not possess any metastatic potential. However, they have a strong tendency to invade locally and recur. They constitute 3% of all soft tissue tumors and 0.03% of all neoplasms. Abdominal DTs occur sporadically or are associated with certain familial syndromes, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). The single form of this neoplasm most frequently occurs in females of reproductive age and during pregnancy. A female patient with a DT of the abdominal wall who had no relevant family history was admitted to hospital. The patient, who presented with a painless mass in the left anterolateral abdomen, had no history of trauma, surgery or childbearing. According to the medical history, physical examination and CT report, the patient was diagnosed with DT. Radical resection of the affected abdominal wall musculature was performed, and the defect was replaced with a polypropylene mesh. The histological diagnosis was of DT. The patient remains in good health and complete remission without any other treatment following surgery. DTs exhibit aggressive growth and have a high rate of recurrence. Surgery is the optimal treatment, and subsequent radiotherapy may decrease the local recurrence rate. Further research into their aetiology is required combined with multicentre clinical trials of new treatments in order to improve management of this disease. This case report provides general knowledge of DT, and may be used as a guidance for diagnosis and treatment."
"Turcot's syndrome is a rare clinical syndrome, characterized by the association between familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and a primary central nervous system tumour. Gardner's syndrome is characterized by the association between FAP and several tumour types such as multiple osteomas, fibromas, epidermoid cysts and desmoid tumours. We report here the case of a twenty-six year-old woman with a history of both Turcot's and Gardner syndromes. She had a family history of adenomatous polyposis with a mutation in the APC (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli) gene. At the age of 26, she presented a mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the right parotid gland in which the MECT1-MAML2 fusion was showed. We discuss the possible addition of this latter cancer type in the definition of Gardner's syndrome."
"Soft tissue masses in children are common, yet can pose a diagnostic dilemma for the orthopedic surgeon who is asked to evaluate them. Although most lesions are dysplastic or benign, some soft tissue sarcomas are seen in the pediatric population. An understanding of the clinical presentation and imaging findings can guide the surgeon decide on the need for a biopsy and formulate an appropriate treatment plan."
"Enterocutaneous fistula is a severe complication of intra-abdominal desmoid disease. It is hard to repair because of the presence of the desmoid itself, the possibility of distal obstruction and the complexity of multiple laparotomies. Here we report the outcome of a series of patients presenting with abdominal desmoid disease and associated enterocutaneous fistula. METHOD: This is a retrospective, descriptive study of patients presenting to a hereditary colorectal cancer registry with familial adenomatous polyposis-related intra-abdominal desmoid disease and associated enterocutaneous fistulae. Patients were identified through the registry database and aspects of their treatment and outcome were abstracted. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (11 women, five men) were treated. The mean age at index surgery was 25.2 years and mean time to first fistula was 115.6 (+/- 92.7 standard deviation) months from index surgery. Index surgery included restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch (n = 9), colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (n = 4) and proctocolectomy with end ileostomy (n = 1). One patient had only a small bowel bypass and another did not have any index surgery. Ten patients underwent laparotomy for the enterocutaneous fistula; eight had a repair +/- resection, one had a diversion and one a bypass. All eight patients who had a repair healed, and the bypassed fistula was successfully palliated. Three fistulae recurred and two were successfully repaired at a second procedure. One patient was explored but nothing could be done for the fistula. Two surgery patients died of causes unrelated to the fistula. Six patients received medical treatment, four of whom died. CONCLUSION: Selected desmoid-related enterocutaneous fistulae can be repaired successfully."
"The propensity of desmoid tumors to develop in scars has led some surgeons to limit the complexity of desmoid defect reconstruction as a strategy for avoiding desmoid recurrence. We hypothesized that desmoid recurrence rates are similar despite the magnitude of reconstruction. STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively compared recurrence rates between patients who underwent reconstruction and patients who underwent primary closure without reconstruction after desmoid tumor resection in consecutive patients for 15 years. Univariate and multivariate regression analyzed associations between patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics and outcomes. RESULTS: We included 164 consecutive patients (80 [49%] reconstructions vs 84 [51%] primary closures). Mean follow-up duration was 7.1 +/- 4.5 years. Patients who underwent reconstruction had more desmoids in an area of earlier trauma or surgery (p < 0.001), greater defect volume (p < 0.01), longer operative time (p < 0.001) and hospital stay (p < 0.001), and more postoperative complications (p = 0.015) compared with the primary closure group. Despite these differences, desmoid recurrence rates were similar for the reconstruction and primary closure groups (30% and 29%, respectively; p = 0.7), as was mean time to tumor recurrence, and no tumors recurred within flap donor sites. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated the 45F mutation to be the only independent predictor of recurrence (hazard ratio = 1.87; p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Rates of desmoid recurrence in resection defects are similar for primary closures and complex reconstructions. Therefore, surgeons should not limit the magnitude of reconstructions in an attempt to avoid tumor recurrence. However, given the propensity of desmoids to recur, reconstructions should allow for the possibility of future resections and reconstructions, particularly in tumors with 45F gene mutations."
"Desmoid tumor (also called aggressive fibromatosis) is a lesion of mesenchymal origin that can occur as a sporadic tumor or a manifestation of the preneoplastic syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis caused by a mutation in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). This tumor type is characterized by the stabilization of beta-catenin and activation of Tcf-mediated transcription. Cell transplantation data suggest that desmoid tumors are derived from mesenchymal progenitor cells (MSCs). As such, modulating cell signaling pathways that regulate MSC differentiation or proliferation, such as hedgehog (Hh) signaling, could alter the tumor phenotype. Here, we found that Hh signaling is activated in human and murine desmoid tumors. Inhibiting Hh signaling in human cell cultures decreased cell proliferation and beta-catenin protein levels. Apc(+)/Apc(1638N) mice, which develop desmoid tumors, develop smaller and fewer tumors when Hh signaling was inhibited either genetically (by crossing Apc(+)/Apc(1638N) mice with mice lacking one copy of a Hh-activated transcription factor, Gli2 (+/-) mice) or using a pharmacologic inhibitor. Both in mice and in human tumor cell cultures, beta-catenin and Hh-mediated signaling positively regulate each other's activity. These data show that targeting a pathway that regulates MSC differentiation influences desmoid tumor behavior, providing functional evidence supporting the notion that these tumors are derived from mesenchymal progenitors. It also suggests Hh blockade as a therapeutic approach for this tumor type."
"A 50-year-old man presented with a 5-month history of swelling over the right side of neck. The swelling was associated with dull aching pain radiating to the forearm without associated weakness of upper extremity or sensory loss. There was no history of trauma. On examination a fixed mass approximately 8x6 cm in size, smooth, firm in consistency, with ill-defined margins was present in the right posterior triangle. MRI scan of the neck revealed well-defined, lobulated, heterogeneously enhancing altered signal intensity mass at the root of neck. Debulking of the tumour was performed in view of its close proximity to the brachial plexus. Histopathology revealed aggressive fibromatosis (AF). AF is a benign fibrous neoplasm arising from fascia, periosteum and musculoaponeurotic structures of the body. AF in the head and neck region tends to be locally aggressive with a nature to invade bone and soft tissue structures."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a locally aggressive fibroblastic neoplasm with a tendency for local recurrence, despite adequate surgical resection. Its clinical presentation, biological behavior, and natural history can vary considerably. We present a unique case of desmoid-type fibromatosis arising in the left teres major muscle of a 62-year-old female. Physical examination showed a 7-cm, elastic-hard, immobile, tender mass. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a partially ill-defined mass, with intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted sequences and heterogenous high signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences. Contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted sequences demonstrated intense and homogenous enhancement throughout the mass. Integrated positron-emission tomographic (PET)/computed tomographic (CT) images showed moderate focal (1)(8)F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake corresponding to the clinically palpable and MRI-described soft tissue mass, with a maximal standardized uptake value of 4.85. The possibility of a malignant lesion was raised. Following an open biopsy, wide resection of the tumor was performed. Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of desmoid-type fibromatosis. Finally, we discuss the imaging features of this peculiar neoplasm on MRI and PET/CT."

"We have previously characterized a tumor stroma expression signature in a subset of breast tumors that correlates with better clinical outcome. The purpose of this study is to determine whether this stromal signature, termed the ""DTF fibroblast"" (desmoid-type fibromatosis) signature, is specific to breast cancer or is a common stromal response found in different types of cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS: The DTF fibroblast signature was applied to gene expression profiles from five ovarian, five lung, two colon, and three prostate cancer expression microarray datasets. In addition, two different tissue microarrays of 204 ovarian tumors and 140 colon tumors were examined for the expression of previously characterized protein markers of DTF fibroblast signature. The DTF fibroblast stromal response was then correlated with clinicopathologic features. RESULTS: The DTF fibroblast signature is robustly present in ovarian, lung, and colon carcinomas. Both expression microarray data and immunohistochemistry show that the subset of ovarian tumors with strong DTF fibroblast signature expression has statistically significant, worse survival outcomes. No reproducible survival differences were found in either the lung or the colon cancers. The prostate cancers failed to show a DTF fibroblast signature. Multivariant analysis showed that DTF fibroblast signature was significantly more prognostic than the proliferation status in ovarian carcinomas. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the DTF fibroblast signature is a common tumor stroma signature in different types of cancer, including ovarian, lung, and colon carcinomas. Our findings provide further insight into the DTF fibroblast stromal responses across different types of carcinomas and their potential as prognostic and therapeutic targets."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a locally aggressive soft tissue tumour with a biological behaviour that varies between relatively indolent and progressive growth. Although there is a trend towards conservative treatment, surgery remains the standard treatment for extra-abdominal desmoid tumours. METHODS: Databases of three hospitals were searched to identify patients who had been treated for desmoid-type fibromatosis between November 1989 and May 2011. The risk of local recurrence was evaluated and predictive factors were assessed in patients who underwent surgical resection as initial treatment for a primary tumour. RESULTS: A total of 132 patients had surgical treatment for a primary tumour. A complete resection (R0) was achieved in 87 patients (65.9 per cent). In addition to surgery, 54 patients received radiotherapy. During a median follow-up of 38 months, 18 local recurrences were detected. The estimated 5-year cumulative risk of local recurrence was 17.6 per cent. Univariable Cox regression analysis demonstrated that the risk of local recurrence increased for extremity lesions compared with desmoids on the trunk (odds ratio 6.69, 95 per cent confidence interval 1.42 to 31.54). No significant influence of age, resection margins or adjuvant radiotherapy on the risk for local recurrence was observed. CONCLUSION: Following surgical treatment of a primary extra-abdominal desmoid tumour, the 5-year risk of local recurrence is modest and not influenced by microscopically clear resection margins or adjuvant radiotherapy."
Lipomatosis of nerve is a rare benign tumor-like process characterized by infiltration of the epineurium by adipose and fibrous tissue leading to nerve enlargement. We describe a case of lipomatosis of the sciatic nerve compressed by an adjacent desmoid tumor. This case supports the hypothesis that lipomatosis of nerve may form as a result of irritation or compression by adjacent structures.
"Desmoid tumours of the extremity have a high recurrence rate. The purpose of this study was to analyse the outcome after resection of these tumours with special emphasis on recurrent disease and adjuvant therapeutic strategies. METHODS: In this retrospective study we evaluated prognostic factors for recurrence-free survival after surgical treatment of desmoid tumours of the extremity in 27 patients with an average age of 41 years treated from 1997 to 2009. Adjuvant radiotherapy (50-60 Gy) was given in five cases with primary and in nine patients with recurrent disease. The average follow-up was 64 months. RESULTS: The five-year recurrence-free survival in patients with primary disease was 33%. Patients with negative resection margins tended to have a better outcome than patients with positive resection margins, but the difference between both groups was not significant (56 vs 14%, p = 0.145). In patients with positive margins, adjuvant radiotherapy did not significantly improve recurrence-free survival (40 vs 14%, p = 0.523). Patients with local recurrence had a five-year further recurrence-free survival of 47%. In those patients further recurrence-free survival was significantly better after adjuvant radiation (89 vs 25%, p = 0.015). Two thirds of all patients suffered moderate or severe complications due to the treatment regimen. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to desmoids of the trunk or the head and neck region, desmoids affecting the limbs show by far the worst outcome in terms of relapse or treatment-related morbidity. The importance of negative resection margins is still not clear. Particularly in recurrent desmoids adjuvant radiotherapy appears to reduce the further recurrence rate. Therefore, a general use of radiation should be considered for this high-risk group."
"The local control of desmoid tumors constitutes a continuing treatment dilemma due to its high recurrence rates. The purpose of this systematic review was to critically examine the current treatment of these rare tumors and to specifically evaluate the local failure and response rates of surgery, radiation and systemic therapy. We comprehensively searched the literature for relevant studies across Cinahl, Embase, Medline and the Cochrane databases. Articles were categorized as surgery, radiation, surgery + radiation and systemic therapy (including cytotoxic and non cytotoxic). Methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Pooled odd ratios (OR) for comparative studies and weighted proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported. Thirty-five articles were included in the final analysis. Weighted mean local failure rates were 22% [95% CI (16-28%)], 35% [95% CI (26-44%)] and 28% [95% CI (18-39%)] for radiation alone, surgery alone and surgery + radiation respectively. In the analysis of comparative studies, surgery and radiation in combination had lower local failure rates than radiation alone [OR 0.7 (0.4, 1.2)] and surgery alone [OR 0.7 (0.4, 1.0)]. Weighted mean stable disease rates were 91% [95% CI (85-96%)] and 52% [95% CI (38-65%)] for non cytotoxic and cytotoxic chemotherapy respectively. The current evidence suggests that surgery alone has a consistently high rate of local recurrence in managing extra-abdominal desmoid tumors. Radiation therapy in combination with surgery improves local control rates. However, the limited data on systemic therapy for this rare tumor suggests the benefit of using both cytotoxic and non cytotoxic chemotherapy to achieve stable disease."
"five patients with partial response (PR); twelve patients with stable disease (SD) accounting for 77% with non-progressive disease; five patients showed PD. A 30% decrease of the mean average standardized uptake value (SUV) of sequential PET examinations could be demonstrated; no patient demonstrated a substantial increase in SUV. Patients with PR/SD were matched to a group of nonprogressive disease and tested versus PD. The initial average SUV and SUVmax seem to be candidates for a response prediction with an approximate P-value of 0.06553 and 0.07785, respectively. This is the first larger series of desmoid patients monitored using PET showing that early SUV changes may help to discriminate responders from nonresponders and, thus, to decide whether imatinib therapy should be continued."
"Extra-abdominal desmoid tumors continue to present unique challenges. Although the majority of patients can achieve durable local control, recalcitrant disease can prove frustrating for patients, their families, and providers. This is especially true when morbid local treatment modalities are undertaken in hopes of controlling a benign disease. There is little universal agreement regarding the optimal management of this potentially locally aggressive neoplasm; however, the overall goal of treatment is durable local control. Because of the unpredictable nature of desmoid tumors, treatment must be individualized on a case-by-case basis, utilizing a multimodal approach, and optimized in a multidisciplinary setting. Primary desmoid tumors that are symptomatic or progressing and can be excised with function-sparing surgery are treated operatively; surgical excision with negative margins (R0 resection) is generally the preferred method of treatment. Radiation therapy is used in combination with surgical resection for microscopically positive margins (R1 resection) when future recurrence may jeopardize limb preservation or function. For symptomatic or enlarging desmoids where surgery will incur significant functional deficits in order to obtain at best an R1 resection, definitive radiation or percutaneous ablation is utilized. Desmoid tumors that are asymptomatic, not enlarging, and located in areas that are remote from vital structures may be carefully observed. Systemic therapy is commonly utilized as an adjunct or primary treatment for symptomatic or enlarging tumors. The mainstay of treatment of recurrent desmoids tumor is surgery with a goal of an R0 resection often combined with radiation therapy. The evolving role of alternative methods of local control (such as cryoablation) is currently being investigated. As the cellular understanding of desmoid tumor improves, the ability to better predict the biological behavior will hopefully improve treatment selection."
"Infantile myofibromatosis (IM) is the most common benign fibrous tumor of soft tissues affecting young children. By using whole-exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and targeted sequencing, we investigated germline and tumor DNA in individuals from four distinct families with the familial form of IM and in five simplex IM cases with no previous family history of this disease. We identified a germline mutation c.1681C>T (p.Arg561Cys) in platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB) in all 11 affected individuals with familial IM, although none of the five individuals with nonfamilial IM had mutations in this gene. We further identified a second heterozygous mutation in PDGFRB in two myofibromas from one of the affected familial cases, indicative of a potential second hit in this gene in the tumor. PDGFR-beta promotes growth of mesenchymal cells, including blood vessels and smooth muscles, which are affected in IM. Our findings indicate p.Arg561Cys substitution in PDGFR-beta as a cause of the dominant form of this disease. They provide a rationale for further investigations of this specific mutation and gene to assess the benefits of targeted therapies against PDGFR-beta in aggressive life-threatening familial forms of the disease."
"Characteristics and epidemiology of jaw tumours have been described mostly in adults. Compared with their adult counterparts, childhood jaw tumours show considerable differences. The aim of this study was to describe the different jaw tumours in children, define diagnostic tools to determine their specificity and describe optimal treatment. METHODS: All children patients with jaw lesions, excluding cysts, apical granuloma and osteitis were included in our study between 1999 and 2009. The medical records were analyzed for clinical, radiological, and pathological findings, treatments and recurrences. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 10.9 years old, ranging from 2 months to 18 years old. Of the 63 lesions, 18 were odontogenic and 45 non-odontogenic lesions. 6% of all cases were malignant tumours; the mean age of presentation was 7.25 years old, [ranging from 0.2 to 18 years old]. Approximately 80% of the tumours developed after 6 years of age. Odontogenic tumours occurred more often after the age of 6. CONCLUSION: Compared with their adult counterpart, childhood jaw tumours show considerable differences in their clinical behaviour and radiological and pathological characteristics. Clinical features of some tumours can be specific to children. Tumourigenesis is related to dental development and facial growth. Conservative treatment should be considered."
"Hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) is highly heterogeneous, both genotypically and phenotypically. The most frequently occurring hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome is Lynch syndrome, accounting for approximately 3% of the total colorectal cancer burden. Polyposis syndromes, such as familial adenomatous polyposis, account for a lesser percentage. Familial colorectal cancer, defined by family history, occurs in an estimated 20% of all colorectal cancer cases. With a worldwide annual colorectal cancer incidence of over one million, and annual mortality of over 600,000, hereditary and familial forms of colorectal cancer are a major public health problem. Lynch syndrome is attributable to DNA mismatch repair germline mutations, with the MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, and PMS2 genes being implicated. The characteristics of Lynch syndrome-associated colorectal tumors, including early age of onset and predilection to the proximal colon, mandate surveillance by colonoscopy beginning by age 20 to 25 and repeated every other year through age 40 and annually thereafter. Besides colorectal cancer, Lynch syndrome also predisposes to a litany of extracolonic cancers, foremost of which is endometrial cancer, followed by cancer of the ovary, stomach, renal pelvis and ureter, small bowel, hepatobiliary tract, pancreas, glioblastoma multiforme in the Turcot's variant, and sebaceous skin tumors in the Muir-Torre variant and, more recently identified, cancers of the breast and prostate. The most common polyposis syndrome is familial adenomatous polyposis, caused by mutations in the APC gene. Affected individuals have multiple colonic adenomas and, without treatment invariably develop colorectal cancer. Colonic surveillance with polypectomy may be pursued until the appearance of multiple colonic adenomas, at which time prophylactic colectomy should be considered. Extra-intestinal manifestations include desmoid tumor, hepatoblastoma, thyroid carcinoma, and medulloblastoma. Other polyposis syndromes include the hamartomatous polyp syndromes, including juvenile polyposis syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, Cowden syndrome, and Bannayan-Ruvalcaba-Riley syndrome."
"The article analyses the 17-year (1993-2009 yy) experience of surgical treatment of desmoid fibroma and sarcoma of the thoracic and abdominal wall. 46 operations were analyzed. The radical excision according to the principles of surgical oncology remains the mainstay in the treatment of such patients. The combined technique with the use of polymeric implantates allows to cover large wall defects, thus extending the operability borders and being one of the main factors of the better treatment prognosis."
"Desmoid tumors (also called desmoids fibromatosis) are rare slow growing benign and musculoaponeurotic tumors. Although these tumors have a propensity to invade surrounding tissues, they are not malignant. These tumors are associated with women of fertile age, especially during and after pregnancy. We report a young female patient with a giant desmoid tumor of the anterior abdominal wall who underwent primary resection. The patient had no history of an earlier abdominal surgery. Preoperative evaluation included abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The histology revealed a desmoid tumor. Primary surgical resection with immediate reconstruction of abdominal defect is the best management of this rarity. To the best of our knowledge and PubMed search, this is the first case ever reported in the medical literature of such a giant desmoid tumor arising from anterior abdominal wall weighing 6.5 kg treated surgically with successful outcome."
"To evaluate the clinical feature and therapy of rare aggressive fibromatosis in the head and neck. METHOD: Clinicopathologic data of 12 cases of aggressive fibromatosis in the head and neck were analysed. All cases underwent surgical excision, one case received radiotherapy in addition to surgery. RESULT: Six cases recurred after cutting off. One of them recurred twice no death was found following operation. CONCLUSION: Aggressive fibromatosis in the head and neck is a rare benign, non-metastatic proliferation tumor of fibrous tissue with a capacity of infiltration to surrounding structures and a tendency of local recurrence after surgical resection. Complete surgical excision was considered to be the only effective method of cure. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be used in unsatisfactory surgical marginal recurrence."
"Desmoid tumor (DT) or aggressive fibromatosis is a histologically benign-appearing neoplasms of the soft tissues, arising from connective tissues, the fascial sheaths and musculoaponevrotic structures of muscles. DT is a non-metastasizing tumor but has a potential for local invasion and local recurrence. DT can be seen in all age groups including young children. The overall incidence is reported as 2-4 cases per million per year. The etiology of DT is unknown. However, a genetic predisposition, familial adenomatous polyposis and Gardner's syndrome, has been implicated in 2% of the cases. The histological diagnosis has to be confirmed by biopsy in order to eliminate other sarcomas. The clinical behavior of DT seems unpredictable with a high rate of local recurrence. Treatment depends on the aggressiveness of the disease. A ""wait-and-see"" strategy is, at the present time, preferred in case of asymptomatic or non-progressive disease. Complete resection after surgery is rare, that is why first-line surgery should be seriously questioned and only considered when a complete resection can be feasible without functional or cosmetic damage. If not, medical treatments (cytotoxic or not) are rather discussed. Radiation therapy is rarely an option in children in this benign tumor. Authors present accurate knowledge of this disease in children."

"Isolated pancreatic desmoid tumors with cyst formation are uncommon benign mesenchymal soft tissue tumors, characterized by the dense fibroblastic proliferations with abundant extra-cellular collagen matrix. Intra-abdominal desmoid tumor usually involve the mesentery and retroperitoneum and mostly occur in association of familial adenomatous polyposis or Gardner's syndrome. While desmoid tumors do not metastasize, their advancement can be life threatening due to aggressive local invasion, such as mesentery involvement. Isolated, sporadic pancreatic desmoid tumors have been considered anecdotal, with only 10 cases (cystic area in three cases) described in the literature. To our best of knowledge, this patient is fourth case report displaying cyst formation in desmoid tumor of pancreatic tail. CASE REPORT: We herein report a very unusual location of sporadic desmoid tumor involving the pancreatic tail with cystic area diagnosed by beta-catenin immunostaining. A 11-year-old male presented with painless lump in left hypochondrium of abdomen. The diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma was suspected preoperatively and the patient underwent a splenopancreatectomy. Histopathological examination revealed dense fibroblastic proliferation with occasional mitosis suggestive of mesenchymal tumor. The diagnosis of desmoid tumor was confirmed by positivity of beta-catenin immunohistochemical analysis. Conservative treatment was given postoperatively. No recurrence was observed after ten months of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Desmoid tumors are very rare in the tail of pancreas with cystic area and their diagnosis can be difficult, such as in our case where it presented as a solid-cystic lesion."
"Desmoid tumor is a rare benign mesenchymal neoplasm in children primarily originated in the muscle connective tissue, fascial sheaths, and musculoaponeurotic structures. It is often misdiagnosed as fibroids, reactive processes or low-grade fibrosarcomas. It is characterized by slow growth, locally aggressive nature, high recurrence rate without metastasize capacity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 7 year old girl with right paramandibular tumor, a year of evolution. It was characterized by slow and painless growth, trismus and mandibular latero-deviation to the left during mouth opening. Imaging tests showed soft parts tumor in masseteric region with a periosteal reaction in the mandibular body. The biopsy reported a desmoid tumor. RESULTS: Risdon approach was performed for tumor resection and external cortical Split mandibular body, without preserving the marginal branch of CP VII. The pathology reports of aggressive fibromatosis without bone involvement. It currently presents marginal paralysis and free-disease. CONCLUSIONS: Desmoid tumors of head and neck are difficult to treat because of the proximity or involvement in vital structures, infiltrative nature and tendency to local recurrence. Primary surgery with negative surgical margins is the treatment of choice. However, in many cases this involves disfiguring surgery. Therefore, in these cases and in those surgical margins affections, the use of chemotherapy/non-cytotoxic drugs can be an alternative. Because they are low incidence tumors prospective multicenter studies are needed to clarify the role of adjuvant treatment in this tumor."
"Extra-abdominal desmoid tumors are extremely rare in the hand. These tumors do not metastasize; however, they are potentially locally invasive and have extremely high local recurrence rates after surgical excision with reports of up to 78% recurrence, specifically in the hand. We describe the first case of a desmoid tumor originating from the extensor mechanism of a digit and discuss our treatment approach. In addition, a literature review performed shows a male predominance of desmoid tumors in the hand in the 30- to 50-year-old age group. Current evidence supports aggressive early wide surgical excision and reconstruction to preserve function."
"We report a rare case of a giant desmoid tumour responsible for cardiac and respiratory failure. Complete removal was decided upon, despite an initial failure in another centre because of symptom severity. In such cases, wide local resection remains the best therapeutic approach, but the risk of local recurrence is high. Literature review confirms the exceptional presentation and the benefit of aggressive surgery."
"Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) has become the treatment of choice in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) to prevent the risk of colorectal cancer. However, it currently is recognized that adenomas may develop in the ileal pouch. The risk of adenoma occurring in the afferent ileal loop above the pouch is less clearly identified. This study aimed to evaluate the difference in prevalence of adenomas between the ileal pouch and the afferent ileum after IPAA in FAP. METHODS: The study analyzed 442 endoscopies performed between 2003 and 2008 for 139 FAP patients. The patients had undergone an IPAA in 118 cases, an ileorectal anastomosis in 13 cases, or an ileostomy in 8 cases. RESULTS: Among the 118 IPAA patients, 57 (48.3 %) had pouch adenomas a median of 15 years after surgery. The risk factors for pouch adenomas were delay since pouch construction [odds ratio (OR), 1.11; p = 0.016] and presence of advanced duodenal adenomas (OR, 4.35; p = 0.011). Seven patients had pouch adenomas with high-grade dysplasia. Only nine patients had afferent ileal loop adenomas (6.5 %). The only significant risk factor for ileal adenomas was the presence of pouch adenomas (OR, 2.16; p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: After restorative proctocolectomy in FAP, adenoma recurrence is frequent in the pouch, with a higher risk for patients with advanced duodenal adenomas and an increasing risk over time, whereas adenomas are rarely found in the afferent ileal loop. This finding may help to propose redo ileal pouch anal anastomosis if required."
"Enlargement of the gingiva can be due to various causes. Most prevalent are the inflammatory type and drug-induced type of gingival hyperplasia. However, sever enlargement associated with an aggressive type of periodontitis is an infrequent finding. Reported here is a case of a female patient aged 18 years who presented with severe enlargement of the maxillary and mandibular gingiva. Examination revealed enlargement extending up to the incisal edge of all the teeth and also an associated generalized loss of attachment with radiographic evidence of reduced bone height resembling an aggressive type of periodontitis. There were no associated systemic signs and symptoms or any family history except that there was generalized vitiligo of the skin and oral mucous membrane. The case was treated by gross electrosection of the gingiva."
"Desmoid is a rare tumor that is intermediate between benign and malignant neoplasms. Clinical, laboratory, and instrumental evidence shows the signs characteristic for both neoplastic and benign processes. The purpose of our study is to present two breast desmoid cases observed in our clinic and to demonstrate all stages of this diagnosis, by using specific examples."
"We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of desmoid tumor (DT) patients treated by surgical excision. METHODS: Among 155 consecutive patients, 119 patients satisfied our inclusion criteria. The mean follow-up duration was 82 months. Age, gender, location, size, depth, resection margin, adjuvant radiotherapy, and excision history were analyzed for the outcomes. RESULTS: The recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were 75% at 5 years and 72% at 10 years. Twenty-seven (93.1%) out of 29 recurrences were detected within 5 years. In multivariate analysis, positive resection margin and excision history were independently associated with the RFS. In the comparison between the propensity score matched groups, adjuvant radiotherapy was not significantly associated with the RFS. The mean time interval from surgery to recurrence was 30.0 +/- 28.7 months (median, 20 months; range, 4-123 months). This interval was significantly longer for patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy than for those who received surgical resection only, both in all recurrences and in recurrences in matched cases. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical excision appears to be a reliable treatment option for DTs. However, positive outcomes require a clear resection margin. Adjuvant radiotherapy may delay the recurrence of the tumor, although it seems to have no effect on the ultimate relapse rate."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is a rare benign myofibroblastic neoplasm of the connective tissue that is unable to metastasize but is associated with a high local recurrence rate. Nuclear beta-catenin is the most commonly used histological marker of DF; however, clinical and biological predictive markers guiding the treatment and follow-up of DF are still lacking. Normally, beta-catenin is regulated by the cytoplasmic multiprotein complex of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), axin, casein kinase 1alpha (CK1alpha), and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta); this phosphorylates and degrades beta-catenin, which would otherwise translocate to the nucleus. The aim of this study was to analyse the expression and localization of the beta-catenin-protein complex of the Wnt pathway in cells isolated from DF patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We isolated cells from biopsies of DF patients, and demonstrated, by immunofluorescence and immunoblot analyses, that it is almost exclusively nuclear GSK-3beta that colocalizes and interacts with beta-catenin. The nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and GSK-3beta is not correlated with CTNNB1 mutations. In DF samples, the multiprotein complex is disrupted, as the cytoplasmic localization of APC and axin makes interaction with the nuclear beta-catenin and GSK-3beta impossible. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that GSK-3beta is an additional DF marker with an important role in the aetiopathogenesis of this entity."
We report a familial adenomatous polyposis patient with a known truncating mutation on exon 15 of the APC gene who developed an invasive follicular thyroid cancer in addition to multiple intra-cranial and spinal desmoids. This combination of manifestations has not previously been recorded in the literature.
Desmoid tumors are benign neoplasms that most often arise from muscle aponeurosis and have been associated with both trauma and pregnancy. The etiology of desmoids has not been determined. We report the case of anterior abdominal wall desmoid tumor in a female patient with previous history of cesarean section. Preoperative ultrasound and computed tomography demonstrated a large mass mimicking a large hematoma or an intraabdominal mass. The tumor was removed by wide excision with safe margins. The abdominal wall defect was reconstructed with polypropylene mesh. Subsequent histology revealed a desmoid tumor. Desmoid tumors in females are often associated with pregnancy or occur post-partum. The reasons behind this association are unclear. The most common sites are in the abdominal muscles.
"Desmoid tumors (also called aggressive fibromatosis) are histologically benign, but have a strong tendency to recur locally after resection. They are rare neoplastic tumors that may occur sporadically or in association with familial adenomatous polyposis caused by a germline mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene. The etiology of desmoid tumors is unknown, but their association with a history of abdominal surgery, trauma, and estrogen therapy is well known. CASE PRESENTATION: A 36-year-old Asian woman was referred complaining of an abdominal tumor. She had no history of familial adenomatous polyposis, abdominal surgery, trauma or pregnancy. A laparoscopy-assisted right hemicolectomy with a minilaparotomy was conducted for resection of her right-side colon and the anterior wall of her duodenum. The histopathological diagnosis was a desmoid tumor that grew from the transverse mesocolon. Mutational analysis indicated a mutation of the beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1), consisting of a substitution of threonine for alanine at codon 41. The patient has been followed postoperatively for more than 3 years without any sign of recurrence. CONCLUSION: We report a case of sporadic colonic desmoid tumor which was resected by laparoscopic surgery. A successful outcome was achieved because there has been no local recurrence for more than 3 years. The tumor grew from the transverse mesocolon, and harbored a mutation of the CTNNB1 gene. Mutational analysis of CTNNB1 gene may play an important role as a prognostic marker of desmoid tumors."
"25 months after the end of chemotherapy, the tumor volume had regressed by 95% when compared to the start of computed tomography and by 90% when compared to the end of chemotherapy. Thirty-three months after the diagnosis, the patient is alive without any symptom. Our case provides further evidence of the remarkable efficacy of a doxorubicin-dacarbazine regimen, especially in function- or life-threatening situations where a rapid response is required. We review the literature and discuss the challenging issue regarding treatment of desmoid tumors."
"Chest wall desmoid-type fibromatoses are rare, locally aggressive tumors that occasionally arise from previous thoracotomy sites. Tumors arising from previous sites of thoracotomy to treat malignant disease should be discriminated from the pleural dissemination of the previous malignancy. In this study, we report a case of desmoid-type fibromatosis arising from a site for thoracotomy to treat lung cancer. Additionally we reviewed 15 reported cases of desmoid-type fibromatosis following thoracotomy and summarized their features. A 62-year-old woman was found to have a tumor on computed tomography (CT) at a 1-year routine checkup for lung cancer. The tumor (diameter, 3.4 cm) was located at the previous thoracotomy site. Positron emission tomography (PET) revealed mild (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation in the tumor, with a maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 1.9. CT-guided biopsy revealed only fibrous tissue. Eighteen months after the biopsy, CT revealed apparent tumor growth, and a biopsy revealed the same histology observed previously. The tumor was removed and diagnosed as desmoid-type fibromatosis. Currently, the patient is alive without recurrence 4 years after desmoid surgery."
"Desmoid tumors are currently the main cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. More than 10% of these patients will develop these tumors during their lifetime and more than a third will suffer their consequences. The main risk factors for their development are female sex and abdominal surgery. The most frequent localization is intraabdominal. The therapeutic approach to these tumors has changed, and the surgical treatment of choice is currently the subject of debate. If a watch and wait approach is adopted, more than 50% of tumors will prove to be indolent. Therefore, the therapeutic strategy should be based on clinical presentation and should be decided by a multidisciplinary team working in a center with experience of these tumors. The present article proposes a prognostic classification to guide the therapeutic approach."
"To construct a postoperative nomogram to estimate the risk of local recurrence for patients with desmoid tumors. BACKGROUND: The standard management of desmoid tumors is resection, but many recur locally. Other options include observation or novel chemotherapeutics, but little guidance exists on selecting treatment. METHODS: Patients undergoing resection during 1982-2011 for primary or locally recurrent desmoids were identified from a single-institution prospective database. Cox regression analysis was used to assess risk factors and to create a recurrence nomogram, which was validated using an international, multi-institutional data set. RESULTS: Desmoids were treated surgically in 495 patients (median follow-up of 60 months). Of 439 patients undergoing complete gross resection, 100 (23%) had recurrence. Five-year local recurrence-free survival was 69%. Eight patients died of disease, all after R2 resection. Adjuvant radiation was not associated with improved local recurrence-free survival. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with recurrence were extremity location, young age, and large tumor size, but not margin. Abdominal wall tumors had the best outcome (5-year local recurrence-free survival rate of 91%). Age, site, and size were used to construct a nomogram with concordance index of 0.703 in internal validation and 0.659 in external validation. Integration of additional variables (R1 margin, sex, depth, and primary vs recurrent presentation) did not importantly improve concordance (internal concordance index of 0.707). CONCLUSIONS: A postoperative nomogram including only size, site, and age predicts local recurrence and can aid in counseling patients. Systemic therapies may be appropriate for young patients with large, extremity desmoids, but surgery alone is curative for most abdominal wall lesions."
"Spinal fibromatosis is a unique subset of fibromatosis that is only anecdotally described in the literature in sporadic case reports. According to our review of the literature, only 11 cases of spinal fibromatosis have been previously documented. This paucity of clinical data limits our understanding of its presentation and treatment. PURPOSE: The authors present the first two cases of spinal fibromatosis encountered at their institution, and review the literature of reported cases to elucidate the presentation and outcomes of patients with this rare tumor. STUDY DESIGN: A report of two cases and review of the literature. METHODS: The two patients in our case report were women aged 45 and 38 years. Both of the patients presented to our clinic after previous excisional biopsy of a spinal mass, 17 years and 1 year later, respectively, with pain and paresthesias that recapitulated their former symptoms. Thirteen cases, including the two described in the current article, were culled from the literature. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an enhancing lesion in the posterior elements of the spinal column in the first case and a paraspinal soft tissue mass in the second case. The tumors were histologically defined by haphazardly arranged, elongated, and slender spindle cells separated by abundant collagen without mitoses or necrosis. Surgical management resulted in intralesional resection in the first case and en bloc resection in the second case. By 40 and 10 months after surgery, both patients remain without neurologic deficits. CONCLUSIONS: Among 13 cases of spinal fibromatosis, pain with or without a mass is the most common symptom at presentation. Tumor etiology is evenly distributed between de novo origin and surgical trauma. Treatment outcomes, although, cannot be determined from the limited data currently available."

"Intra-abdominal desmoid tumor is a life-threatening disease. Studies have shown that dacarbazine (DTIC)-doxorubicin (DOX) (D-D) therapy is the most effective treatment. However, myelosuppression is a major problem, and cardiac muscle disorders due to DOX limit the number of administration cycles, whereas it usually requires a long time to achieve tumor shrinkage. To resolve these issues, we introduced low-dose D-D therapy to 3 patients employing 50 mg/m(2) DOX and 600-700 mg/m(2) DTIC per cycle, which permits repeated administration cycles up to 10-11 times. Case 1 was a 23-year-old female with a sporadic recurrent mesenterium desmoid tumor located in the pelvis (maximum diameter, 8 cm). Cases 2 and 3 were a 33-year-old female and a 36-year-old male. Both patients had intra-abdominal mesenterium desmoid tumors (maximum diameter 9.6 and 9.0 cm, respectively) that were generated after proctocolectomy due to familial adenomatous polyposis. No severe adverse events occurred during the therapy. With the aid of sulindac and tamoxifen after low-dose D-D therapy, the first two patients achieved a complete response, and the third patient achieved a partial response and awaits further tumor shrinkage. Our experience indicates that low-dose DT-D therapy is a safe and effective regimen for patients with intra-abdominal desmoid tumors."
"Extra-abdominal desmoid tumor is a rare soft tissue tumor that is histologically benign, but may behave aggressively. This case report specifically describes the clinical, radiographic, and pathologic features of 27 year-old female who experienced a post-surgical recurrence of fibromatosis of the chest wall over a two-year period of time secondary to previous inadequate excision. The fibromatosis was found to be involving the lower-inner quadrant of her right breast and causing worsening pain. A surgical management strategy was successfully undertaken."
"Studies of percutaneous cryotherapy in the treatment of benign or malignant soft tissue tumours are rare and mainly involve small populations. Nevertheless, results show cryotherapy's potential in terms of local control of tumours, analgesic efficacy, reduced intra- and postoperative complications, and reduction in the length of convalescence after the procedure. The objective of this update is to set out the short-term prospects for this technique in the treatment of soft tissue tumours, so that it may be more widely offered in these indications."
"Desmoplastic fibroma (DF) is an extremely rare locally aggressive bone tumor with an incidence of 0.11% of all primary bone tumors. The typical clinical presentation is pain and swelling above the affected area. The most common sites of involvement are the mandible and the metaphysis of long bones. Histologically and biologically, desmoplastic fibroma mimics extra-abdominal desmoid tumor of soft tissue. CASE PRESENTATION AND LITERATURE REVIEW: A case of a 27-year old man with DF in the ilium, including the clinical, radiological and histological findings over a 4-year period is presented here. CT scans performed in 3-year intervals prior to surgical intervention were compared with respect to tumor extension and cortical breakthrough. The patient was treated with curettage and grafting based on anatomical considerations. Follow-up CT scans over 18-months are also documented here. Additionally, a review and analysis of 271 cases including the presented case with particular emphasis on imaging patterns in MRI and CT as well as treatment modalities and outcomes are presented. CONCLUSION: In patients with desmoplastic fibroma, CT is the preferred imaging technique for both the diagnosis of intraosseus tumor extension and assessment of cortical involvement, whereas MRI is favored for the assessment of extraosseus tumor growth and preoperative planning. While tumor resection remains the preferred treatment for DF, curettage and grafting prove to be an acceptable alternative treatment modality with close follow-up when resection is not possible. Curettage and grafting have been shown to provide good clinical results and are associated with long recurrence free intervals."
"Desmoid tumor is a rare type of cancer that develops in the tissues that form tendons and ligaments. These tumors, also called aggressive fibromatosis, are considered benign with no metastatic potential. They may invade nearby tissues and organs, however, and can be difficult to control. Desmoid tumor in the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) of the knee has never been described in the literature. CASE PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of posteromedial knee dull pain and decreased range of motion of the knee. He was diagnosed desmoid tumor of posterior cruciate ligament of the knee by intraoperative biopsy, and underwent successful PCL resection and reconstruction by Four-strand semitendinosus and gracilis tendon autograft arthroscopically, and fortunately five years after operation, there were no clues as to recurrence of the tumor examined by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). CONCLUSION: Desmoid tumor is characterized by infiltrative growth and a tendency towards recurrence,as this tumor entity is rare, data giving evidence based recommendations for the optimal treatment algorithm for this disease is lacking. At present there is no definite and effective method of treatment. However, early detection of the tumor play an important role, MRI is now the most important method for the detection of tumor extent, which facilitates the treatment choice as well as the prediction of prognosis. In our case, we followed-up the patient five years postoperatively by MRI and got a good result."
"We describe an exciting and novel surgical option, which may be used to treat formerly unresectable masses. This process is commonly referred to as autotransplantation (AuTn), and it combines the advances in transplant medicine and applies them to surgical oncology. The idea behind AuTn is the removal of the cancerous organ(s) to allow complete anatomic resection of the tumor mass, with consequent anastomotic reimplantation or AuTn of the now macroscopically tumor-free organ back into the patient. Autotransplantation has been used to remove large fibromatosis and desmoid tumors as well as malignant tumors. Our belief is that using lessons learned from the field of transplantation, AuTn can be applied in gynecologic oncology."
"Fibromatosis is a slow-growing monoclonal proliferation of fibroblasts. Although histologically benign it is locally invasive and can recur, however, without metastatic potential. Extra-abdominal fibromatosis is not common. Surgical resection is the cornerstone of treatment and radiation therapy is used in incomplete resection, however, its role is not proved through prospective randomised trials. This article presents a 17-year-old Iranian girl with chest wall fibromatosis located just behind the right breast. The patient was operated with positive margin, however, we decided to postpone radiation therapy because of potential risks."
"Pediatric fibroblastic-myofibroblastic tumors of intermediate prognosis are locally aggressive tumors that rarely metastasize. They are potentially curable, but managing them is often a challenge in terms of their correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment. This paper reviews the most recent biological findings and latest novelties in the multidisciplinary treatment of childhood desmoid-type fibromatoses, infantile fibrosarcoma and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor."
"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a multi-system disease characterised by the development of hundreds to thousands of colorectal adenomas which inevitably progress to carcinoma without treatment. It is commonly associated with extra colonic lesions including osteomas, epidermoid cysts and desmoid tumours. Desmoid tumours are troublesome due to their size and bulk and are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in FAP. This series highlights three cases in which patients with FAP developed masses thought initially to be manifestations of the condition. Further investigation in fact demonstrated neurofibromatosis type 1 in all three patients. All masses in FAP patients cannot be assumed to be disease related (desmoid, osteoma, epidermoid cyst or carcinoma)."
"Desmoid tumors are rare benign fibrous tumors, which have a tendency to invade locally. A minority of desmoids are mesenterial. The symptoms of mesenterial desmoids are misleading, and diagnosis can be delayed. A complete surgical excision is the preferred treatment, but the mesenterial location of the tumor makes radical surgery complicated. Patients whose tumors are not amenable to surgical treatment, have been treated with antiestrogens, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatorics and various chemotherapeutics. Good responses have been observed with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. In most cases, the quality of life can be maintained even in incurable situations."
"Fibromatosis arising from the breast, also referred to as desmoid tumor, aggressive fibromatosis, or low-grade fibrosarcoma, is a rare benign entity, accounting for only 0.2% of all breast tumors. Associations with familial multicentric fibromatosis and trauma, including that resulting from surgical intervention, have been reported. Awareness of this lesion is important, as the diagnosis has often been confused with that of breast carcinoma. We present the case of a 30-year-old white woman who presented with a palpable mass within the medial portion of her right breast. She reported breast carcinoma in both her paternal grandmother and maternal aunt. Subsequent mammographic and sonographic evaluation demonstrated an irregular solid mass within the posteromedial portion of the right breast. Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy revealed low-grade myofibroblastic proliferation consistent with breast fibromatosis. The lesion was surgically resected via wide local excision. Follow-up mammograms performed 1 and 2 years after resection demonstrated no radiographic evidence of recurrence."
"A 64-year-old man underwent resection of a mesenteric desmoid tumor in May 2006. He presented with a chief complaint of loss of appetite at a local hospital in July 2011. A huge abdominal tumor was detected on computed tomography, and he was referred to our hospital. We suspected recurrence of the desmoid tumor 5 years and 2 months after the first surgery and performed re-resection, revealing two tumors, measuring 32x29x10cm and 7.0x6.0x4.5cm, respectively. Histopathologic examination yielded a diagnosis of mesenteric desmoid tumor recurrence. Four months after re-resection, the patient is alive without recurrence."
progressive growth of a solitary abdominal wall mass during pregnancy and well-delineated smooth tumor margins demonstrated by imaging techniques. This case emphasizes the importance of entertaining uncommon medical conditions in the differential diagnosis of seemingly common clinical manifestations.
"Desmoid tumors most often occur in abdominal wall. Their tendency to recur lead to repeated operations which can make the abdominal wall reconstruction difficult. We report a 28-year-old female history. The patient was referred to our hospital for a recurrent desmoid tumor of the abdominal wall. The tumor was totally removed. The reconstruction was successful and the patient recovery was uneventful. Radical surgery still the mainstay of the desmoid tumors treatement. In abdominal wall location, the reconstruction can be a real challenge. Many procedures are discussed in literature. We used a double layer mesh covered by a fascial bepedicled flap. Taking into account their unpredictable behaviour and treatment complications, recurrent abdominal desmoid tumors can be managed simply and efficiently."
"In the head and neck region, desmoid-type fibromatosis is an uncommon tumor, and the imaging features have not been well described. The purpose of this study was to describe imaging features with their pathologic correlation of desmoid-type fibromatosis in this region. METHODS: Computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images of nine consecutive patients (five women and four men; age range, 2-72 years; mean age, 28 years) with desmoid-type fibromatosis in the head and neck were retrospectively evaluated, focusing on lesion location, size, shape, presence of a rim of surrounding fat, CT attenuation, signal intensity, and enhancement characteristics on MR with pathologic correlation. RESULTS: Desmoid-type fibromatosis involved perivertebral space (n = 5) and carotid space (n = 1) in six adult patients. In three pediatric patients, the fibromatosis primarily involved submandibular space (n = 2) and masticator space (n = 1) with frequent invasion to the adjacent spaces (3/3). A mean greatest dimension of 5.8 cm, elongated shape (7/9), and rim of surrounding fat (8/9) were the common features of the desmoid-type fibromatosis. Tumors often showed iso (3/7) or high attenuation (3/7) on postcontrast CT, high signal intensity (6/9) on T2-weighted image, iso signal intensity (8/9) on T1-weighted image, and strong MR enhancement (8/9). Characteristic nonenhancing low signal intensity bands (8/9) on all MR sequences were well correlated with dense collagenous stroma. CONCLUSIONS: Desmoid-type fibromatosis in the head and neck of adults frequently involves perivertebral space. Along with various common imaging features, desmoid-type fibromatosis shows characteristic nonenhancing low signal intensity bands on MR images."
"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is caused by mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Desmoid tumours affect up to 26 per cent of patients and contribute significantly to death. This study aimed to assess the influence of sex and mutation site on desmoid tumour development and sex-specific genetic differences in patients with FAP with and without desmoid tumours. METHODS: Patients with FAP-associated desmoid tumours recorded in the Heidelberg Polyposis Register between 1991 and 2010 were identified. These patients were analysed with respect to clinical parameters and possible risk factors. RESULTS: Some 105 patients with FAP-associated desmoid tumours of a total of 585 patients with FAP were analysed. Male patients had a significantly greater number of desmoid tumours and a larger tumour mass, although tumours were more common in female patients. Desmoid tumours in male patients were located more often in the abdominal wall. Seventy-nine (75.2 per cent) of the 105 patients demonstrated a clear temporal association between a previous operation and subsequent desmoid tumour development; most of these patients were female. Mutation sites in male patients were limited to exons 5, 14 and 15, whereas female patients carried mutations along the entire coding region of the APC gene. Twenty-one per cent of patients with desmoid tumours carried mutations within the 'desmoid region', compared with only 4.1 per cent of the control group without desmoids. CONCLUSION: There are significant sex differences concerning desmoid tumour manifestation. Female patients appear to have a higher risk of desmoid tumour occurrence independent of the mutation site, whereas in male patients the mutation site seems to exert more influence."
"Sirtuin, silent mating-type information regulation 2 homolog Saccharomyces cerevisiae 1 (SIRT1), is a protein that has been implicated in multiple mammalian functions including cell aging, stress resistance, and differentiation. SIRT1 has also been shown to be involved in multiple tumors. In addition, new pharmacotherapies have recently been approved that target SIRT1. The purpose of this study was to use immunohistochemistry to characterize SIRT1 protein expression in human soft tissue neoplasms with the hopes of finding new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. SIRT1 immunoreactivity was reviewed in a series of 164 soft tissue tumors including alveolar soft part sarcoma, angiomyolipoma, clear cell sarcoma, desmoid/fibromatosis, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, Ewing sarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, glomus tumor, leiomyoma, leiomyosarcoma, lipoma, liposarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, nodular fasciitis, osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, schwannoma, solitary fibrous tumor, synovial sarcoma, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, and Wilms tumor. In addition, numerous benign tissues were tested for SIRT1 reactivity. In nonneoplastic tissue, strong cytoplasmic SIRT1 reactivity was observed in all prostate stroma, smooth muscle, and striated muscle. A similar pattern of cytoplasmic SIRT1 expression was observed in soft tissue neoplasms with myoid differentiation, namely, angiomyolipoma (100%), glomus tumor (100%), leiomyoma (90%), leiomyosarcoma (76.5%), and rhabdomyosarcoma (87%). The other lesions examined were negative. Although the physiologic role of SIRT1 remains to be clarified in myoid tissues and neoplasms differentiating along these lines, this observation points to a potential role for this marker in diagnostic immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, the recent emergence of drugs capable of selectively inhibiting SIRT1 raises the possibility of a potential application for targeted therapy. Additional studies are necessary to further characterise the role of SIRT1 in myoid tissues and neoplasms."
"Desmoid fibromatosis is associated with frequent recurrence and significant morbidity, but no metastases. To examine the impact of initial non-operative management on event-free survival (EFS) in children, we reviewed our institutional experience with this tumor. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our institutional database for pediatric cases of desmoid fibromatosis treated between 1970 and 2010. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were identified, with a median follow-up of 6 years. Median age at diagnosis was 16 years. Forty-seven patients presented with primary tumors, and forty-six had recurrent or progressing disease. Five-year OS was 100%, and 5-year EFS was 31.8%, with a median time to event of 1.48 years. There was no significant difference in 5-year EFS between patients who were managed expectantly and those who initially received treatment (21% versus 34%, P=.09). Sex, race, history of trauma, or familial adenomatous polyposis, multifocality, tumor size, tumor location, and resection status did not correlate with EFS. CONCLUSION: Our findings support a conservative initial approach in the management of desmoid fibromatosis. In patients at risk for morbid procedures, upfront resection should be reserved for select tumors that demonstrate aggressive growth or cause serious symptoms."
"Desmoid tumors (DTs) are benign tumors which are not seen very often, and most of the radiologists and clinicians do not know the characteristics of them very well. Correct and early diagnosis of DTs is important for decreasing mortality and morbidity. Computed tomography enterography (CTE) is a new modality for small bowel imaging which combines the improved spatial and temporal resolution of multidetector computed tomography (CT) with large volumes of ingested enteric contrast material to permit evaluation of the small bowel wall and lumen and also the entire abdomen. We report a familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patient with localized mesentery and abdominal wall DTs. We showed the exact location of the DTs and their relation with the small bowel by CTE. In conclusion, CTE is a useful technique for DT localization, the degree of extension and invasion to local structures, presence of partial and complete small bowel obstruction, and the relationship of the tumors with vasculature and whether ischemia has occurred as a result or not."
"Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors (IADTs) are a common complication of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Treatment is not standardized for advanced disease. Medical and surgical treatments may be ineffective in preventing complications, which can cause intestinal failure. Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) can be a life-saving treatment in these patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the association with HPN in FAP-IADTs. METHODS: A retrospective review of FAP patients with IADTs at the Cleveland Clinic (CC) between 1980 and 2009 was performed. Patients and tumor characteristics were retrieved from the CC Jagelman Registry for Inherited Neoplasms and CC HPN database. Inclusion criteria were FAP-IADTs and 6-month follow up at CC. Exclusion criteria were <6-month follow-up, lack of 3-dimensional lesion or sheet desmoid, and/or incomplete medical records. Kaplan-Meier curves were analyzed for HPN and non-HPN groups. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-four patients were included and divided into 2 groups: HPN (n = 41, 26.6%) and non-HPN (n = 113, 73.4%). The HPN group was more likely to have advanced-stage disease and significantly higher incidence of chronic abdominal pain, narcotic dependency, bowel obstruction, ureteral obstruction, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, fistulae, and sepsis (P < .05). The need for HPN represented a strong predictor of mortality (5-year survival HPN = 72% vs non-HPN = 95%), but duration of HPN did not affect mortality. CONCLUSION: HPN, although a life-saving treatment, is an independent poor prognostic factor associated with high morbidity and mortality."

"Aggressive fibromatosis is a benign but locally-aggressive tumor, which most often affects the muscles of the shoulder, the pelvic girdle, and the thigh. It usually affects adolescents and young adults. Desmoplastic fibroma, considered the bone counterpart of soft tissue fibromatosis, is a rare tumor that usually affects the metaphyseal or diaphyseal portions of long bones or, less commonly, the jaw. Neuromuscular hamartoma, a rare developmental lesion composed of mature elements of both striated muscle and nerve, is usually diagnosed in infants and children and affects large nerve trunks. Rarely, it can affect the head and neck region. Occasional cases showing an association between aggressive fibromatosis and neuromuscular hamartoma have been reported in the literature. Here we present a unique case of an adult patient with desmoplastic fibroma of the mandible in association with neuromuscular hamartoma."
"Desmoid fibromatosis (desmoid tumor, DT) is a soft tissue neoplasm prone to recurrence despite complete surgical resection. Numerous small retrospective reports suggest that non-cytotoxic chemotherapy using tamoxifen and sulindac may be effective for DT. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of tamoxifen and sulindac in a prospective phase II study within the Children's Oncology Group. PROCEDURES: Eligible patients were <19 years of age who had measurable DT that was recurrent or not amenable to surgery or radiation. The primary objective was to estimate progression-free survival (PFS). Patients received tamoxifen and sulindac daily for 12 months or until disease progression or intolerable toxicity occurred. Response was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Fifty-nine eligible patients were enrolled from 2004 to 2009; 78% were 10-18 years old. Twenty-two (38%) were previously untreated; 15 (41%) of the remaining 37 enrolling with recurrent DT had prior systemic chemotherapy and six (16%) had prior radiation. No life-threatening toxicity was reported. Twelve (40%) of 30 females developed ovarian cysts, which were asymptomatic in 11 cases. Ten patients completed therapy without disease progression or discontinuing treatment. Responses included four partial and one complete (5/59, 8%). The estimated 2-year PFS and survival rates were 36% (95% confidence interval: 0.23-0.48) and 96%, respectively. All three deaths were due to progressive DT. CONCLUSIONS: Tamoxifen and sulindac caused few serious side effects in children with DT, although ovarian cysts were common. However, the combination showed relatively little activity as measured by response and PFS rates."
"Mesentery fibromatosis, also called abdominal desmoid, is a rare clinical entity. It is part of the clinical-pathologic spectrum of so-called deep fibromatoses. The deep fibromatoses encompass a group of benign fibroproliferative processes that are locally aggressive; they may infiltrate the adjacent organs or recur, but do not create distant metastatic lesions. The small bowel mesentery is the most common site of intraabdominal fibromatosis. However, the omentum, ileocolic mesentery, transverse or sigmoid mesocolon, or ligamentum teres may be the site of origin for intraabdominal fibromatosis. Mesenteric fibromatosis occurs in a wide age range of patients, and has no gender or race predilection. Most cases of abdominal fibromatosis occur sporadically. In this article we would like to present a case report of a patient who was admitted to the clinic due to severe abdominal pain with clinically advanced peritoneal signs. The intraoperative findings were astonishing; we found a giant desmoid which originated in the mesentery. The tumor oppressed the ileum, leading to its obstruction."

"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) is characterized by a nonmetastatic fibroblastic proliferative lesion that is histologically benign with infiltrative growth and frequent recurrence. To our knowledge, infantile AF is rarely reported. There are no clear guidelines regarding the management and treatment strategies for intracranial infantile AF because of its rarity. In China, there are few reports in the clinical literature concerning intracranial infantile AF. We describe 2 cases of intracranial infantile AF and review the relevant literature to better understand the pathological features, differential diagnosis and treatment of this condition."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) is a rare intermediately and locally aggressive tumor that occurs predominantly between puberty and 40 years, with female having higher incidence than male. This report describes a 48-year-old man with biopsy-proven DF in left intermuscular spatium of buttock and thigh. The mass had a wide longitudinal distribution from femoral neck level to popliteal fossa and measured about 40 cm. Plain CT showed a partially ill-defined mass with an irregular contour, with a density similar or slightly higher than skeletal muscle. On MR images, the tumor showed uneven signal in both T(1)WI and T(2)WI, mainly hyperintense to skeletal muscle and with stripe or patch-like markedly low signal. After contrast injection, the mass showed heterogeneous enhancement."
"In the US, approximately 850-900 children are diagnosed each year with soft tissue sarcomas (STS). Key findings from recent Children's Oncology Group (COG) clinical trials include safe reduction in therapy for low risk rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), validation of FOXO1 fusion as a prognostic factor, a modest improvement in outcome for high-risk RMS, and a biologically designed non-cytotoxic therapy for pediatric desmoid tumor. Planned Phase 2 trials include targeted agents for VEGF/PDGF, mTOR, and IGF-1R for children with RMS and VEGF for children with non-RMS STS (NRSTS). For RMS, COG Phase 3 trials potentially will explore VEGF/mTOR inhibition or chemotherapy interval compression. For NRSTS, a COG Phase 3 trial will explore VEGF inhibition."

"Hysteroscopy and uterine curettage are required in cases of atypical hyperplasia in premenopause and in all cases of hyperplasia with/without atypia in postmenopausal women. Biopsic curettage is the method of choice in the diagnosis of endometrial pathology. Transvaginal ultrasound and Doppler examination are useful in assessing the risk of endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women without/with continuous replacement therapy, but cannot replace endometrial biopsy to exclude endometrial cancer diagnosis. Medical treatment with progesterone containing drugs addresses endometrial hyperplasia without atypia. Surgical treatment is recommended for premenopausal and postmenopausal patients with uterine fibromatosis associated with atypical hyperplasia as well as patients with adenocarcinoma. Risk of progression to malignancy requires clinical and histopathological monitoring to avoid insufficient treatment of lesions with evolutive risk and aggressive treatment of lesions without risk."
"A 51-year-old male patient with no history of medical illnesses presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and a temperature of 39 degrees Celsius. His condition deteriorated rapidly within a few hours. Clear signs of acute abdomen, raised white blood cell count and small gas-fluid levels on abdominal X ray prompted an urgent CT scan of the abdomen. The latter revealed a space occupying lesion arising from the central mesentery containing gas-fluid levels measuring approximately 9 x 9 cm. An urgent exploratory laparotomy was performed. This revealed a mesenteric mass measuring 10 x 10 cm with an abscess. Anatomopathologic investigations showed a mesenteric desmoid tumor. Both colonoscopy and gastroscopy were within normal range ruling out Gardner's syndrome with no polyps or other lesions. The patient made full recovery with radical surgery. This is to our knowledge the fifth case of a desmoid tumor presenting with abdominal abscess not associated with familial adenomatous polyposis. We therefore believe this is an important finding to report."
"To describe imaging characteristics of neuromuscular choristomas (NMC) and to differentiate them from fibrolipomatous hamartomas (FLH). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical and imaging characteristics of six patients with biopsy-proven NMC and six patients with FLH were reviewed by musculoskeletal, a pediatric, and two in-training radiologists with a literature review to define typical magnetic resonance imaging features by consensus. Five radiology trainees blinded to cases and naive to the diagnosis of NMC and a musculoskeletal-trained radiologist rated each lesion as having more than or less than 50% intralesional fat, as well as an overall impression using axial T1 images. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and interobserver agreement kappa were determined. RESULTS: Typical features of NMC include smoothly tapering, fusiform enlargement of the sciatic nerve or brachial plexus elements with T1 and T2 signal characteristics closely following those of muscle. Longitudinal bands of intervening low T1 and T2 signal were often present and likely corresponded to fibrous tissue by pathology. Four of five patients with long-term follow-up (80%) developed aggressive fibromatosis after percutaneous or surgical biopsy. Nerve fascicle thickening often resulted in a ""coaxial cable"" appearance similar to classic FLH, however, using a cutoff of <50% intralesional fat allowed for differentiation with 100% sensitivity by all reviewers and 100% specificity when all imaging features were utilized for impressions. Agreement was excellent with all differentiating methods (kappa 0.861-1.0). CONCLUSIONS: NMC can be confidently differentiated from FLH and malignancies using characteristic imaging and clinical features. When a diagnosis is made, biopsy should be avoided given frequent complication by aggressive fibromatosis."
"Infantile fibromatosis (IF) is a benign, nonmetastasizing but locally aggressive tumor. Pterygomandibular space is deep and obscure, and IF in this space is seldom reported. We describe a typical case of IF in the pterygomandibular space that occurred in a 3-year-old girl. Intraoral incisional biopsy revealed the diagnosis of IF, and surgical resection of the tumor was performed. We intend to heighten the awareness of this tumor and emphasize the pathologic features and identifications of IF and discuss the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. For the high recurrence risk, follow-up with clinical examination and magnetic resonance imaging in pediatric patients is recommended."

"INI1 antigen is a product of the INI-1/SMARCB1 gene localized on chromosome 22q. It is well known that INI1 gene inactivation or loss of INI1 antigen expression is observed in epithelioid sarcomas; however, there are only few reports concerning specificity and sensitivity of immunohistochemical INI1 labeling as a marker of this neoplasm. That is why we decided to test 99 soft tissue sarcomas for the presence of the INI1 gene product. More specifically, the analyzed group consisted of 33 synovial sarcomas, 14 fibrosarcomas, 8 desmoid tumors, 8 DFSPs, 5 MPNSTs, 9 epithelioid sarcomas, 11 Ewing sarcomas/PNETs, 9 rhabdomyosarcomas and 2 clear cell sarcomas. Additionally, 7 malignant melanomas and 9 adenocarcinomas were included into the study. Positive staining with an antibody against the INI-1 gene product was observed in all studied cases of MPNST, Ewing sarcoma/PNET, rhabdomyosarcoma, malignant melanoma, clear cell sarcoma, and adenocarcinoma. On the contrary, none of 9 epithelioid sarcomas was labeled. The loss of INI1 expression was also detected in 7 (21.2%) synovial sarcomas, confirmed cytogenetically or by FISH. Considering the lack of reaction with INI-1 antibody as a diagnostic test for epithelioid sarcoma we estimated that its sensitivity reached 100% and specificity - 83.5% (p < 0.0001)."
"Desmoid tumor is a locally invasive, myofibroblastic, nonmetastatic tumor. Its pathogenesis remains unclear and it may involve genetic abnormalities, sex hormones and traumatic injury, including surgery. Postoperative intra-abdominal desmoid tumor is rare, especially in the retroperitoneum. We report a case of postoperative retroperitoneal desmoid tumor that developed 29 mo after the first excision of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Sporadic trauma-related intra-abdominal desmoid tumors reported in the English literature are also reviewed. Despite an extremely low incidence, postoperative desmoid tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis when a recurrent neoplasm is found at least one year after operation. However, it is a clinical challenge to distinguish recurrent malignant neoplasms from desmoid tumors, and surgical resection is the treatment option depending on the anatomic location."
"Desmoid tumors are neoplastic proliferations of connective tissues. The mutation status of the gene coding for catenin (cadherin-associated protein) beta 1 (CTNNB1) and trisomy 8 on the chromosomal level have been described to have prognostic relevance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In order to elucidate new molecular mechanisms underlying these tumors, we carried out a molecular analysis with a genome-wide human high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, in 9 patients. RESULTS: Single samples showed numerical aberrations on chromosomes (Chrs) 20 and 6 with either trisomy 20 or monosomy 6. No trisomy 8 could be detected. Recurrent heterozygous deletions were found in Chr 5q (including the APC gene locus, n = 3) and Chr 8p23 (n = 4, containing coding regions for the potential tumor suppressor gene CSMD1). This novel deletion in 8p23 showed an association with local recurrence. In addition, structural chromosomal changes (gain of Chrs 8 and 20) were found in a minority of cases. CONCLUSION: The genomic alteration affecting the candidate gene CSMD1 could be important in the development of desmoid tumors."

"A 32-year-old man presented to our department with abdominal pain and fever. In an earlier hospitalization he was diagnosed with periappendicular abscess and treated with antibiotics. Due to fever and 'non-resolution' of the abscess and due to its deep location in the lower abdomen, which excluded percutaneous drainage, we elected to operate the patient. A large mass in the cecum accompanied with an abscess resulted in a right hemicolectomy. The pathological examination revealed a desmoid tumor of the cecum. The patient's recovery was uneventful."
"Screening of Gardner syndrome (GS) patients is tailored towards prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, many patients suffer from desmoid tumors, which are challenging to treat due to invasive growth and local recurrence. The aims of our study were to determine the effectiveness of screening in GS and analyze outcome of desmoid tumors by treatment modality. METHODS: This was a cohort study of a family of 105 descendants with GS. All family members who agreed were screened by endoscopy, and colorectal resection was performed upon pending malignancy. Resectable desmoids were excised, whereas large tumors were treated by a combination of brachytherapy (BT) and radiotherapy (RT). Main outcome measures were the incidence of CRC and overall and disease-specific mortality (ClinicalTrial.gov ID NCT01286662). RESULTS: Thirty-seven of 105 family members have GS. Preventive colorectal resections were performed in 16 patients (15 %), with one death due to gastric cancer. In four patients who denied screening endoscopy, invasive tumors of the colon (three patients) and stomach developed. Of 33 desmoid tumors, 10 (30 %) were located in the mesentery, 17 (52 %) in the abdominal wall, and 6 (18 %) in extra-abdominal sites. Excision of 12 desmoids was performed in eight patients. Four desmoids were treated by BT and RT and showed full or partial remission. CONCLUSIONS: Provided adequate screening, good long-term control of colorectal tumors is achievable. However, desmoid tumors determine survival and quality of life in many patients. Our data suggest good local control using a combination of brachytherapy/radiotherapy in large desmoids unsuitable for surgical resection."

"Desmoid tumors are benign mesenchymal tumors with a strong tendency for local recurrence after surgery. Radiotherapy improves local control following incomplete resection, but nearby organs at risk may limit the dose to the target volume. The patient in this report presented with a recurrent desmoid tumor of the right flank and underwent surgery with microscopically positive margins. Particular problems presented in this case included that the tumor bed was situated in close proximity to the liver and the right kidney and that the right kidney was responsible for 65% of the patient's renal function. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy plans delivering 54 Gy necessarily exposed the right kidney to a V18 of 98% and the liver to a V30 of 55%. Proton therapy plans significantly reduced the right kidney V18 to 32% and the liver V30 to 28%. In light of this, the proton plan was utilized for treatment of this patient. Proton therapy was tolerated without gastrointestinal discomfort or other complaints. Twenty-four months after initiation of proton therapy, the patient is without clinical or radiographic evidence of disease recurrence. In this setting, the improved dose distribution associated with proton therapy allowed for curative treatment of a patient who arguably could not have been safely treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy or other methods of conventional radiotherapy."
"Osteosarcomas rarely occur in older adults. Proteomics has not been reported to date in osteosarcoma occurring in the older adult population. This proteomic investigation was conducted to identify differentially expressed proteins in osteosarcoma occurring in various backgrounds from older adults. Desmoid tumors, known to recur locally but not metastasize, were also analyzed. Protein digests isolated from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue specimen representing 14 primary osteosarcomas of soft tissue and bone and 18 desmoid tumors were analyzed by high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for protein identification and relative quantification by spectral counting. Elevated abundance levels of several proteins including heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), elastin microfibril interface-located protein 1, and clusterin were identified in osteosarcoma with slight differences in proteomic profiles. Desmoids had an abundance of collagen II and periostin only. The findings were confirmed by immunohistochemical staining for HSP90 and clusterin in the experimental samples and additionally in 16 posttherapy conventional osteosarcomas in tissue microarrays constructed from heterogeneous sarcomas and benign lesions. All osteosarcomas were positive for HSP90 and clusterin to a variable extent. One case of well-differentiated parosteal osteosarcoma was negative. Thirty of 75 other high-grade sarcomas including cases of chondrosarcoma were positive for HSP90. Low-grade and benign lesions and scars and 18 desmoid tumors had little or no expression of these proteins. HSP90 and clusterin represent candidate markers of aggressiveness in osteosarcoma occurring in older adults and may be indicative of drug resistance."
"Fibromatosis are proliferations of highly differentiated fibrous tissue. The deep or musculoaponeurotic types of fibromatosis are known as desmoid tumors, aggressive fibromatosis, or desmoid-type fibrosarcoma. It is commonly seen as abdominal tumors; the occurrence of these tumors in maxillofacial region is a rare entity. We report a case of aggressive fibromatosis in a 50-year-old female, who presented with a swelling of the left side of the face. The tumor was extending in to the maxillary antrum which was confirmed as aggressive fibromatosis on histopathological examination. The detailed discussion of etiology, incidence, management and prognosis of the same in corelation with the literature is presented in the article."
"Despite reports of sex steroid receptor and COX2 expression in desmoid-type fibromatosis, responses to single agent therapy with anti-estrogens and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are unpredictable. Perhaps combination pharmacotherapy might be more effective in desmoid tumors that co-express these targets. Clearly, further understanding of the signaling pathways deregulated in desmoid tumors is essential for the development of targeted molecular therapy. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) are important regulators of fibroblast proliferation and matrix deposition, but little is known about the TGFbeta superfamily in fibromatosis. A tissue microarray representing 27 desmoid tumors was constructed; 14 samples of healing scar and six samples of normal fibrous tissue were included for comparison. Expression of selected receptors and activated downstream transcription factors of TGFbeta family signaling pathways, beta-catenin, sex steroid hormone receptors and COX2 were assessed using immunohistochemistry; patterns of co-expression were explored via correlational statistical analyses. In addition to beta-catenin, immunoreactivity for phosphorylated SMAD2/3 (indicative of active TGFbeta signaling) and COX2 was significantly increased in desmoid tumors compared with healing scar and quiescent fibrous tissue. Low levels of phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8 were detected in only a minority of cases. Transforming growth factor-beta receptor type 1 and androgen receptor were expressed in both desmoid tumors and scar, but not in fibrous tissue. Estrogen receptor-beta was present in all cases studied. Transforming growth factor-beta signaling appears to be activated in desmoid-type fibromatosis and phosphorylated SMAD2/3 and COX2 immunoreactivity might be of diagnostic utility in these tumors. Given the frequency of androgen receptor, estrogen receptor-beta and COX2 co-expression in desmoid tumors, further assessment of the efficacy of combination pharmacotherapy using hormonal agonists/antagonists together with COX2 inhibitors should be considered."
"Important advances in fibroblastic and fibrohistiocytic tumors relevant to dermatologists and dermatopathologists include (1) recognition that myxofibrosarcoma is a distinct entity that frequently arises in skin; (2) CD10 is sensitive but not specific atypical fibroxanthoma; (3) neurothekeomas lacking S100 expression are probably fibrohistiocytic/fibroblastic tumors, whereas S100+ myxoid variants are better classified as nerve sheath myxomas; (4) the recognition of a primary cutaneous variant of solitary fibrous tumor; (5) thelimitations of b-catenin immunohistochemistry in desmoid tumors; and (6) the prognostic utility of clinical and histopathologic variables in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, and the effects of imatinib mesylate therapy."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (desmoid) is a fibroblastic tumour that shows locally aggressive growth. Mesenteric desmoid is a rare lesion that shares morphological and biological features with fibromatoses occurring in the abdominal wall or in extraabdominal sites, but differs in terms of gross appearance and clinical presentation. We report on a series of 56 cases of mesenteric desmoids from our consultation files and compare them with cases of non-mesenteric desmoids and retroperitoneal fibrosis. RESULTS: Primary diagnosis of desmoid-type fibromatosis was correct in 42%, and gastrointestinal stromal tumour was a common misdiagnosis. Nuclear expression of beta-catenin was detected in 91.6% of all desmoids. Mutational analysis of exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1) revealed that mesenteric desmoids carried mutations significantly more often (51/56, 91.1%) than non-mesenteric tumours (20/28; 71.4%; P = 0.027). p.T41A occurred significantly more frequently in mesenteric fibromatoses (80.4%) than in abdominal wall and extra-abdominal fibromatoses (46.4%; P = 0.002). Two novel mutations (p.S45C and p.D32G) were found. In retroperitoneal fibrosis, mutations and nuclear beta-catenin expression were absent. beta-Catenin-negative desmoids either carried a CTNNB1 mutation or were associated with Gardner syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence that some clinical and genetic features of mesenteric desmoids differ from those of non-mesenteric fibromatosis, and corroborates the usefulness of mutational analysis, especially in diagnosing beta-catenin-negative mesenteric desmoids."
"Desmoid tumors (DTs) are benign myofibroblastic neoplasms originating from the fascia or muscle aponeurosis, which occur in one-third of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Most FAP-associated DTs occur in the intra-abdominal or abdominal wall region, thus, their infiltrative or expansive growth causes life-threatening organ damage, such as intestinal obstruction, urethral obstruction, and mesenteric infiltration with the involvement of mesenteric vessels. Treatments including surgical resection, cytotoxic chemotherapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anti-estrogen therapy have all been tried with variable success. Here, we report on three patients with FAP who developed multiple intra-abdominal and abdominal wall DTs after total proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Two cases underwent surgical resection of uncontrolled abdominal wall DTs after successful control of intra-abdominal DTs by systemic chemotherapy. The remaining case underwent repeated surgical resections of multiple intra-abdominal and abdominal wall DTs, and consequently had recurrent intra-abdominal DTs, with involvement of the small bowel and ureter. Surgical intervention as tumor volume reduction (cytoreduction) may be useful for cases with medical treatment-refractory or symptomatic FAP-associated abdominal DTs."
"A desmoid tumor, or aggressive fibromatosis, is a benign fibrous tumor with a high potential for locoregional extension. This tumor is very rarely located in the mandible. OBSERVATION: A 2-year-old boy presented with an extensive mandibular desmoid tumor. The diagnosis was proved on histological examination. Two years after surgery, there was no recurrence. DISCUSSION: Aggressive fibromatosis is rarely located in the mandible. The differential diagnosis with malignant tumors is difficult. Surgery is the first-line treatment. However, alternative therapies should be considered, especially in children, to avoid mutilating operations."

"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) is a monoclonal proliferative disease but does not metastasize and does not dedifferentiate to a high-grade malignancy in case of recurrence. Biopsy is usually necessary to confirm the diagnosis. A hallmark is its apparent unpredictable clinical course producing a large heterogeneity even with an indistinguishable morphology. Additional studies of the molecular determinants of desmoid behavior are needed to guide selection of the various therapeutic modalities. During the last 10 years, the treatment of AF has evolved and the role of routine, aggressive first-line treatment (radiotherapy and surgery) is now debated. If a wait-and-see policy is used at initial presentation, it is observed that >50% of patients will have relatively indolent disease. Aggressive treatments that take their indications from retrospective studies should be re-evaluated in the light of new data. The objective of this article is to propose an algorithm that commences with more conservative approaches before treatments that have associated long-term morbidity, the more aggressive therapies being reserved only for those who really need it."
"We report the case of a 57-year-old patient with a huge, retrovesical, aggressive desmoid fibromatosis detected incidentally during preoperative staging for radical prostatectomy. The tumor was locally invasive consisting of monoclonal and fibroblastic proliferations. The etiology of such tumors is not well known but they are mostly sporadic and aggressive fibromatosis is sometimes associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or Gardner's syndrome. Such desmoid tumors are slow growing and locally invasive but lack metastatic potential. Complete resection with wide margins is the therapy of choice and the tendency to recur is high. Radiotherapy following surgery is controversial. We discuss the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and therapy of such rare tumors."
Desmoid tumors are rare neoplasms. They occur mostly in females in their reproductive age and may present with pelvic pain and intestinal obstruction. These connective tissue neoplasms are because of uncontrolled proliferation of differentiated myofibroblasts. The cells may synthesize vast amounts of collagen fibers in response to various stimuli. We describe a case of a pelvic desmoid tumor simulating a uterine leiomyoma recurrence. We review the literature on the epidemiology and the treatment options for desmoid tumors and suggest a strong index of suspicion when a new pelvic mass arises in an adult with previous pelvic surgery. We advise a planned multidisciplinary treatment approach at the first hint of the diagnosis of desmoid tumor.
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a rare tumor of borderline malignancy with a marked local aggressiveness. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment but complete tumor resection is often not easy to achieve without functional and cosmetic sequelae. We report a case of a pretreated child with aggressive fibromatosis who responded to hydroxyurea, avoiding the need for demolitive surgery."
"The surgical approach to masses located in the cervicothoracic juncton represents a challenge for surgeons. Many techniques have been described with good results. METHODS: We analyzed and compared the results obtained in 2 Italian pediatric surgery centers using 2 different techniques in patients with tumors of the thoracic inlet: center 1, using anterior cervical transsternal approach on 7 patients, and center 2, applying ""trap-door"" technique on 5 patients. RESULTS: Excision was incomplete in 5 patients and complete in 7 patients. Histologic examination revealed 5 patients with neuroblastoma; 3, ganglioneuroblastoma; 1, mixoid liposarcoma; 1, desmoid fibromatosis; 1, Castleman disease; and 1, Schwann cell tumor. The median duration of the procedure was 345 minutes in center 1 and 245 minutes in center 2. The median blood loss was 200 mL in both centers. The median hospital stay was 11 days in center 1 and 9 days in center 2. Globally, 5 patients developed postoperative complications. No significant differences were encountered comparing the main surgical outcome parameters between the 2 approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Both techniques resulted in valid options to achieve a safe excision of thoracic inlet masses with a manageable complication rate and acceptable hospital stay. Surgical risk factors should be carefully investigated preoperatively. Postoperative pain control is important to guarantee early recovery."
"Desmoid tumors are rare soft-tissue neoplasms with limited data on their management. We sought to determine the rates of recurrence following surgery for desmoid tumors and identify factors predictive of disease-free survival. METHODS: Between January 1983 and December 2011, 211 patients with desmoid tumors were identified from three major surgical centers. Clinicopathologic and treatment characteristics were analyzed to identify predictors of recurrence. RESULTS: Median age was 36 years; patients were predominantly female (68 %). Desmoid tumors most commonly arose in extremities (32 %), abdominal cavity (23 %) or wall (21 %), and thorax (15 %); median size was 7.5 cm. Most patients had an R0 surgical margin (60 %). The 1- and 5-year recurrence-free survival was 81.3 and 52.8 %, respectively. Factors associated with worse recurrence-free survival were: younger age (for each 5-year increase in age, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.90, 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] 0.82-0.98) and extra-abdominal tumor location (abdominal wall referent: extra-abdominal site, HR = 3.28, 95 % CI, 1.46-7.36) (both P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence remains a problem following resection of desmoid tumors with as many as 50 % of patients experiencing a recurrence within 5 years. Factors associated with recurrence included age, tumor location, and margin status. While surgical resection remains central to the management of patients with desmoid tumors, the high rate of recurrence highlights the need for more effective adjuvant therapies."
"The primary and metastatic gastrointestinal synovial sarcoma is rare with a wide differential diagnosis. It usually expresses cytokeratins EMA, BCL2 with an occasional CD99, and S100 positivity but not desmin. We present a case of metastatic synovial sarcoma with unusual immunophenotype causing diagnostic challenges. The tumor cells showed focal cytokeratin, EMA, and, unexpectedly, desmin positivity. Additional intranuclear TLE-1 positivity and negativity for CD34 and DOG-1 were also identified. A diagnosis of monophasic synovial sarcoma was confirmed by using FISH break-apart probe. RT-PCR revealed the SYT-SSX1 fusion gene. Intra-abdominal synovial sarcoma, either primary or metastatic, with unusual desmin positivity raises the diagnostic challenge, since a wide range of differential diagnoses could show a similar immunophenotype (leiomyosarcoma, desmoid tumor, myofibroblastic tumor, and rarely GIST etc.). Typical morphology and focal cytokeratin/EMA positivity should alert to this tumor, and FISH and RT-PCR remain the gold standard for the confirmation."
"Extra-abdominal desmoid lesions, otherwise known as aggressive fibromatosis, are slow-growing benign lesions which may be encountered in clinical practice. Recent controversies exist regarding their optimal treatment. Given their benign nature, is major debulking surgery justified, or is it worth administering chemotherapy for a disease process which unusually defies common teaching and responds to such medications? We present a literature review of this particular pathology discussing the aetiology, clinical presentation, and various current controversies in the treatment options."
"Desmoid tumors are rare and exhibit a highly unpredictable natural history. We sought to analyze prognostic factors associated with recurrence in a large single-institution study of patients with desmoid tumors. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 177 patients with desmoid tumor who underwent macroscopically complete surgical resection, with or without the addition of radiotherapy (RT) or systemic therapy, from 1970 to 2009. We examined patterns of presentation, all known risk factors for recurrence, and their association with recurrence-free survival (RFS). RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (12 %) had intra-abdominal desmoid tumors, and 155 (88 %) had extra-abdominal tumors. Patterns of presentation included primary (n = 133, 75 %) and locally recurrent (n = 44, 25 %) disease. Treatment was surgery alone in 125 patients (71 %), surgery and RT in 36 (20 %), and surgery and systemic therapy with or without RT in 20 (11 %). Median follow-up was 40 months. Overall, the local relapse rate was 29 %, and 10-year RFS was 60 %. R0 resection status was the only predictor of freedom from local recurrence on multivariate analysis (odds ratio 0.32; 95 % confidence interval 0.15-0.66; P = 0.002). The selective use of adjuvant RT appeared to improve local control in patients with positive margins. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with desmoid tumors undergoing surgery, wide excision with negative margins should be the goal, but not at the expense of function, as fewer than half of patients with positive margins will experience recurrence."
"Desmoid tumors associated with familial adenomatous polyposis show variable behavior; about 10% grow relentlessly, resulting in severe morbidity or mortality. Investigations that could identify the minority of desmoid tumors that behave aggressively would allow these tumors to be treated early and spare the majority of patients who have more benign disease from unnecessary intervention. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether imaging the tumor metabolic-vascular phenotype by modern methods predicts growth. DESIGN: This is a prospective case series study. SETTINGS: The study was conducted at a tertiary center specializing in familial adenomatous polyposis and desmoid disease. PATIENTS: Nine patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (4 male, mean age 39 years) with desmoid tumor underwent 18F-FDG-PET and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. Standard MRI was repeated a year later to assess tumor growth. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measured was the correlation between 18F-FDG-PET and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI parameters and subsequent desmoid growth. RESULTS: Failed intravenous access precluded dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI in 1 female patient. Thirteen desmoid tumors (4 intra-abdominal, 2 extra-abdominal, 7 abdominal wall; mean area, 68 cm) were analyzed in the remaining 8 patients. Two patients died before follow-up MRI. Five tumors decreased in size, 3 increased in size, and 3 remained stable after a year. Significant correlation (Spearman rank correlation, significance at 5%) existed between maximum standardized uptake value and k(ep) (r = -0.56, p = 0.04), but not with other vascular parameters (K(trans) (r = -0.47, p = 0.09); v(e) (r = -0.11, p = 0.72); integrated area under the gadolinium-time curve at 60 seconds (r = -0.47, p = 0.10)). There was no significant difference in the maximum standardized uptake value or dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI parameters (K(trans), v(e), k(ep), integrated area under the gadolinium-time curve at 60 seconds) between the tumors that grew or decreased in size or between the tumor sites. However, vascular metabolic ratio (maximum standardized uptake value/K(trans)) was significantly different for tumor site (p = 0.001) and size (p = 0.001, 1-way ANOVA). LIMITATIONS: This investigation is limited because of its exploratory nature and small patient numbers. CONCLUSIONS: Although not predictive for tumor behavior, some correlations existed between dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and 18F-FDG-PET parameters. Vascular metabolic ratio may provide further information on tumor behavior; however, this needs to be evaluated with further larger studies."
"Surgery is still the standard treatment for aggressive fibromatosis (AF); however, local control remains a significant problem and the impact of R0 surgery on cumulative recurrence (CR) is objective of contradictory reports. METHODS: This is a single-institution study of 62 consecutive patients affected by extra-abdominal and intra-abdominal AF who received macroscopically radical surgery within a time period of 15 years. RESULTS: Definitive pathology examination confirmed an R0 situation in 49 patients and an R1 in 13 patients. Five-year CR for patients who underwent R0 vs R1 surgery was 7.1% vs 46.4% (P = 0.04) and for limbs vs other localizations 33.3% vs 9.9% (P = 0.02) respectively. In 17 patients who had intraoperative frozen section (IFS) margin evaluation R0 surgery was more common (17 of 17 vs 32 of 45, P = 0.01) and CR lower (five-year CR 0% vs 19.1%, respectively, P = 0.04). However, in multivariate analysis only limb localization showed a negative impact on CR (HR: 1.708, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.84, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: IFS evaluation could help the surgeon to achieve R0 surgery in AF. Non-surgical treatment, including watchful follow-up, could be indicated for patients with limb AF localization, because of their high risk of recurrence even after R0 surgery."

"Background. Only limited data are available concerning desmoid tumor in children. Methods. Fifty-nine children and adolescents with desmoid tumor treated in 2 French cancer centers with a very long followup were retrospectively reviewed. Results. Median age was 6 years (range, 0-15). Tumors mainly involved the limbs (42%). Five cases occurred in a context of genetic disorder. Surgery was first-line treatment in 80% of cases. Resection was microscopically complete in 3 patients (pts), with a microscopic residue in 19 pts and a macroscopic residue in 35 cases. Various adjuvant therapies were used. Overall response to all systemic therapies was 33%. Thirty-eight patients developed one or more recurrences or progressions. After a median followup of 8.5 years, 34 patients were alive in complete remission (CR), including 16 first CR. Seven patients died, 6 from refractory disease and 1 from colorectal carcinoma in a genetic context. Ten-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival were 31% and 88%, respectively. In univariate analysis, age less than 10 years and head-neck site were favorable prognostic factors for PFS. Conclusions. When surgery is required, surgical margins must be negative. Low-dose chemotherapy can be proposed as adjuvant therapy. Prospective trials must be developed to evaluate long-term response and side effects."
A case of aggressive juvenile ossifying fibroma in a child has been discussed. The unique appearance of this particular lesion demonstrates a close relationship between aggressive ossifying fibroma and well-differentiated osteogenic sarcoma. The age of the patient and the location of the tumor in the case presented made it mandatory to utilize multiple diagnostic parameters and adjunctive diagnostic help to resolve the dilemma posed by this tumor. Differentiation of ossifying fibroma from other benign and malignant neoplasms as well as fibrous dysplasia is important in correct management of the lesion.
"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) or desmoid tumor of the head and neck region is a rare, usually unresectable, benign soft tissue tumor with locally aggressive behavior. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 31-year-old woman presented with a progressive trismus, a swelling in the retromandibular area, as well as loss of sensibility of the maxillary and mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. MRI of the head and neck revealed an infiltrative mass involving the masticator, parapharyngeal, and prevertebral and paravertebral space on the left with intracranial extension through the orbital fissure. After the fifth biopsy, 15 months after presentation, the diagnosis of AF was made. The tumor was unresectable, so intensity-modulated radiotherapy was given with curative intent using a total dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions of 2 Gy. After 16 months, she showed progressive disease, for which tamoxifen 40 mg twice daily was started with a good response for 2 years. After that, she started with sorafinib, on which she has stable disease now. CONCLUSION: The often long delay in proper diagnosis and the treatment challenges of a desmoid tumor are illustrated in this case. Furthermore, this article reviews the literature concerning AF, especially of the head and neck region."
"Dynamic PET (dPET) studies with 18F-FDG were performed in patients with unresectable aggressive fibromatosis before imatinib therapy. The goal of the study was to evaluate the impact of regression-based parametric imaging on tumor diagnostics. A comparison between the regression-based quantitative data (slope and intercept values) with the compartmental data of FDG was performed. METHODS: The evaluation includes 24 patients with recurrent disease (n = 14), residual tissue (n = 2), or primary disease (n = 8), who were scheduled for palliative treatment with imatinib. Parametric images were calculated based on the dPET data by fitting a linear regression function to the time-activity data and for each voxel. Images of the slope and the intercept of the time-activity data were calculated using a dedicated software. A volume-of-interest-based analysis was also performed by applying a 2-tissue compartment model to the dPET data. The resulting parameters of the FDG kinetics [blood volume (VB), k1-k4] were compared with the volume-of-interest-based slope and intercept data. The evaluation of the parametric images was performed visually and quantitatively. RESULTS: Twenty of 24 tumors could be visualized in the SUV images with a moderate uptake, in locations that were already known from the MR images. Most (16/24) of the tumors demonstrated a clear enhancement in the intercept images, whereas 4 of them showed an intermediate enhancement and only 4 did not show any enhancement in the intercept images. In contrast, only 10 of 24 tumors demonstrated a clearly enhanced slope, 3 of them revealed a slightly enhanced slope, and 11 of the 24 patients did not demonstrate any slope enhancement within the area of the known desmoid tumors. The comparison of slope revealed the highest correlation to the SUV (r = 0.56, P < 0.05), whereas the intercept values demonstrated the highest correlation to k1 (r = 0.794, P < 0.05), followed by the fractional VB (r = 0.709, P < 0.05), followed by SUV (r = 0.630, P < 0.05). The results indicate that slope images are related to the transport/phosphorylation-dependent part of FDG, whereas intercept images are related to the transport/perfusion part of FDG. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the use of regression-based parametric imaging helps to differentiate between transport/perfusion- and transport/phosphorylation-dependent FDG uptake and demonstrate that the transport/phosphorylation rate is low in most of these tumors."
"Surgical options for familiar adenomatous polyposis (FAP) have been standardized in developed countries but are still controversial in China. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the results of patients with FAP treated in a university hospital. METHODS: In all 42 consecutive patients with FAP were operated on between May 1988 and June 2008. Median follow up was 7.2 years (2.2-20 years). Of these 33 patients were treated by proctocolectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis. A total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis was undertaken in six and a proctocolectomy with ileostomy in three patients who had invasive rectal cancer. RESULTS: Postoperative morbidity was insignificant. There were five wound infections, one intestinal obstruction, one anastomotic leakage, one anastomotic stenosis and one refractory pouchitis. One patient died from stroke. Five died from FAP-related disorders, namely, abdominal desmoids, liver metastases and advanced rectal cancer. Desmoid tumor occurred in five patients. Periampullary adenoma and carcinoma developed in four patients. In those with pouch procedure the 24-h bowel movement was 7.14 +/- 1.28 (range 5-11) and their 10-year overall survival was 87.5%. CONCLUSION: A proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis maybe the best choice for FAP patients in China. Surgical expertise, good teamwork and careful long-term follow up are mandatory."
"The major changes to the 2012 and 2011 NCCN Guidelines for Soft Tissue Sarcoma pertain to the management of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and desmoid tumors (aggressive fibromatosis). Postoperative imatinib following complete resection for primary GIST with no preoperative imatinib is now included as a category 1 recommendation for patients with intermediate or high risk of recurrence. The panel also reaffirmed the recommendation for preoperative use of imatinib in patients with GISTs that are resectable with negative margins but associated with significant surgical morbidity. Observation was included as an option for patients with resectable desmoid tumors that are small and asymptomatic, not causing morbidity, pain, or functional limitation. Sorafenib is included as an option for systemic therapy for patients with desmoid tumors."

"Fibromatosis in the maxillofacial region is a very rare occurrence among diverse pathologic conditions, and because of the rarity of this tumor, definite treatment regimen is not established, which may be a contributing factor for a high recurrence rate. Fibromatosis may attain a large size and cause compression, infiltration, and destruction of adjacent structures. Such growth behavior presents severe management problems, especially in the head and neck region, where the presence of many vital structures within a small space makes the patient susceptible to the effects of the fibromatosis, likewise making complete excision difficult. We report the case of a 28-year-old female patient with aggressive desmoid fibromatosis involving the mandible, with a literature review of postoperative pharmacologic management to prevent recurrence."
"An abdominal wall desmoid tumor is a rare event, has a strong tendency for local invasion and recurrence, and usually presents as an abdominal lump. CASE: A 35-year-old multiparous woman presented with a painful abdominal lump that had been slowly increasing in size. The pain was not associated with menstruation. Clinical examination, ultrasonography, and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging were performed and suggested a large, sharply defined mass measuring approximately 11 x 7.1 cm in the right anterolateral abdominal wall. There was no family history of familial adenomatous polyposis. The mass was excised and sent for histopathologic examination, which indicated abdominal wall desmoid tumor. CONCLUSION: Abdominal wall desmoid tumors can be diagnostic dilemmas and should be considered in the differential diagnosis for lumps in the abdomen in women."

"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is an uncommon and aggressive neoplasia, associated with a high rate of recurrence. It is characterized by an infiltrative but benign fibroblastic proliferation occurring within the deep soft tissues. There is no consensus about the treatment of those tumors. We present a surgical series of four cases, involving the brachial plexus (two cases), the median nerve and the medial brachial cutaneous nerve. Except for the last case, they were submitted to multiple surgical procedures and showed repeated recurrences. The diagnosis, the different ways of treatment and the prognosis of these tumoral lesions are discussed. Our results support the indication of radical surgery followed by radiotherapy as probably one of the best ways to treat those controversial lesions."
"Desmoid tumours have a strong tendency for local invasion and recurrence. A 70 year-old male presented with cervical and left shoulder pain associated with a supraclavicular mass. The computed-tomography showed an expansive lesion measuring 10 cm x 6 cm x 5.5 cm in the left supraclavicular space. At magnetic resonance imaging the subclavian vessels and the brachial plexus were dislocated anteriorly but not infiltrated. An incisional biopsy suggested a desmoid tumour. An anterior cervicothoracic approach was used to remove the tumour. The chest wall was reconstructed with titanium bars and a polytetrafluoroethylene-patch. The clavicle was fixed using a titanium clip. The post-operative course was uneventful. The patient was treated with adjuvant radiation therapy. After six months the patient is in good clinical condition free from disease recurrence. In conclusion, desmoid tumour of the thoracic outlet is a challenging situation. Wide radical resection should be attempted whenever possible. The Dartevelle approach gives an optimal surgical field with direct control of vessels and nerve roots facilitating tumour dissection and radical resection en-bloc with the chest wall. The chest wall reconstruction with titanium bars and clips is a simple and effective method to guarantee good respiratory function and to stabilise the shoulder girdle."

A comparative morphological study of primary and relapsing desmoid tumors was carried out. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the progress of desmoid tumors in the form of relapses was paralleled by an increase in the counts of immunopositive cells and intensity of beta-catenin and cycloxygenase-2 expression.
"Desmoid tumors are one of the most common extracolonic manifestations of the familial adenomatous polyposis. However, other soft tissue tumors are seen rarely in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, including gastrointestinal stromal tumor. There is only one case reported in the literature. We describe a 29-year-old female who developed ileal malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor 15 months after proctocolectomy for familial adenomatous polyposis, with a review of the literature focusing on sarcomas arising in this inherited disease. We suggest that the rare occurrence of gastrointestinal stromal tumor in familial adenomatous polyposis does not exclude their consideration in the differential diagnosis of extracolonic manifestations of the disease."
"Radical tumor resection and immediate lower abdominal wall reconstruction in patients with aggressive neoplasm invading full-thickness abdominal wall are challenging because of their close proximity and possible invasion to bone and great vessels, as well as consequent giant defect. METHODS: Data on 16 patients were reviewed retrospectively. Radical neoplasm resection and immediate abdominal wall reconstruction using the combined technique of intraperitoneal mesh placement, sublay technique, pedicled great omentum flap, and rotation skin graft were performed. RESULTS: Sixteen patients underwent radical abdominal wall neoplasm resection, achieving clear margin of >3 cm. The mean size of consequent giant defect was 226.5 +/- 65.5 cm(2), with a mean polypropylene mesh size of 160.7 +/- 40.5 cm(2) and a mean compound mesh size of 330.8 +/- 100.2 cm(2). Sixteen patients had a mean follow-up duration of 32.5 +/- 12.5 months. Four patients developed incisional infections, and 1 patient died of several metastatic lesions 24 months postoperatively. No ventral hernia and abdominal wall recurrence were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Radical neoplasm resection and immediate abdominal wall reconstruction are appropriate for patients with aggressive neoplasm in the lower abdominal wall."
"A desmoid tumor, also known as aggressive fibromatosis, is a rare benign neoplasm that arises from fascial or musculoaponeurotic tissues. It can occur in any anatomical location, most commonly the abdominal wall, shoulder girdle and retroperitoneum. The typical clinical presentation is a painless mass with a slow and progressive invasion of contiguous structures. It is associated with a high local recurrence rate after resection. Many issues regarding the optimal treatment of desmoid tumors remain controversial. Aggressive surgical resection with a wide margin (2-3 cm) remains the gold standard treatment with regard to preserving quality of life. Radiotherapy alone has been shown to be effective for the control of unresectable or recurrent lesions. Desmoid tumors tend to be locally infiltrative, therefore, the fields must be generous to prevent marginal recurrence. The radiation dose appropriate for treating desmoid tumors remains controversial. We present a 25-year-old Caucasian man with local recurrence of a desmoid tumor after repeated surgical resection, treated with radiotherapy. The patient achieved complete tumor regression at 4 mo after radiotherapy, and he is clinically free of disease at 12 mo after the end of treatment, with an acceptable quality of life. The patient developed short bowel syndrome as a complication of second surgical resection. Consequently, radiotherapy might have worsened an already present malabsorption and so led to steatohepatitis."

"In female patients presenting a tumor of the lower abdominal wall especially after cesarian section, an endometriotic tumor as well as an aggressive desmoid tumor should be considered. Symptoms in correlation with the monthly period can facilitate the presurgical differentiation between endometriosis and fibromatosis. Ultrasound reveals the typical location of both tumors and its remarkable sonographic appearance. In the clinical practice, the desmoid fibromatosis of the lower abdominal wall is a very rare disease. We present a case of a 25-year-old pregnant and discuss diagnostic and therapeutic options by a PubMed literature review. With the knowledge of the prognosis of the desmoid fibromatosis and the respective treatment options including wait and see, complete surgical resection with macroscopically free margins and adjuvant approaches is essential to avoid further interventions and progression of the locally destructive tumor."
"in (i) 260 cases of typical desmoid tumors; and (ii) in 191 cases of spindle cell lesions, which can morphologically 'mimic' desmoid tumors. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were obtained via core needle biopsy (n=150) or open biopsy/surgical excision (n=301). Only 16 cases (4%) were not analyzable (Bouin's fixed tissue). CTNNB1 mutations were observed in 223 of 254 (88%) of sporadic desmoid tumors. No CTNNB1 mutations were detected in all other lesions (n=175) studied. CTNNB1 sequencing can be easily and reliably done using tissues obtained via core needle biopsy. Detection of CTNNB1 mutations in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues among spindle cell lesions is proposed as a specific diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of desmoid tumors. This result has significant implications for patient care and management."

"Desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) is a rare soft tissue tumor with fibroblastic features affecting two to four individuals per million population per year. Despite its bland microscopic appearance, the tumor behaves aggressively. Although unable to metastasize, DTF tends to recur and local recurrences in anatomically critical sites can be fatal. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) play an important role in tumor development through the activation of angiogenesis, particularly in cases of epithelial malignancies. The aim of this study is to investigate the prognostic significance of TAMs and the number of microvessels in DTF. Tumor macrophages (CD163), microvessel density (CD31), and beta-catenin were investigated on 69 primary DTF cases with follow-up information. CTNNB1 mutations were also studied. High density of tumor macrophages and high number of microvessels were associated with a significantly worse recurrence-free survival (P = 0.03 and P = 0.007, respectively). There was a significant correlation between microvessel density and CD163 macrophages (P = 0.02). Furthermore, combination of high number of tumor macrophages and high microvessel density greatly improved the statistical significance (P = 0.000005). Macrophages and microvessels may play an important role in the biologic behavior of DTF. This finding could help in the clinical management of patients with DTF."

"Familial adenomatous polyposis-related desmoid tumors can present with a liquefied center containing gas, accompanied by abdominal pain and sepsis. To date the optimal management of such patients has not been documented. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review our experience of managing these desmoids grouped together as ""intra-abdominal desmoids with air-fluid level"" and present a management algorithm. DESIGN: This is a retrospective study of prospectively maintained polyposis registry database. SETTING: This study was conducted at a tertiary referral center specializing in familial adenomatous polyposis and desmoid disease. PATIENTS: Nine patients with intra-abdominal desmoid and air-fluid level were analyzed for the purpose of this study. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-six patients were identified with desmoid tumor. Of these, a total of 9 patients had an intra-abdominal desmoid with air-fluid level; 7 were women. Age range at diagnosis was 20 to 41 years. The median time from primary surgery to desmoid tumor development was 24 months (range, 0-48 months), and the median time for further progression to air-fluid level was 24 months (range, 0-226 months). Desmoid tumor size ranged from 10 cm to greater than 20 cm in diameter. Two patients were successfully managed with antibiotics alone, and 2 patients were managed with percutaneous drainage and antibiotics. The other 5 patients required surgical intervention involving either excision or drainage with or without proximal defunctioning/exclusion. There was a single 30-day mortality. LIMITATION: This study was limited by the small number of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of intra-abdominal desmoids with an air-fluid level require surgical intervention. Antibiotics and percutaneous drainage are only successful in a limited number of patients. We present our current treatment algorithm based on this experience."
"Larger thoracic defects require stable yet flexible reconstruction to prevent flail chest and debilitating respiratory impairment. We present the use of locking rib-spanning plates as a chest salvage procedure. METHODS: A 30-year-old male presented with a massive desmoid tumor in the posterolateral aspect of the chest wall. The mass measured 22 by 14 by 6 cm and involved the posterior third through seventh ribs. The patient underwent wide excision and reconstruction in layers with a porcine dermal substitute for the pleura, locking rib-spanning plates for structural support, and coverage with ipsilateral latissimus dorsi. RESULTS: The patient tolerated the procedure without complication. He was extubated on postoperative day zero and has had an uneventful course. CONCLUSION: Chest wall reconstruction with rib-spanning plates is an alternative method of reconstruction for large chest wall defects. This method limits the foreign body burden while providing rigid structural support. This technique also makes chest wall reconstruction possible in situations that might previously have been treated with pneumonectomy."
"Mesenteric aggressive fibromatosis, also known as abdominal desmoid tumor (DT), is a rare monoclonal neoplasm arising from muscoloaponeurotic structures, caused by a generalized defect in growth regulation of the connective tissue. Childhood abdominal DT is very rare (1), and the mesenteric localization is one of the rarest forms (approximately 5% of total cases). Despite its benign microscopic appearance and nonmetastasizing behavior, abdominal DT shows a high risk of recurrence (30%-80%) (2) and local aggressive growth. We report a case of a 7-year-old girl with a giant mesenteric fibromatosis, with multiple recurrence after surgical resections, successfully treated with low-dose of vinblastine (3-6 mg/m(2) per week) and methotrexate (20-30 mg/m(2) per week) for 24 months (every 7 days for 11 months and every 2 weeks for the last 13 months). After a follow-up of 47 months from the end of treatment, the child is in good health and in complete remission. Prolonged therapy with low-dose methotrexate and vinblastine appears to control abdominal DT and is associated with stable disease in patients with tumor unresponsive to surgery."
"Background. Magnetic resonance imaging is considered as imaging modality of choice in diagnosis of desmoid tumors, though even this technique can lack the ability to distinguish aggressive fibromatosis from other benign or malignant soft tissue tumors. The aim of this study was to investigate if desmoid tumors would show an adequate tracer uptake in somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and moreover to correlate these results with immunohistochemical staining. Patients and Methods. Thirteen patients with desmoid tumors were examined with somatostatin receptor scintigraphy. Additionally, seven of these patients have been tested for the immunohistochemical expression of somatostatin receptor subtype 2A. The results of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and the results of immunohistochemical staining (somatostatin receptor subtype 2A) were evaluated and correlated. Results. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy revealed that eight of 13 affected patients (62%) showed an enhanced tracer uptake. On the other hand, the correlation between the results of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and immunohistochemical investigations was poor (two out of seven cases). Conclusion. The current study demonstrated that desmoid tumors frequently express somatostatin receptor subtype 2, while immunohistochemical investigations did not correlate with these findings. This may likely be due to lack of standardization of this technique and also due to heterogeneous receptor distribution within the tumors."
"Fibroproliferative disorders include neoplastic and reactive processes (e.g. desmoid tumor and hypertrophic scars). They are characterized by activation of beta-catenin signaling, and effective pharmacologic approaches are lacking. Here we undertook a high throughput screen using human desmoid tumor cell cultures to identify agents that would inhibit cell viability in tumor cells but not normal fibroblasts. Agents were then tested in additional cell cultures for an effect on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and beta-catenin protein level. Ultimately they were tested in Apc1638N mice, which develop desmoid tumors, as well as in wild type mice subjected to full thickness skin wounds. The screen identified Neofopam, as an agent that inhibited cell numbers to 42% of baseline in cell cultures from beta-catenin driven fibroproliferative disorders. Nefopam decreased cell proliferation and beta-catenin protein level to 50% of baseline in these same cell cultures. The half maximal effective concentration in-vitro was 0.5 uM and there was a plateau in the effect after 48 hours of treatment. Nefopam caused a 45% decline in tumor number, 33% decline in tumor volume, and a 40% decline in scar size when tested in mice. There was also a 50% decline in beta-catenin level in-vivo. Nefopam targets beta-catenin protein level in mesenchymal cells in-vitro and in-vivo, and may be an effective therapy for neoplastic and reactive processes driven by beta-catenin mediated signaling."
"Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) are mesenchymal neoplasms of fibroblastic origin, most commonly found in the pleura. Numerous extrathoracic locations have been reported during the last 2 decades. Herein, we report the first case of an SFT in the round ligament of the liver. A 46-year-old Caucasian man presented with a 12-month history of abdominal pain. An ultrasonography-guided microbiopsy first revealed a desmoid tumor. After failure of first- and second-line medical treatments (celecoxib and tamoxifen, then imatinib), histological reexamination was suspicious for a low-grade sarcoma. MRI was also suspicious for a malignant process. Hence, surgery was decided. Laparotomy found a huge and well-limited tumor that, unexpectedly, was appended to the round ligament of the liver and free from any other intra-abdominal contact. The tumor was easily removed. Excision was monobloc and macroscopically complete. Histological analysis diagnosed an SFT arising from the round ligament of the liver. No adjuvant treatment was given. Ten months after surgery, the patient is alive without any signs or symptoms of relapse. This is the first report of SFT arising from the round ligament of the liver. It illustrates the difficulty in diagnosing such tumors. Whilst diagnosis of SFT is rare, it should be kept in mind to allow early diagnosis and complete surgical resection, which provide the best chance for recovery."
"Desmoid tumor is a rare, benign soft tissue tumor having potential for local invasion. It commonly arises in abdominal wall, presenting as a palpable mass. We describe a case of thoracic desmoid tumor in a middle aged male arising from the chest wall. Unlike the usual presentation, two separate non-palpable tumor masses protruded into left thoracic cavity mimicking lung carcinoma. The patient underwent successful complete surgical excision of the tumor. Such tumors, being rare, may pose diagnostic problems if not considered in the initial work up."
"A 66-year-old Caucasian male was admitted following symptoms of intermittent umbilical pain aggravated after meals and associated with vomiting of contents. Physical examination revealed a tender, partially reducible swelling suspicious of complicated umbilical hernia. Abdominal x-ray revealed dilated small bowel loops which appeared consistent with clinical diagnosis. He underwent a laparotomy subsequently which revealed a small defect in the linea alba with viable small bowel and two firm mesenteric masses encroaching the lumen approximately two feet from the ileocaecal junction. The histology of the excised bowel and masses revealed that the tumour composed of bland spindle cells with slender to plump nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mesenteric fibromatosis are the most common primary tumours of the mesentery and constitute about 3.5% of all fibrous tissue tumours. Intra-abdominal desmoids are very rare and benign tumours but are very aggressive and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain."

"We report on a 41-year-old woman with a chest wall desmoid tumour who was successfully treated with a computed tomography (CT)-guided steroid injection. She presented with a palpable mass in the right upper chest wall and was treated by surgical excision and postoperative radiation therapy due to recurrence of the mass at the surgical site. At 20 months after the second operation, a recurrent mass was again detected in the anterosuperior portion of the previous surgical site on CT. We performed a CT-guided steroid injection weekly for 4 weeks by applying a mixture of 3 mL of triamcinolone acetonide (40 mg/mL) and 3 mL of 1% Lidocaine, administering 4-6 mL of the mixture, to the lesion. Six months later, CT showed a marked decrease in the size of the mass."
"Pediatric aggressive fibromatosis (AF) is a rare, benign tumor with locally infiltrative growth. Therefore, how to prevent reoccurrence while maintaining the mandible contour and continuity as much as possible is very important when the mandible is involved. PROCEDURE: We selected 10 pediatric patients with AF involving the mandible in our department between January 2001 and December 2011. Patient clinical data, including patient characteristics, symptoms at presentation, management, and treatment outcome, were reviewed. RESULTS: Patients' ages ranged from 3 to 16 years with six males and four females. According to imaging, there were three cases where the tumor adhered to the mandible; the periosteum was resected with the tumor, followed by cryotherapy or cauterization. Another five cases involved the destruction of the periosteum and the cortical plate. Resection of the involved mandible with the tumor was performed, and the margin was trimmed. In the last two cases, the tumor had invaded the whole ramus, and the immediate iliac graft was operated on after resecting the lesions. Neither radiotherapy (RT) nor chemotherapy was used. There was no recurrence or contour defect of the face. The function of the mandible was not affected, and only one case showed a slight limitation when opening the mouth. CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of pediatric AF, we recommend complete tumor resection. As for the involved mandible, preserving the mandible contour and continuity as much as possible and providing adjunctive therapy, such as cryotherapy or cauterization, are vital. RT is not recommended."
"Surgical treatment of thoracic inlet tumors represents a challenge to the surgeon due to its location and anatomical elements contained in that region. Several surgical approaches have been proposed, each of them showing some advantages but drawbacks as well. In our opinion, the anterior transmanubrial approach described in 1997 is one of the most convenient. The objective of this paper is to describe and comment on some technical aspects of the procedure in order to aid surgeons who intend to perform this surgical approach. Moreover, we show our results in five patients and also comment on other approaches in this pathology."
"A 24-year-old man presented with a solid swelling of the right hemi scrotum at the urological out-patient unit. Ultrasound and CT-scan showed a herniation in the scrotum in which a solid mass was visible. After surgical resection and pathological examination it was determined to be a desmoid tumor, either of intra-abdominal origin having herniated through the inguinal annulus, or originating from a previously herniated omentum in the scrotum. Adjuvant chemotherapy, due to the limited added value and the possible consequences for fertility."
"The clinical picture of desmoids is unpredictable, which is a feature of different tumor specific associations. Anatomic location, age, sex, association with FAP as well as other factors determine biological behavior of the tumor. Negative prognosis is linked with the intraabdominal area and as many as 80% of desmoids are associated with FAP. Currently, biological targeting therapy is used in the treatment of many cancer diseases. It is only the question of time when and by which of these therapies we will be able to treat the patients with aggressive fibromatosis as well. A disadvantage is heterogenity and rare occurrence of desmoids. The efficacy of tailoring treatment still depends on knowledge and study of particular disease biological markers, which is currently the most important issue. ."
"Aggressive fibromatosis, also known as desmoid tumor, is specific and relatively rarely occuring disease. It belongs to heterogenous group of soft tissue tumors. Originally, it arises from fibroblasts with monoclonal proliferation derived from fibro-aponeurotic tissue with typical local invasive spreading without metastatic tendency. Increased amount of knowledge about the role of the APC gene and its protein product in FAP play an important role in revealing the molecular nature of desmoid tumors. In general, we can conclude that the beta-catenin dysregulation is the key player of the FAP associated desmoid tumor onset. The Wingless/Wnt cascade plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of aggressive fibromatosis. However, it has not been definitely proven that the mutations of APC or beta-catenin genes are the trigger mechanisms. The research outcome can pave the way for using target biological therapy in routine practice in patients with aggressive fibromatosis in the future."
"Calretinin is an intracellular calcium-binding EF-hand protein of the calmodulin superfamily. It plays a role in diverse cellular functions, including message targeting and intracellular calcium signaling. It is expressed in the mesothelium, mast cells, some neural cells, and fat cells, among others. Because of its relative specificity for mesothelial neoplasms, calretinin is widely used as one of the primary immunohistochemical markers for malignant mesothelioma and in differentiating it from adenocarcinoma. On the basis of our sporadic observation on calretinin immunoreactivity in desmoid fibromatosis, we systematically evaluated calretinin, keratin cocktail (AE1/AE3), and WT1 immunoreactivity in 268 fibroblastic/myofibroblastic neoplasms. Calretinin was observed in 75% (44/58) of desmoid fibromatosis, 50% (21/42) of proliferative fasciitis, 23% (8/35) of nodular fasciitis, 33% (13/40) of benign fibrous histiocytoma, 35% (22/62) of malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and 13% (4/31) of solitary fibrous tumors but not in normal connective tissue fibroblasts at various sites. Keratin AE1/AE3 immunoreactivity was also commonly (6/13) present in the large ganglion-like cells of proliferative fasciitis and sometimes in nodular fasciitis (3/35), solitary fibrous tumor (3/27), and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (9/62). Nuclear immunoreactivity for WT1 or keratin 5 positivity was not detected in myofibroblastic tumors. On the basis of these observations, it can be concluded that calretinin and focal keratin immunoreactivity is fairly common in benign and malignant fibroblastic and myofibroblastic lesions. Calretinin-positive and keratin-positive spindle cells in desmoid and nodular fasciitis or calretinin-positive ganglion-like cells in proliferative fasciitis should not be confused with elements of epithelioid or sarcomatoid mesothelioma. These diagnostic pitfalls can be avoided with careful observation of morphology, quantitative differences in keratin expression, and use of additional immunohistochemical markers such keratin 5 and WT1 to verify true epithelial and mesothelial differentiation typical of mesothelioma."

"Desmoid tumors are rare mesenchymal neoplasms without metastatic potential. Despite the benign nature of this condition, some patients develop disease progression despite all locoregional options for care. Aggressive forms of desmoid tumors may induce morbidity that can lead to physical impairment and mortality that is occasionally observed as a result of local infiltrative growth and tissue invasion, in particular with abdominal disease. Few therapeutic options are available for patients with recurrent/unresectable desmoid tumors. Several studies have suggested the potential benefit of antiestrogens such as tamoxifen in this setting. Here we report the first description of the efficacy of an aromatase inhibitor in a patient with a desmoid tumor."
"To evaluate the clinic manifestation, pathologic behavior, therapy and prognosis of rare aggressive fibromatosis in the head and neck. METHOD: Two cases of aggressive fibromatosis were analyzed and relevant literatures were reviewed. RESULT: Aggressive fibromatosis was characterized as infiltrative, locally aggressive and tended to recur after surgical resection. Pathology showed fibroblastic monoclonal proliferation. Fibromatosis was composed of well-differentiated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, lacking cytological features of malignancy and scanty or absent mitotic activity. Complete surgical excision of aggressive fibromatosis was considered to be the only effective method of cure by most authorities. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be used together with surgery in recurrence or unsatisfactory surgical margin. In our study, one patient recurred after the first operation, and after another operation, the patient did not recur after 6 months follow up, and the other one did not recur after 6 months follow up. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of aggressive fibromatosis depended on pathological examination. Radical removal was an important way to reduce recurrence rate. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy can be used as adjuvant therapy in patients with recurrent or unresectable or inoperable disease."
"The scapular osteocutaneous flap can be used for the reconstruction of a variety of head and neck defects. In this study, we describe use of the reverse-flow scapular osteocutaneous flap in the setting of a vessel-depleted neck. METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective review of patients who underwent scapular osteocutaneous free flap reconstruction over a 5-year period revealed 3 patients who underwent reverse-flow osteocutaneous scapular flaps. Indications for surgery included a large recurrent desmoid tumor of the mandible, recurrent alveolar ridge carcinoma, and osteoradionecrosis. All patients had a history of neck dissection and radiotherapy. Exploration of the contralateral neck was required to identify recipient vessels in all cases. Arterial and venous anastomoses were performed to the distal end of the thoracodorsal artery and subscapular vein, respectively, and no vein grafts were required. There were no cases of flap failures or donor site complications. CONCLUSION: This series demonstrates the safety and efficacy of the reverse flow osteocutaneous flap for complex mandibular reconstruction in cases where recipient vessels are limited."
"Fibromatosis is a kind of spindle cell tumor which is characterized by the remarkable proliferation and invasive growth of fibrous tissue. It often arises from the abdominal wall or the extremities and rarely from the mesentery and abdominal organs. The patient was 35 year old female whose major complaints were an abdominal mass and pain. She underwent a right hemicolectomy after the tumor was confirmed by abdominal ultrasonography and computerized tomography. Hereby the pathophysiology, diagnosis and the treatment of the disease is discussed."
"To review the outcomes of patients with extra-abdominal fibromatosis treated at a tertiary referral centre. METHODS: A retrospective review of a series of 72 patients with fibromatosis treated at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital (RNOH) between 1980 and 2009, with a median follow up of 4 years (1-17 years). RESULTS: Forty patients were primary referrals, and 32 more had operations at the referring hospital. Five were treated non-operatively; 48 patients were treated by operation alone and 19 patients underwent surgery supplemented by adjuvant therapy. Recurrence was seen in 24 of the operation alone group and 10 in the operation and adjuvant therapy group. The rate of recurrence was lower with complete excision. However, complete excision was impossible in some cases because of extension into the chest or spinal canal, or involvement with the axial vessels and lumbosacral or brachial plexus. CONCLUSION: We suggest that operative excision should seek to preserve function and that supplementary adjuvant therapy may reduce the risk of recurrence, although excision margin appears to be the most important factor. The aggressive, infiltrative behaviour of deep fibromatoses and the associated genetic mutations identified, clearly distinguish them from the superficial fibromatoses and makes their treatment more difficult and dangerous, especially where vital structures are involved."

"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a rare syndrome characterized by the presence of hundreds to thousands of colorectal adenomas and is responsible for less than 1% of all colorectal cancers. The syndrome is also characterized by extra-colorectal features including amongst others upper gastrointestinal tract polyps and desmoid tumors. The syndrome is inherited by an autosomal dominant gene, the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. We present the physical history, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of a patient with a novel germline APC mutation, the W421X mutation, which resulted in FAP presenting with about a hundred colorectal polyps, gastric hyperplastic polyps and multiple aggressive intra-abdominal and extra-abdominal desmoid tumors."

"Extra-abdominal desmoid tumors are known as aggressive fibromatosis (AFM). Synchronous and metachronous multicentric aggressive fibromatosis are rare lesions and pose dilemma in diagnosis and management. A rare and interesting case of recurrent multicentric, synchronous AFM is presented which to the best of our knowledge has not been reported earlier. A young male presented with well defined, hard, fixed swelling on the thigh. Resected tumor mass on histopathology was diagnosed as an extra abdominal fibromatosis. He presented again after two months with swelling at the same site; and two more swellings on the foot. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) from all three sites was performed; and was suggestive of benign spindle cell lesion of fibrogenic origin with the possibility of multicentric synchronous recurrent aggressive fibromatosis."
"A gene expression signature indicative of activated wound responses is common to more than 90% of non-neoplastic tissues adjacent to breast cancer, but these tissues also exhibit substantial heterogeneity. We hypothesized that gene expression subtypes of breast cancer microenvironment can be defined and that these microenvironment subtypes have clinical relevance. METHODS: Gene expression was evaluated in 72 patient-derived breast tissue samples adjacent to invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ. Unsupervised clustering identified two distinct gene expression subgroups that differed in expression of genes involved in activation of fibrosis, cellular movement, cell adhesion and cell-cell contact. We evaluated the prognostic relevance of extratumoral subtype (comparing the Active group, defined by high expression of fibrosis and cellular movement genes, to the Inactive group, defined by high expression of claudins and other cellular adhesion and cell-cell contact genes) using clinical data. To establish the biological characteristics of these subtypes, gene expression profiles were compared against published and novel tumor and tumor stroma-derived signatures (Twist-related protein 1 (TWIST1) overexpression, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta)-induced fibroblast activation, breast fibrosis, claudin-low tumor subtype and estrogen response). Histological and immunohistochemical analyses of tissues representing each microenvironment subtype were performed to evaluate protein expression and compositional differences between microenvironment subtypes. RESULTS: Extratumoral Active versus Inactive subtypes were not significantly associated with overall survival among all patients (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.4, 95% CI 0.6 to 2.8, P = 0.337), but there was a strong association with overall survival among estrogen receptor (ER) positive patients (HR = 2.5, 95% CI 0.9 to 6.7, P = 0.062) and hormone-treated patients (HR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 7.0, P = 0.045). The Active subtype of breast microenvironment is correlated with TWIST-overexpression signatures and shares features of claudin-low breast cancers. The Active subtype was also associated with expression of TGF-beta induced fibroblast activation signatures, but there was no significant association between Active/Inactive microenvironment and desmoid type fibrosis or estrogen response gene expression signatures. Consistent with the RNA expression profiles, Active cancer-adjacent tissues exhibited higher density of TWIST nuclear staining, predominantly in epithelium, and no evidence of increased fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: These results document the presence of two distinct subtypes of microenvironment, with Active versus Inactive cancer-adjacent extratumoral microenvironment influencing the aggressiveness and outcome of ER-positive human breast cancers."

"Desmoid tumors (DTs), the commonest extra-intestinal manifestation of familial adenomatosis polyposis (FAP), are monoclonal neoplasms demonstrating fibroblastic - myofibroblastic differentiation; they are locally invasive without metastatic capacity. FAP-associated DT natural history knowledge is limited; we examined patient and tumor characteristics for a FAP-DT cohort and evaluated anti-DT therapy molecular target expression levels (immunohistochemical analyses, FAP-DT tissue microarray; TMA). Forty-four patients were classified as intra-abdominal (IA; n=26), abdominal wall (AW)/extra-abdominal (EA; n=12) or concomitant IA/AW (n=6) based on DT primary diagnosis location. Positive family histories were found in 62% of FAP versus 10% of DT patients. Surgery was the mainstay therapy for AW/EW patients, whereas IA DTs received surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, tamoxifen, NSAIDs, and/or imatinib. Eight of 20 completely resected DTs in the IA and AW/EA groups recurred; 12 of 38 patients in these groups (33%) developed secondary lesions elsewhere. Two intestinal mesenteric DT patients died of disease, three from other cancers, 27 are alive with disease and 12 are alive without disease. All evaluable FAP-DT exhibited nuclear beta-catenin, 65% were positive for cyclin D1, and 66% expressed nuclear p53. No ERalpha expression was observed, but ERbeta was expressed in 72%. COX2 was expressed in all evaluable FAP-DTs. KIT was rarely found in DTs but both PDGFRs and their ligands were expressed. Comparing biomarker expression (IA vs. EA DTs), only nuclear ER-ss staining was significantly higher in EA lesions (p=0.0070); no other markers were site informative. Enhanced knowledge of FAP-DT molecular underpinnings will facilitate development of novel therapeutic strategies."

"Desmoplastic fibroblastoma (DF) is a benign fibroblastic/myofibroblastic tumor. Cytogenetic analyses have revealed consistent rearrangement of chromosome band 11q12, strongly suggesting that this region harbors a gene of pathogenetic importance. To identify the target gene of the 11q12 rearrangements, we analyzed six cases diagnosed as DF using chromosome banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), single-nucleotide polymorphism array and gene expression approaches. Different structural rearrangements involving 11q12 were found in five of the six cases. Metaphase FISH analyses in two of them mapped the 11q12 breakpoints to an ~20-kb region, harboring FOSL1. Global gene expression profiling followed by quantitative real-time PCR showed that FOSL1 was expressed at higher levels in DF with 11q12 rearrangements than in desmoid-type fibromatoses. Furthermore, FOSL1 was not upregulated in the single case of DF that did not show cytogenetic involvement of 11q12; instead this tumor was found to display a hemizygous loss on 5q, including the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) locus, raising the possibility that it actually was a misdiagnosed Gardner fibroma. 5'RACE-PCR in two 11q12-positive DF did not identify any fusion transcripts. Thus, in agreement with the finding at chromosome banding analysis that varying translocation partners are involved in the 11q12 rearrangement, the molecular data suggest that the functional outcome of the 11q12 rearrangements is deregulated expression of FOSL1."
"Mesenteric fibromatosis is a benign fibrous tumor, characterized by proliferations of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, locally aggressive but non-metastasizing. It can occur rarely in association with familial adenomatous polyposis or sporadically (related with previous trauma, abdominal surgery or prolonged estrogens intake). Small bowel mesentery is the most common site of origin of mesenteric fibromatosis. The authors report a case of a 47-years-old male with a large mass involving the mesentery of the first jejunal loops. The patient was symptomatic for nausea and referred an increasing abdominal circumference; a CT scan showed a huge mass (34 x 29 x 15 cm) very close to the superior mesenteric vessel roots. The surgical treatment consisted in the en bloc removal of the mass weighting 13 kg."
"The morphologic changes seen in desmoid-type fibromatosis after radiotherapy have not been well studied, and the degree of cytologic atypia, cellularity, mitotic activity, and lesional necrosis found in desmoid-type fibromatosis treated with ionizing radiation has not been thoroughly assessed. Therefore, we evaluated a series of primary and locally recurrent desmoid-type fibromatoses resected at variable intervals after radiation therapy (XRT) and compared their histopathologic and immunophenotypic features with paired pathologic specimens that were obtained before radiotherapy. The morphologic characteristics of desmoid-type fibromatoses resected before and after radiotherapy were not significantly different in 7 of the 8 cases studied. One case resected 191 months after XRT showed morphologic evidence of fibrosarcomatous transformation, with zonal necrosis, hypercellularity, severe nuclear atypia, and increased mitotic activity. No significant differences in the immunophenotype of desmoid-type fibromatosis were observed after XRT. In rare cases of recurrent desmoid-type fibromatosis, the differential diagnosis may include radiation-induced fibrosarcoma. Our data suggest that histomorphologic alterations attributable to the effects of ionizing radiation in desmoid-type fibromatosis are minimal. Therefore, the presence of cytologic features of malignancy in this setting warrants careful examination and consideration of the rare occurrence of postradiation sarcoma. Lesser degrees of nuclear atypia seen in isolation do not necessarily indicate a poor prognosis in irradiated desmoid-type fibromatosis."
Desmoplastic fibroma (DF) is a benign but locally aggressive tumor usually recognized as an intraosseous counterpart of soft tissue fibromatosis in both gnathic and extra-gnathic sites. The most common site is mandible followed by pelvis and long bones. Maxilla has been reported to be involved very rarely. Desmoplastic fibroma is recently being considered to be one of the oral manifestations of tuberous sclerosis rather than a coincidental finding. We report an unusual case of a girl with a previous diagnosis of tuberosclerosis who presented at 8 years with an oral lesion diagnosed as desmoplastic fibroma.
"We report the case of a 22-year-old patient who presented to the emergency department with epigastric pain and vomiting. Haematological studies showed a rapid decrease in haemoglobin levels from 13.6 g/dl to 4.9 g/dl. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed the presence of fluid around the spleen and the patient was immediately referred for surgery. An intra-abdominal desmoid tumour presenting as a hemorrhagic shock has not previously been described. Given the relatively benign course of the disease and the young age at presentation, this clinical entity should not be overlooked as it has the potential to invade vessels and therefore be fatal."
"Prophylactic surgery is still considered the standard treatment for patients with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP). Laparoscopic (Lap) surgery has been introduced as an alternative approach. The aim was to evaluate the feasibility and short- to long-term outcomes after prophylactic FAP surgery in adolescent. PROCEDURES: A retrospective review of a database of adolescent patients with FAP identified through the Hereditary Colorectal Tumor Registry in a single Institution between 2005 and 2011. Patients underwent Lap total colectomy (TC) with ileo-rectal anastomosis (IRA) or proctocolectomy (PC) with ileal-pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA). The main outcomes were: Hospital stay, postoperative complications, desmoid tumor rates, tumor recurrence, long-term complications. RESULTS: Sixteen consecutive patients with median age 16 (range 13-19) and median BMI 22 (17-29) underwent surgery. [correction made here after initial online publication]. Of them 14 patients had LAP TC with IRA and 2 had PC with IPAA. Operative time (median, range) was TC/IRA 270 (210-330) minutes; PC/IPAA 370 (360-380) minutes. Length of extraction site was cm (median, range) 6(5-8). Lymph Node harvest (median, range) 81 (32-139). Postoperative stay days (median, range) were 6 (4-24). Five patients (31.2%) showed dysplasia on the pathological report and 3 of them showed severe dysplasia. Median follow-up time (FU) was 39 months, range (10-82). The anastomotic leak rate for 30 days was 2 (12.5%). Pouch failure was 0. Post-surgical desmoid tumors rate was 1 (6.2%) and there was no tumor recurrence. Anastomotic stricture, SBO and mortality were zero. CONCLUSIONS: Lap approach is feasible and shows acceptable postoperative outcomes. Lap surgery can be an appealing alternative for prophylactic surgery in adolescent FAP patients. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2012; 59: 1223-1228. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
"We report a rare case of mediastinal desmoid tumor in a 17-year-old man. The patient was a 17-year old man who had underwent surgery for mediastinal tumor at our hospital 2 years before. The tumor was diagnosed as a solitary fibrous tumor of the mediastinum. After 2 years, chest computed tomography(CT) and magnetic resonance imaging( MRI) showed a mass at the previously resected site. Surgery was performed again under the diagnosis of recurrent tumor. The tumor densely adhered to the superior vena cava, right innominate vein, pericardium, and the right lung. The tumor was completely resected with the aid of the partial extracorporeal circulation. Finally, both previously resected tumor and the recurrent tumor were diagnosed pathologically as desmoid tumors."
"T41A (64%), S45F (29%), and S45P (7%). Germline APC mutations were present in 7 (16%) desmoid patients. Eight (18%) patients had desmoids that were wild type for CTNNB1 and had no known clinical signs or family history suspicious for FAP at the time of testing or with extended follow up (n = 6). Beta-catenin nuclear labeling was observed in 38 of 41 (92%) tested cases, 34 (89%) of which showed mutations in either CTNNB1 (n = 29) or APC (n = 5). Nuclear localization of beta-catenin was seen in the majority of pediatric desmoids and was most often associated with somatic mutations in CTNNB1. However, a significant proportion of pediatric patients harbored germline mutations in APC. Given the implications, genetic counseling is recommended for children diagnosed with desmoid tumors lacking CTNNB1 mutations because this population is enriched for FAP patients."
"Primary intra-thoracic desmoids are exceedingly rare borderline tumors, with 34 reported cases in the English-language literature. The characteristic localized infiltrative growth and the high rate of recurrence can result in life-threatening conditions. Radical surgical resection is considered to be the primary treatment. Achieving negative surgical margins is a challenge. Cases with positive surgical margins are associated with a high rate of local recurrence; therefore, other multimodal approaches play a large role in their therapy. CASE REPORTS: The authors reviewed the relevant literature and presented examples of long-term follow-up of 3 intra-thoracic desmoid tumour patients, multidisciplinarily treated between 2000 and 2008. All reports of intra-thoracic desmoid tumors that the authors could find on PubMed or in the reference sections of these PubMed located articles were included using the search terms: intra-thoracic, desmoid, aggressive fibromatoses. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the rarity of the disease and the heterogeneity of the cases, it is difficult to assess the importance of the information for everyday clinical practice. It does however provide a useful guide for reference."
"Desmoid fibromatosis, although histologically benign, infiltrates local structures. The involvement of neural structures can lead to difficult neuropathic pain and the escalating use of analgesics. We report a patient with desmoid fibromatosis of the chest wall causing brachial plexus infiltration. As the tumor was locally invasive and unresectable, he was treated with radiation therapy and oral tamoxifen. On follow-up, there was significant pain relief, sustained reduction in the tumor size, and reduced analgesic requirement. Antineoplastic treatments like local radiation therapy and targeted systemic therapy with hormones or other agents can be considered in the management of selected unresectable desmoid fibromatosis to improve symptom control and reduce polypharmacy."
"Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors are one of the leading causes of death in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Their behavior is unpredictable and their biology is poorly understood, accounting for the lack of a standardized medical and surgical approach. The aim of this study was to evaluate the mortality rate of patients with intra-abdominal desmoid tumors and to identify prognostic factors for the evolution of the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 154 patients with intra-abdominal desmoid tumors were included in the study. Each tumor was staged and each patient was categorized according to the stage of their most advanced tumor. Mortality was analyzed and the univariate risk factors associated with survival were included in a multivariable Cox regression model. A scoring system was derived from the multivariate analysis to refine outcomes within stages. RESULTS: Five-year survival of patients with stage I, II, III, and IV intra-abdominal desmoid tumor were 95%, 100%, 89%, and 76% respectively (P < 0.001). Severe pain/narcotic dependency, tumor size larger than 10 cm, and need for total parenteral nutrition were shown to further define survival within stages. Five-year survival rate of stage IV patient with all of the above-mentioned risk factors was only 53%. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed the validity of the staging system to predict mortality in patients with intra-abdominal desmoid tumors and identified additional risk factors able to better define the risk of death within each stage. Risk stratification is crucial in directing patients with advanced disease and poor prognosis to the most appropriate medical and surgical options."
"Retroperitoneal desmoid tumours are uncommon tumours usually occurring in young females in their reproductive age group and commonly have a benign course but sometimes they can become malignant. These tumours belong to family of myofibroblastic fibromatosis. These tumours are composed of fibroblastic cells with bands of collagen and ill defined cytoplasm and rarely show mitosis. Recurrence is common especially after incomplete excision. Retroperitoneal desmoid is an uncommon tumour among desmoid group which led to an obstructed labour. Here a 28-year-old female diagnosed to have a pelvic desmoid, was missed during the antenatal check-up, presented as an obstructed labour which necessitated a caesarean section. The patient underwent a definitive surgery three months later for excision of tumour. The tumour was excised through a combined abdominal and gluteal incision. Histopathological report revealed an aggressive fibromatosis (retroperitoneal desmoid)."
"A 58-year-old female who presented with a lower gastrointestinal bleed was referred for an (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/CT after a colonoscopy revealed a submucosal mass in the ascending colon. The PET/CT confirmed the presence of an FDG-avid mass in the ascending colon with no other FDG-avid abnormalities. Dual time-point imaging was performed and showed a significant increase in FDG uptake in the mass, which raised strong suspicion of a colon malignancy. Although an initial biopsy of the mass did not show evidence of neoplasia, a decision was made to proceed with a right hemicolectomy based on high clinical and imaging suspicion of malignancy. Histological evaluation of the hemicolectomy revealed a benign colon desmoid tumour."
"Proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) has been developed and refined since its introduction in the late 1970s. Nonetheless, it is a procedure associated with significant morbidity. The aim of this review was to provide a structured approach to the challenges that surgeons and physicians encounter in the management of intraoperative, postoperative and reoperative problems associated with ileoanal pouches. METHODS: The review was based on relevant studies identified from an electronic search of MEDLINE, Embase and PubMed databases from 1975 to April 2011. There were no language or publication year restrictions. Original references in published articles were reviewed. RESULTS: Although the majority of patients experience long-term success with an ileoanal pouch, significant morbidity surrounds IPAA. Surgical intervention is often critical to achieve optimal control of the situation. CONCLUSION: A structured management plan will minimize the adverse consequences of the problems associated with pouches."
"Primary chest wall sarcomas are rare mesenchymal tumors and their mainstay of therapy is wide surgical resection. We report our single-institution, multidisciplinary experience with full-thickness resection for primary chest wall sarcomas. METHODS: A retrospective review of our prospectively maintained databases revealed that 51 patients were referred for primary chest wall sarcomas from 1990 to 2009. RESULTS: All patients required resections that included rib and/or sternum. Twenty-nine patients (57%) had extended resections beyond the chest wall. Forty-two patients (82%) required prosthetic reconstruction and 17 patients (33%) had muscle flap coverage. Overall, 51% (26/51) of patients received neoadjuvant therapy. Seventy-three percent (11/15) of high-grade soft tissue sarcomas, 77% (10/13) of high-risk bony sarcomas, and 67% (4/6) of desmoid tumors were treated with induction therapy. Negative margins were obtained in 46 patients (90%). There were no perioperative mortalities. Eight patients (16%) experienced complications. Local recurrence and metastasis was detected in 14 and 23%. Five-year overall and disease-free survivals were 66% and 47%, respectively. Favorable prognostic variables for survival included age </=50 years, tumor volume </=200 cm, desmoid tumor, bony tumor, chondrosarcoma, and low-grade soft tissue sarcoma. CONCLUSIONS: We report our multidisciplinary experience with primary chest wall sarcomas that included induction therapy in the majority of high-risk soft tissue and bony sarcomas and desmoid tumors. Despite aggressive preoperative treatments, acceptable surgical results with low morbidity and mortality can be achieved. Neoadjuvant systemic therapy may reduce local and distant recurrence and improve overall survival."
"Desmoid tumours are rare mesenchymal tumours with unpredictable progression and high recurrence risk. They can occur sporadically or in association with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), which is caused by germline APC mutations. The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway has a central role in the pathogenesis of desmoid tumours. These tumours can occur due to either a somatic CTNNB1 or APC mutation but can also be the first manifestation of FAP. Because germline APC analysis is not routinely performed in children with desmoid tumours, the diagnosis FAP may escape detection. The aim of this study is to form guidelines for the identification of possible APC germline mutation carriers among children with desmoid tumours, based on CTNNB1 mutation analysis and immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) for beta-catenin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed IHC of beta-catenin and mutation analysis of CTNNB1 and APC in 18 paediatric desmoid tumours, diagnosed between 1990 and 2009 in the Erasmus MC, Rotterdam. RESULTS: In 11 tumours, IHC showed an abnormal nuclear beta-catenin accumulation. In this group a CTNNB1 mutation was detected in seven tumours. In two tumours with an abnormal nuclear beta-catenin accumulation and no CTNNB1 mutation, an APC mutation was identified, which appeared to be a germline mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant staining of beta-catenin in paediatric desmoids helps to identify children at risk for FAP. We recommend to screen paediatric desmoid tumours for nuclear localisation of beta-catenin and consequently for CTNNB1 mutations. For patients with nuclear beta-catenin expression and no CTNNB1 mutations, APC mutation analysis should be offered after genetic counselling."

"Soft-tissue sarcomas are a group of malignant tumours whose clinical management is complicated by morphological heterogeneity, inadequate molecular markers and limited therapeutic options. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have been shown to play important roles in cancer, both as therapeutic targets and as prognostic biomarkers. An initial screen of gene expression data for 48 RTKs in 148 sarcomas showed that ROR2 was expressed in a subset of leiomyosarcoma (LMS), gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) and desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF). This was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on 573 tissue samples from 59 sarcoma tumour types. Here we provide evidence that ROR2 expression plays a role in the invasive abilities of LMS and GIST cells in vitro. We also show that knockdown of ROR2 significantly reduces tumour mass in vivo using a xenotransplantation model of LMS. Lastly, we show that ROR2 expression, as measured by IHC, predicts poor clinical outcome in patients with LMS and GIST, although it was not independent of other clinico-pathological features in a multivariate analysis, and that ROR2 expression is maintained between primary tumours and their metastases. Together, these results show that ROR2 is a useful prognostic indicator in the clinical management of these soft-tissue sarcomas and may represent a novel therapeutic target."
"Metastatic propensity of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is heterogeneous and may be determined by gene expression patterns that do not correlate well with morphology. The authors have reported gene expression patterns that distinguish 2 broad classes of clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC-gene set), and other patterns that can distinguish heterogeneity of serous ovarian carcinoma (OVCA-gene set) and aggressive fibromatosis (AF-gene set); however, clinical follow-up data were not available for these samples. METHODS: In the current study, gene expression patterns in 73 samples of high-grade STS were examined using spotted cDNA microarray slides that contained approximately 16,000 unique UniGene clusters. Approximately 50% of the genes present in the ccRCC-, OVCA-, and AF-gene sets were also represented in the data from this chip set, and these were combined to form a composite gene set of 278 probes. RESULTS: Hierarchical clustering using this composite gene set suggested the existence of subsets of the STS samples. Analysis revealed differences in the time to development of metastatic disease between the clusters defined by the first branch point of the clustering dendrogram (P = .005), and also among the 4 different clusters defined by the second branch points (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: This approach suggests the existence of >2 subsets of high-grade pleomorphic STS, each with distinct clinical behavior. A composite gene set such as that described here may be useful to stratify STS in clinical trials, and may be of practical utility in patient management."
"Desmoid tumour is a common extraintestinal manifestation of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) who have undergone prophylactic colectomy. We aimed to determine whether MRI provides equivalent or better assessment of desmoid tumours than CT, the current first-line investigation. METHODS: Following ethics approval and informed consent, FAP patients with known desmoid tumour underwent contrast-enhanced 64-slice multidetector CT (MDCT) and 1.5 T MRI (incorporating T(1) weighted, T(2) weighted, short tau inversion-recovery and T(1) weighted with contrast, axial, sagittal and coronal sequences). The number, site, size, local extent, tumour signal intensity and desmoid-to-aorta enhancement ratio were analysed. RESULTS: MRI identified 23 desmoid tumours in 9 patients: 9 intra-abdominal desmoid (IAD) tumours, 10 abdominal wall desmoid (AWD) tumours and 4 extra-abdominal desmoid (EAD) tumours. CT identified only 21 desmoids; 1 EAD and 1 AWD were not identified. The two modalities were equivalent in terms of defining local extent of desmoid. Five IAD tumours involved the bowel, six caused ureteric compression and none compromised the proximal superior mesenteric artery. There was no difference in median desmoid size: 56.7 cm(2) (range 2-215 cm(2)) on MDCT and 56.3 cm(2) (3-215 cm(2)) on MRI (p=0.985). The mean MRI enhancement ratio, at 1.12 (standard deviation 0.43), was greater than the CT enhancement ratio, which was 0.48 (0.16) (p<0.0001). High signal intensity on T(2) MRI was associated with increased MRI enhancement ratio (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: MRI is at least equivalent (and may be superior) to MDCT for the detection of desmoid tumours in FAP. Coupled with the advantage of avoiding radiation, it should be considered as the primary imaging modality for young FAP patients."
"Deep fibromatoses, or desmoid tumors, arise from connective tissue. Imaging can frequently suggest the diagnosis of these aggressive, benign neoplasms. Cross-sectional imaging commonly demonstrates an enhancing solid mass that resembles scar tissue, typically without osseous involvement. We report a case of an extra-abdominal desmoid tumor involving the teres minor muscle in a symptomatic 42-year-old woman with unusual features of medullary involvement and negative nuclear beta-catenin staining."
"We report a case of granular-cell tumor (GCT) arising in the subcutaneous tissue of the abdominal wall and describe its radiologic and histologic characteristics. The differential diagnosis of a mass in this site may include multiple benign and malignant stromal lesions. In this case, the presentation, location, and radiological features suggested a desmoid tumor (aggressive fibromatosis). Treatment of the mass involved surgical excision with negative margins, and histological analysis confirmed the presence of a benign GCT. We report a case of this rare, benign tumor to allow the radiologist and pathologist to consider this disease in the differential diagnosis when presented with similar cases."
"Desmoid-type (aggressive) fibromatosis (desmoid tumor) is a soft tissue neoplasm that can occur in both children and adults. Although it is formally classified as an intermediate-grade neoplasm because of its propensity for locally invasive growth, it can lead to severe and life-threatening problems. Because metastases do not arise from desmoid tumor, therapeutic interventions have historically focused on surgery or radiation to achieve local tumor control. These approaches may be ineffective or impractical for some children. In those cases, systemic therapy with cytotoxic or noncytotoxic therapy has been used. Because of the relative rarity of this neoplasm in children, knowledge on the use of chemotherapy is based largely on anecdotal reports or retrospective series. Limited conclusions can be drawn, though, from these types of reports. In the last 10 years, two prospective phase II clinical trials of chemotherapy for children with desmoid tumor have been conducted in cooperative clinical trials centered in North America. We review the results of those clinical trials and suggest future directions for systematically approaching this disease to better define the role of chemotherapy for children with desmoid tumor."
"Desmoid tumors are benign soft tissue tumors associated with locally aggressive growth and high rates of morbidity, but they do not metastasize via lymphatic or hematogenous routes. While most of the data on desmoid tumors originates in the adult literature, many of the findings have been applied to the management of pediatric patients. This article discusses the epidemiology, etiology, clinical presentation, pathology, and treatment of this rare tumor in the pediatric population and includes a literature review of the most recent large series of pediatric patients with desmoid tumors."
"A total of 110 patients with malignant (n=54, 49,1%), intermediate (n=24, 21.8%) or benign (n=31, 28.2%) soft tissue tumors were included in the study aimed to determine the soft tissue tumor elastographic picture and the overall role of elastographic visualization in soft-tissue tumor diagnostics. All the patients underwent grey-scale real-time elastography, colored Doppler mapping, energy Doppler mapping and ultrasonic elastography. The ultrasonic elastography included the quality assay of tissue color mapping and tissue stiffness index assay. All the tests were performed with Hitachi HI Vision 900 US scanner with 5-13 MHz US-sensors. In soft tissue tumors the elastography had 97% sensitivity equal to grey-scale US-scan sensitivity. Based on the results of the study, the elastography doesn't lead to any benefits as a stand-alone diagnostic technique. In most cases it doesn't lend any additional value compared to grey-scale US-scan. The only exceptions are the low-grade lyposarcomas, diffuse lypomas and fibrolypomas and desmoids. Nevertheless, elastography is still a useful method in surgical treatment planning as it allows to pinpoint the exact amount of involved tissues more effective than grey-scale US-scan techniques."
"Topoisomerase 2 alpha (TOP2A), HER-2/neu, and survivin are genes that lie on chromosome 17 and correlate with the prognosis and prediction of target-driven therapy against tumors. In a previous study, we showed that TOP2A transcripts levels were significantly higher in soft tissue sarcomas (STS) than in benign tumors and desmoid-type fibromatoses (FM). Because these genes have been insufficiently examined in STS, we aimed to identify alterations in TOP2A and HER-2 expression by fluorescent in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, as well as that of survivin, and correlate them with clinicopathologic findings to assess their prognostic value. METHODS: Eighteen FM and 244 STS were included. Fluorescent in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were performed on a tissue microarray. RESULTS: TOP2A and survivin were more highly expressed in sarcomas than in FM. TOP2A was an independent predictor of an unfavorable prognosis; it was combined with formerly established prognostic factors (primarily histologic grade and tumor size at diagnosis) to create a prognostic index that evaluated overall survival. Gene amplification/polysomy (13%) did not correlate with protein overexpression. Survivin and HER-2 expression were not associated with patient outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings might become valuable in the management of patients with STS and possibly in the prospective evaluation of responses to new target-driven therapies."
"A 15-year-old male patient with palpable abdominal tumor presented to our hospital. CT scan revealed a giant tumor, 15 cm in diameter, with infiltration to the pancreas body. In addition, the tumor invaded to the greater curvature of the stomach and the transverse colon. We performed distal gastrectomy, distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy and transverse colectomy. The final diagnosis of histopathology was desmoid tumor. The tumor recurred locally 9 months after the surgery. Recurrent legion was unresectable because of the invasion to the orifice of SMV and weekly combination chemotherapy of VLB and MTX was started. Although a partial response was achieved for a local recurrent legion after 20 courses, CT scan showed other new recurrent multiple lesions in the abdominal cavity. Due to the severe abdominal discomfort and intestinal obstruction, a reduction surgery was performed 5 times in total. Endocrine therapy and administration of NSAID were not effective. Tumor progression was uncontrollable, and the patient died 5 years and 8 months after the initial surgery."
Desmoid tumors are rare forms of low grade malignancies. They are characterized by a strong potential of local invasion. Although they are considered histologically benign they behave aggressive locally. They typically occur in the abdominal wall or within the abdomen. Mediastinal localisation is very rare. The only curative treatment is wide surgical excision but the surgery is difficult and the risk of local recurrence is high.
Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) of psoas muscle origin is extremely rare and little is known about its radiological features. We here present such a case in a 24-year-old man with psoas AF and ilium bone involvement. The authors stress the contibutive diagnostic role of MRI.
"Mesenteric Panniculitis (MP), representing the very large major subgroup where inflammation and fat necrosis predominate and Retractile Mesenteritis (RM), much rarely found, where fibrosis and retraction predominate. In histo-pathological terms the preferred terminology is sclerosing mesenteritis. We hereby extensively illustrate the characteristic MDCT findings of MP through pictures selected among a collection of cases constituted over a 5-year period. All patients were scanned with 64-row MDCT equipment. We also review the literature and discuss the differential diagnosis. The radiological diagnosis of MP was based on classical CT signs described in the literature and comprising: the presence of a well-defined ""mass effect"" on neighbouring structures (sign 1) constituted by mesenteric fat tissue of inhomogeneous higher attenuation than adjacent retroperitoneal or mesocolonic fat (sign 2) and containing small soft tissue nodes (sign 3). It may typically be surrounded by a hypoattenuated fatty ""halo sign"" (sign 4) and an hyperattenuating pseudocapsule may also surround the all entity (sign 5). The last two signs are considered inconstant but very specific. The absence of histological verification constitutes the weakness of our study. The differential diagnosis of MP is extensive and includes all disorders that can affect the mesentery. The most common ones are lymphoma, well-differentiated liposarcoma, peritoneal carcinomatosis, carcinoid tumor, retroperitoneal fibrosis, lipoma, mesenteric desmoid tumor, mesenteric inflammatory pseudotumor, mesenteric fibromatosis and mesenteric edema. PET/CT is proved useful to correctly exclude mesenteric tumoral involvement in patients presenting with typical MR The course of MP is favorable in most cases and progression of MP to retractile mesenteritis not only appears very being rare but finally remains doubtful."
"Desmoid fibromatosis (also known as infantile or aggressive fibromatosis) is a rare soft tissue tumour that is occasionally seen in children. Although histologically benign, its growth pattern is highly aggressive often showing invasion of surrounding musculature and bone. Frequently found in cosmetically sensitive areas, complete excision can present a challenging problem. However, incomplete surgical excision is associated with high recurrence rates and although the disease responds to chemo and radiotherapy, both carry significant risks in young children. The management of four paediatric desmoid fibromatoses occurring in the midface is discussed. The recent and pertinent literature is comprehensively reviewed and an algorithm for the management of paediatric desmoid fibromatoses is proposed."
"To determine whether proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) can help differentiate between benign and malignant soft tissue lesions, and to assess if there is a correlation between 1H-MRS data and the mitotic index. METHODS: MR measurements were performed in 43 patients with soft tissue tumours >15 mm in diameter. Six cases were excluded for technical failure. Examinations were performed at 1.5 T using a single-voxel point resolved spectroscopy sequence (PRESS) with TR/TE = 2000/150 ms. The volume of interest was positioned within the lesion avoiding inclusion of necrotic regions. In all patients, a histological diagnosis was obtained and the corresponding mitotic index was also computed. 1H-MRS results and histopathological findings were compared using the chi-squared test and correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Choline was detected in 18/19 patients with malignant tumours and in 3/18 patients with benign lesions. The three benign lesions included one desmoid tumour, one ossificans myositis and one eccrine spiradenoma. Choline was not detected in 15 patients with benign lesions or in one patient with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Resulting 1H-MRS sensitivity and specificity were 95% and 83% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Absence of choline peak is highly predictive of benign tumours suggesting that 1H-MRS can help to differentiate malignant from benign tumours. KEY POINTS: * 1H-MRS may allow differentiation between benign and malignant soft tissue lesions * Absence of choline peak is highly predictive of benign soft tissue lesions * Malignant tumours with a mitotic index >2/10 HPF had a positive choline peak * A choline peak may still be identified in some benign tumours."
"Benign and malignant pleural processes display a large and overlapping spectrum of morphological appearances, and can be difficult to distinguish, histologically, from each other. beta-catenin, a participant in the wingless-type (Wnt) transduction pathway, is involved in the pathogenesis of malignant mesothelioma and has received limited evaluation for its ability to serve as a diagnostic aid for distinguishing between individual pleural disorders. We performed immunohistochemistry for beta-catenin on 10 pleural malignant mesotheliomas, 10 examples of mesothelial hyperplasia and 18 cases of organizing pleuritis. Although differences were noted in staining intensity between the mesothelioma and mesothelial hyperplasia groups, extensiveness and cellular location were similar. Staining intensity (mean +/- s.d.) in mesotheliomas (2.00 +/- 0.67) was significantly less intense than in mesothelial hyperplasia cases (3.00 +/- 0.00) (p=0.0005). Stromal cell staining was cytoplasmic in all cases, and endothelial cell staining was membranous, submembranous and cytoplasmic. Nuclear expression of beta-catenin was not observed in any of the cases studied. This lack of nuclear staining in the stromal cells of organizing pleuritis differs markedly from the previously reported high frequencies of nuclear beta-catenin expression in other pleural spindle cell proliferations (desmoid tumors and solitary fibrous tumors). In summary, the current study adds to previous work indicating a role for beta-catenin in the genesis of pleural conditions including organizing pleuritis, mesothelial hyperplasia and malignant mesothelioma. Although IHC for beta-catenin does not appear to be conclusive for separating benign from malignant mesothelial proliferations, it may be valuable for assisting in the differential diagnosis of mesothelial and spindle cell proliferations in the pleura."
"Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a severely disabling heritable disorder of connective tissue characterized by congenital malformations of the great toes and progressive heterotopic ossification that forms qualitatively normal bone in characteristic extraskeletal sites. The worldwide prevalence is approximately 1/2,000,000. There is no ethnic, racial, gender, or geographic predilection to FOP. Children who have FOP appear normal at birth except for congenital malformations of the great toes. During the first decade of life, sporadic episodes of painful soft tissue swellings (flare-ups) occur which are often precipitated by soft tissue injury, intramuscular injections, viral infection, muscular stretching, falls or fatigue. These flare-ups transform skeletal muscles, tendons, ligaments, fascia, and aponeuroses into heterotopic bone, rendering movement impossible. Patients with atypical forms of FOP have been described. They either present with the classic features of FOP plus one or more atypical features [FOP plus], or present with major variations in one or both of the two classic defining features of FOP [FOP variants]. Classic FOP is caused by a recurrent activating mutation (617G>A; R206H) in the gene ACVR1/ALK2 encoding Activin A receptor type I/Activin-like kinase 2, a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptor. Atypical FOP patients also have heterozygous ACVR1 missense mutations in conserved amino acids. The diagnosis of FOP is made by clinical evaluation. Confirmatory genetic testing is available. Differential diagnosis includes progressive osseous heteroplasia, osteosarcoma, lymphedema, soft tissue sarcoma, desmoid tumors, aggressive juvenile fibromatosis, and non-hereditary (acquired) heterotopic ossification. Although most cases of FOP are sporadic (noninherited mutations), a small number of inherited FOP cases show germline transmission in an autosomal dominant pattern. At present, there is no definitive treatment, but a brief 4-day course of high-dose corticosteroids, started within the first 24 hours of a flare-up, may help reduce the intense inflammation and tissue edema seen in the early stages of the disease. Preventative management is based on prophylactic measures against falls, respiratory decline, and viral infections. The median lifespan is approximately 40 years of age. Most patients are wheelchair-bound by the end of the second decade of life and commonly die of complications of thoracic insufficiency syndrome."

"The purpose of this article is to illustrate the common locations of desmoid tumors (deep fibromatosis), complications of intra- and extraabdominal desmoids, and treatment-related changes in their imaging appearance. CONCLUSION: Desmoids are locally aggressive fibrous tumors with a tendency to recur. Desmoids can be intraabdominal, in the abdominal wall, or extraabdominal. Complications, such as compression or invasion of adjacent structures, and abscess formation can occur. Treatment options include observation, local treatment (surgery, radiotherapy), or systemic therapy (conventional chemotherapy, molecular targeted agents)."
"Desmoid tumors are nonmalignant neoplasms of mesenchymal origin that mainly contain fibroblast lineage cells. These tumors often occur in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) coli who have germ line mutations in the APC gene. Given emerging data that has implicated multipotent mesencyhmal stromal cells (MSC) in the origin of mesenchymal tumors, we hypothesized that desmoid tumors may arise in patients with FAP after MSCs acquire somatic mutations during the proliferative phase of wound healing. To test this idea, we examined 16 desmoid tumors from FAP-associated and sporadic cases, finding that all 16 of 16 tumors expressed stem cell markers, whereas matching normal stromal tissues were uniformly negative. Desmoid tumors also contained a subclass of fibrocytes linked to wound healing, angiogenesis, and fibrosis. Using an MSC cell line derived from an FAP-associated desmoid tumor, we confirmed an expected loss in the expression of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and the transcriptional repressor BMI-1 while documenting the coexpression of markers for chondrocytes, adipocytes, and osteocytes. Together, our findings argue that desmoid tumors result from the growth of MSCs in a wound healing setting that is associated with deregulated Wnt signaling due to APC loss. The differentiation potential of these MSCs combined with expression of BMI-1, a transcriptional repressor downstream of Hedgehog and Notch signaling, suggests that desmoid tumors may respond to therapies targeting these pathways."
"Desmoid tumors are rare clinical entities that cause significant morbidity based on their locally aggressive nature. Complete resection with wide margins is the standard of care; however, when arising in the neck, resection is limited due to proximity of the lesion to critical structures. CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a complete resection of a desmoid tumor requiring extensive resection of cervical extensor musculature. We were able to achieve a total resection of a cervical desmoid tumor with no evidence of recurrence at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Complete resection of desmoid tumors is the standard of care. In this case, we felt that complete resection would lead to iatrogenic instability; therefore, an occiput to thoracic fusion was performed at the time of the resection."
"Leiomyomas of the deep soft tissue in the extremities of children are very rare. These benign soft tissue tumors occur more frequently in adults between the fourth and sixth decades of age. Women are more commonly affected than men, with the uterus the most common location. We present a rare case of deep soft tissue leiomyoma in the foot of a 5-year-old male. The tumor was misdiagnosed as a desmoid-type fibromatosis from the findings of both magnetic resonance imaging and needle biopsy. The unusual age of presentation, atypical location, and failure of magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound-guided needle biopsy in diagnosing the lesion make the case interesting. The case also highlights the importance of treating such patients at specialist tertiary centers with a multidisciplinary setting."
"Fibrous hamartoma (FH) of infancy is a distinctive fibrous growth that most frequently occurs at birth and during the postnatal period. It is important for clinicians and pathologists to recognize this entity to avoid an aggressive approach. METHODS: We herein describe the clinicopathologic features of 9 FHs diagnosed at a single institution between 1997 and 2010. RESULTS: There were 7 boys and 2 girls, and the mean age of presentation was 14.7 months. The common locations were the lower back and gluteal region (n = 3) and scrotum (n = 2). They were solitary lesions, and measured 1.0 to 7.0 cm in maximum diameter (mean, 4.9 cm). The excised masses tended to be poorly circumscribed, and consisted of an intimate mixture of firm, gray-white tissue with fat. Histologically, these lesions were composed of 3 components forming a vague, irregular, organoid pattern: well-defined intersecting trabeculae of fibrocollagenous tissue; loosely textured areas of small, rounded, primitive mesenchymal cells; and mature fat. Over a median follow-up of 72 months, no patient showed recurrence. CONCLUSION: FH should be distinguished from other forms of fibromatosis and malignant tumors because it is benign and usually cured by local excision."
"To analyse the correlation between beta-catenin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in sporadic desmoid tumours. METHODS AND RESULTS: The correlation between beta-catenin aberrant expression and VEGF overexpression was examined and microvessel density (MVD) assessed by immunohistochemical expression of CD31 in 74 samples (63 primary and 11 recurrent samples, 63 patients) of sporadic desmoid tumours without familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). beta-catenin gene mutation and mRNA expression of VEGF was then examined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). There was a statistically significant correlation between widespread nuclear expression of beta-catenin and overexpression of VEGF in all desmoid tumours (P = 0.04, Fisher's exact test). MVD in recurrent tumours was significantly higher than that in primary tumours. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities of beta-catenin and VEGF overexpression play an important role in the neoplastic progression of sporadic desmoid tumours."

"wide surgical excision and immediate plastic reconstruction with ePTFE mesh after intraoperative confirmation by frozen section of disease-free margins >1 cm. No immediate postoperative complications were recorded, and no patients developed recurrence after a median follow-up period of 60 months. The long-term mean of global health status recorded was 100%. Radical resection aided by intraoperative margin evaluation by frozen sections, followed by immediate mesh reconstruction, is a safe procedure and can provide a definitive cure without functional limitations for patients with desmoid tumors of the anterior abdominal wall."
"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and desmoid tumors (DTs) are two rare mesenchymal tumor. Anecdotal reports of individuals with both diseases led us to make the hypothesis that the association is a nonrandom event as the probability would be extremely low to observe such cases if they were independent events. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the existence of patients with GIST and DT in a large multicenter cohort at 10 institutions in the United States, Australia and Europe. Data on gender, age at diagnosis, KIT, PDGFRA, CTNNB1 mutation status and follow-up time after diagnosis were collected. RESULTS: We identified 28 patients diagnosed with both tumors. DT was diagnosed after GIST in 75% of patients and concomitantly in 21%. In only one case (4%), GIST was diagnosed after DT. KIT or PDGFRA mutations were detected in 12 of 14 GIST, 9 in KIT exon 11, 2 in KIT exon 9 and 1 in PDGFRA. CONCLUSION: A statistical analysis of these 28 cases suggests a nonrandom association between GIST and DT. Further studies may be able to elucidate the underlying biology responsible for this association."
"Nobody has analyzed the sequelae of desmoids according to the type of surgery that precipitated them. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine whether the clinical effects of abdominal desmoids would be worse in patients with restorative proctocolectomy than in patients with ileorectal anastomosis. DESIGN: This is a retrospective, database study. PATIENTS: Included were patients with familial adenomatous polyposis who had undergone proctocolectomy with IPAA or colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis, and subsequently developed an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measures were the clinical course of the desmoids; morbidity, and the requirement for stoma. RESULTS: There were 86 patients: 49 had restorative proctocolectomy and 37 had ileorectal anastomosis. Patient demographics were similar. Average follow-up was 9.8 years (range, 2.7-23.8) and 16.3 years (range, 2.3 - 42.9). Treatment of the desmoids included surgery (64.4% vs 65.6%), medical therapy (69.4% vs 59.5%), chemotherapy (36.2% vs 30.0%), and radiotherapy (4.5% vs 10.0%), and was the same for each group. The overall complication rate of desmoids was similar, approaching 70%. The risk of individual complications was also similar (bleeding (2.0% vs 0.0%), fistula (10.2% vs 13.5%), bowel obstruction (32.7% vs 48.6%), pain (34.7% vs 21.6%), and death related to desmoid tumors (2.0% vs 10.8%)); 38.8% of the restorative proctocolectomy group and 51.4% the ileorectal group had surgery for desmoid tumor complications (P = .21), and 22.4% and 22.2% of patients ultimately had permanent stomas. LIMITATIONS: This study was limited by the relatively small numbers of patients. CONCLUSION: The morbidity associated with desmoid tumors has not been shown to differ, whether they arise after restorative proctocolectomy or ileorectal anastomosis."
"Central odontogenic fibroma is a rare odontogenic neoplasm that originates from odontogenic ectomesenchyme. Here, a case of central odontogenic fibroma in a 17-year-old male is reported. Since the present case showed a multilocular radiolucency with partially ill-defined border between the right mandibular condyle and the distal root of the right mandibular third molar, differential diagnosis involved a wide range of pathosis from benign lesions like ameoloblastic fibroma and odontogenic myxoma to more aggressive lesions such as desmoplastic fibroma, juvenile aggressive fibromatosis, or fibrosarcoma."
"Endometriosis is a common gynaecological condition that usually presents as an abdominal lump. It can be a diagnostic dilemma and should be considered as a differential diagnosis for lumps in the abdomen in females. We discuss a case of abdominal wall endometriosis following caesarean section, which was misdiagnosed as a desmoid tumour."
"Extraabdominal desmoid tumor is a locally aggressive tumor despite being histologically benign. To avoid local recurrence, it is important to preoperatively detect the exact localization and extension of the infiltrating or disseminating lesion in this tumor. We report a case of recurrent extraabdominal desmoid tumor, which arose in the posterior thigh region. A 68 yrs old male presented with thigh swelling since past 22 years over posterior aspect of thigh increasing in size over the past 2years. The swelling was extending over the medial and anterior aspect of thigh. On investigation he was found to be case of desmoid tumor of thigh."

"Desmoid tumours (also called deep or aggressive fibromatoses) are potentially life-threatening fibromatous lesions. Hereditary desmoid tumours arise in individuals affected by either familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or hereditary desmoid disease (HDD) carrying germline mutations in APC. Most sporadic desmoids carry somatic mutations in CTNNB1. Previous studies identified losses on 5q and 6q, and gains on 8q and 20q as recurrent genetic changes in desmoids. However, virtually all genetic changes were derived from sporadic tumours. To investigate the somatic alterations in FAP-associated desmoids and to compare them with changes occurring in sporadic tumours, we analysed 17 FAP-associated and 38 sporadic desmoids by array comparative genomic hybridisation and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification. Overall, the desmoids displayed only a limited number of genetic changes, occurring in 44% of cases. Recurrent gains at 8q (7%) and 20q (5%) were almost exclusively found in sporadic tumours. Recurrent losses were observed for a 700 kb region at 5q22.2, comprising the APC gene (11%), a 2 Mb region at 6p21.2-p21.1 (15%), and a relatively large region at 6q15-q23.3 (20%). The FAP-associated desmoids displayed a significantly higher frequency of copy number abnormalities (59%) than the sporadic tumours (37%). As predicted by the APC germline mutations among these patients, a high percentage (29%) of FAP-associated desmoids showed loss of the APC region at 5q22.2, which was infrequently (3%) seen among sporadic tumours. Our data suggest that loss of region 6q15-q16.2 is an important event in FAP-associated as well as sporadic desmoids, most likely of relevance for desmoid tumour progression."
"Primary chest wall tumors consist of 5% of all thoracic tumors and 0.04% of all primary tumors. Almost half of primary chest wall tumors are benign. Over half are metastases from distant malignancies or direct invasions from adjacent malignancies such as breast cancer, lung cancer, mesothelioma and mediastinal tumor. Chest wall mass can form from trauma and infection. So it is important to take a medical history including past trauma and infection. Past history of cancer and radiation is also important. While diagnostic imaging such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is valuable in determining boundary of tumor and detecting invasion to the nerves and vessels, biopsy should be performed to confirm diagnosis. Then the strategy for each patient with chest wall tumor should be planed according to the results of preoperative examinations. For high grade malignancy, such as osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma, multidisciplinary treatment including chemotherapy should be considered. For an unresectable case or patient with inadequate margin at previous chest wall resection, radiation should be considered. Radio-sensitive neoplasm such as desmoid tumor responds well to radiation. Wide resection of malignant chest wall tumor is the treatment of choice. Although a 2-cm surgical margin may be adequate for chest wall metastasis, benign chest wall tumor and chondrosarcoma, malignant chest wall tumor undergo wide resection to include a 4-cm margin. Selection of chest wall reconstruction for each patient is also important to prevent postoperative complication."
"A case report and a discussion of recently published data. OBJECTIVE: To highlight the occurrence of postoperative fibromatosis arising in the cervical spine. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Fibromatosis is a benign, locally invasive fibroblastic proliferation that can cause compressive effects on adjacent structures. Although the precise etiology of fibromatosis remains unclear, numerous studies have investigated the role of pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells in beta-catenin-regulated tumorigenesis. At present, aggressive fibromatosis is managed with wide local excision. Postoperative radiation therapy is indicated for incomplete excision. METHODS: A 48-year-old woman presented with a 2-year history of enlarging paracervical fibromatosis after undergoing extensive cervicothoracic instrumentation for excision of an extradural schwannoma. The patient underwent wide local excision of the neck mass, with right trapezius myocutaneous flap reconstruction of the subsequent defect. RESULTS: Histologically, the lesion was shown to be fibromatosis. Six months postoperatively, the patient was doing well with no recurrence. CONCLUSION: Fibromatosis is an important diagnosis to consider when evaluating locally aggressive spinal lesions at sites of prior operative repair. Molecular and genetic studies pertaining to the role of mesenchymal stem cells and beta-catenin in the pathogenesis of aggressive fibromatosis tumors could lead to possible worthwhile treatment strategies in the future."
"young age, large size, presentation as recurrence, girdles or intra-abdominal location, involved surgical margins, and beta-catenin-activating mutations. Recently collected data prompted the suggestion that these tumors warrant a wait-and-see strategy (clinical-radiological observation, without any treatment), since their natural history is often characterized by lengthy periods of stability or even regression, considering to treat only patients with progressing or symptomatic disease."
"To assess the feasibility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of desmoid tumours in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following ethical approval and informed consent, FAP patients with desmoids underwent DTI. Fractional anisotropy (FA), relative anisotropy (RA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were compared to control muscle using Mann-Whitney test; and to tumour site and signal intensity using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Imaging was repeated after 1 year. RESULTS: 15 desmoids (6 intra-abdominal; 6 abdominal wall, 3 extra-abdominal; size range: 1.6-22.9 cm) were evaluated in 9 patients. DTI was successful in 12/15 desmoid tumours. Median (range) of RA, FA and ADC were 0.23x10(-3) mm2/s (0.17-0.26); 0.27x10(-3) mm2/s (0.21-0.31); and 1.65x10(-3) mm2/s (1.39-1.91) for desmoids, significantly different from muscle: 0.27x10(-3) mm2/s (0.23-0.40), 0.32x10(-3) mm2/s (0.28-0.46), and 1.45x10(-3) mm2/s (0.92-1.63) (p=0.0001, p=0.0001, p=0.0016, respectively). There was no difference in RA, FA or ADC between tumour sites, or signal intensity (p>0.05). One year later, 2 patients had died. Tumour increased in size in 1 patient (+61%). DTI quantification was possible in only 8/13 tumours. FA, RA and ADC were not significantly different from baseline (p=0.77, 0.71 and 0.34, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of water diffusion has the potential to provide insight into tumour microstructure and is feasible in desmoids. Desmoid tumours demonstrate anisotropy but diffusion is less restricted and less directional than in muscle."
"Ability to identify patients with familial adenomatous polyposis who have a high risk of developing desmoid tumors may affect decisions in clinical practice. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to assess several risk factors for desmoid tumor development in an international cohort of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and to evaluate the clinical relevance of risk factors. DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND PATIENTS: Polyposis registries in The Netherlands, France, Denmark, Finland, and Italy provided information on familial adenomatous polyposis patients with desmoid tumors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We used univariate and multivariable analyses of data from registries in The Netherlands, France, Denmark, and Finland to test whether gender, APC mutation site, previous colorectal surgery, colorectal cancer, and family history for desmoid tumors contribute to risk of developing desmoid tumors at any location, or specifically at an intra-abdominal location. The effect of family history was tested with a generalized linear mixed model. RESULTS: : Of 2260 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis from 912 families in The Netherlands, France, Denmark, and Finland, 220 patients (10%) had desmoid tumors (101 men). In 387 patients with desmoid tumors (including 167 patients from the Italian registry), the median age at diagnosis of the first desmoid tumor was 31 years (range, 4 months-74 years). Desmoid locations were intra-abdominal (53%), abdominal wall (24%), extremities (9%), and unknown sites or combinations of sites (14%). Multivariable analysis of risk factors for desmoids at any location showed surgery (OR, 2.58; P = .0004), an APC mutation 3' of codon 1444 (OR, 3.0; P < .0001), and a positive family history (P < .0001) to be independently associated with desmoid development. When only intra-abdominal location was analyzed, APC mutation site was not associated with desmoid development. LIMITATIONS: Selection bias may have occurred. CONCLUSIONS: A positive family history for desmoid tumors, abdominal surgery, and APC mutation site are significant risk factors for development of desmoid tumors. The results may have implications for determining the optimal management of FAP patients and guide future studies."

"The utility of CTNNB1 (encoding beta-catenin) genotyping for diagnosing sporadic desmoid tumours (DT) when traditional clinicopathological parameters were inconclusive was evaluated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cases included were: (i) new primary lesions where initial DT diagnosis was inconclusive; and (ii) possible recurrent DT versus scar. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues were obtained via needle biopsy or a surgical excision (57 specimens) as part of initial assessment. DNA extraction, CTNNB1 exon 3 amplification and sequencing were conducted in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA)-approved molecular diagnostics laboratory. For patients with no previous DT history (n = 47) sequencing identified mutations in 30 (64%), substantiating DT diagnosis. In biopsies with non-mutated (NM) CTNNB1 (n = 17) the test was inconclusive; in seven of these, a diagnosis of DT was strongly favoured in the subsequent surgical resection specimen. Ten patients with previously resected DT were evaluated; mutation was identified in six cases (60%), indicating DT over scar. In two (20%) with primary tumours harbouring CTNNB1 mutation no mutation was found, favouring scar over DT; the other two NM-CTNNB1 cases (20%) were inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: CTNNB1 genotyping can be very useful in 'difficult to diagnose' lesions when the differential diagnosis includes DT. Recognizing inherent test limitations, the presence of CTNNB1 mutation can inform the therapeutic approach."

"Desmoid tumors (DTs) are histologically benign proliferations of stromal cells but may grow locally aggressive. Overall, DTs are rare (0.03% of all neoplasms). A minority of DTs is associated with Gardner syndrome and mutations of the familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) gene. Most spontaneous DTs are associated with mutations of the beta-catenin gene. This mutation results in the activation of Wnt/catenin signaling. Due to their variable clinical presentation and behavior, no standard approach for DTs can be recommended. In most cases of DTs of the extremities surgical extirpation is indicated, whereas in many other cases, a multimodal and multidisciplinary concept should be followed. In this review article, we discuss the diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment options for DTs, including targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors."
"Desmoid tumors are mesenchymal fibroblastic/myofibroblastic proliferations with locoregional aggressiveness and high ability to recur after initial treatment. We present the results of the largest series of sporadic desmoid tumors ever published to determine the prognostic factors of these rare tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred twenty-six patients with a desmoid tumor at diagnosis were included, and the following parameters were studied: age, sex, delay between first symptoms and diagnosis, tumor size, tumor site, previous history of surgery or trauma in the area of the primary tumor, surgical margins, and context of abdominal wall desmoids in women of child-bearing age during or shortly after pregnancy. We performed univariate and multivariate analysis for progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: In univariate analysis, age, tumor size, tumor site, and surgical margins (R2 v R0/R1) had a significant impact on PFS. PFS curves were not significantly different for microscopic assessment of surgical resection quality (R0 v R1). In multivariate analysis, age, tumor size, and tumor site had independent values. Three prognostic groups for PFS were defined on the basis of the number of independent unfavorable prognostic factors (0 or 1, 2, and 3). CONCLUSION: This study clearly demonstrates that there are different prognostic subgroups of desmoid tumors that could benefit from different therapeutic strategies, including a wait-and-see policy."
"The treatment of desmoid tumours (DTs) is controversial. Anti-oestrogen therapy has frequently been used, but clear information of its efficacy is lacking. In this systematic review we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis to assess the effectiveness of anti-oestrogen therapy in terms of ability to induce partial or complete regression of DTs. METHOD: A systematic review of articles published in English between January 1983 and December 2009 was carried out according to the RECIST criteria. A literature search was performed on electronic databases including: United States National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE-PubMed), Excerpta Medica (EMBASE), Cochrane Library and Google search engine. Two-hundred articles dealing with DTs were identified but only fourty-one were were selected as appropriate for the study. The chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Data on 168 DTs treated with anti-oestrogen agents, alone or in combination with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, were identified with an overall response rate of 51%. There was no difference in response according to the type of DTs or between different anti-oestrogen therapies. Combination with anti-inflammatory drugs did not improve the outcome. Toremifene was sometimes effective in cases resistant to tamoxifen. Response did not seem to be related to oestrogen receptor status. CONCLUSIONS: Despite potential inaccuracies in the methodology, the results of the review indicate that anti-oestrogen therapy produces some effect in about one half of patients with DTs. Its indication compared with other treatments is discussed."
"ADAM12, MMP2 and midkine, were found to be commonly expressed in a large cohort of human DT samples assembled on a tissue microarray. Interestingly, enhanced midkine expression significantly correlated with a higher propensity and decreased time for primary DT recurrence (log-rank p = 0.0025). Finally, midkine was found to enhance the migration and invasion of primary DT cell cultures. Taken together, these studies provide insights into potential DT molecular aberrations and novel beta-catenin transcriptional targets. Further studies to confirm the utility of midkine as a clinical DT molecular prognosticator and a potential therapeutic target are therefore warranted.

"Neuromuscular choristoma (NMC) is a rare peripheral nerve lesion in which mature skeletal muscle fibers lie within the nerve and its fascicles. Given limited follow-up, its natural history is poorly understood. The occurrence of aggressive fibromatosis in one of the authors' patients and its occurrence in reported cases suggests an etiological relationship between the 2 lesions. This study attempts to explain the association and its frequency. METHODS: All cases of NMCs seen in consultation or treated at the Mayo Clinic were identified. Demographic and clinical data were reviewed in cases with coexistent aggressive fibromatosis. Pathology and neuroimaging studies were reexamined. In addition, an extensive literature review was performed to explore the association of NMC with aggressive fibromatosis, with special attention given to pathological and imaging characteristics and the development of aggressive fibromatosis. RESULTS: The authors identified 10 patients with a diagnosis of NMC who were treated at the Mayo Clinic between 1992 and 2010. Four of 5 with adequate follow-up had developed a definite or suspected aggressive fibromatosis. A review of the initial pathological specimens in these cases revealed no evidence of fibromatosis, but all of the lesions exhibited accompanying hypocellular collagenous tissue. On MR images, all cases showed areas of low signal intensity, which significantly differed from muscle, nerve, and NMC components. On available serial MR imaging studies, aggressive fibromatosis seemed to originate in such lower-intensity regions. In the 18 previously reported cases of NMC, 5 patients developed recurrent masses diagnosed as either definite (2 cases) or possible (3 cases) fibromatosis. Review of the published imaging studies in these cases suggests the presence of lower intensity areas similar to those observed in the 10 patients treated at the Mayo Clinic. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that the development of aggressive fibromatosis in patients with NMC has been underreported. A direct relationship between the NMC and the development of aggressive fibromatosis is suggested by pathological and neuroimaging evidence."
"The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety and therapeutic effects of ultrasound (US)-guided high intensity focused US (HIFU) ablation in the treatment of extra-abdominal desmoid tumours. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From May 2006 to May 2010, ten consecutive patients with pathologically proven extra-abdominal desmoid tumours were treated by US-guided HIFU ablation. Eight patients with multiple recurrent tumours were treated with a palliative aim, two patients with new solitary tumours were treated with a curative aim. The mean size of the largest tumour was 9.2 cm (range 5.9-12.8 cm). An acoustic power of 300-500 W was used according to the echogenic changes after energy exposure, intermittent HIFU exposure of 2-3 s was applied until the planned target area became hyperechoic on US. Outcome of HIFU ablation was observed by serial contrast-enhanced imaging examinations during follow up. RESULTS: HIFU ablation was successfully performed without major complications. Large volume coagulation necrosis was obtained in all patients. During a mean follow up of 30 months (range 8-55 months), the treated tumours (n = 25) shrank significantly (>50% in volume). Complete tumour necrosis was observed in the two patients with solitary new tumours. Two patients received repeat HIFU ablation for enlarged residual tumours. No tumour spread along the treated area was observed in any patient. CONCLUSION: US-guided HIFU ablation could be used as an effective minimally invasive therapy for local control of extra-abdominal desmoid tumours."
"Desmoid tumors are rare lesions without any metastatic potential but a strong tendency to invade locally and to recur. These tumors are associated with women of fertile age, especially during and after pregnancy. CASE PRESENTATION: The case of a desmoid tumor of the anterior abdominal wall in a 40-year-old Caucasian man with no relevant family history is presented, describing its appearance on computed tomography and ultrasonography. The patient, who presented with a painless mass in the left anterolateral abdomen, had a history of previous urgent abdominal surgery after a shotgun injury two years earlier. Radical resection of the affected abdominal wall musculature was performed, and the defect was reconstructed with polypropylene mesh. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of desmoid tumor should be strongly considered even in male patients with an abdominal mass and a history of previous abdominal surgery. The goal of its treatment is complete tumor excision and avoidance of the development of complications such as hernia."
"The desmoid tumor is a rare tumor with an incidence of 2-4 cases per million people each year, and represents 0.03% of all cancers. The tumor is composed of fibrous tissue that produces masses of well-differentiated hard elastic consistency. According to their site of onset, the desmoid tumors are classified in abdominal, intra-abdominal, and extra-abdominal. The abdominal cases develop inside the abdominal muscles of the abdominal wall upright, especially in women in their 2nd - 4th decade of life, particularly in those who have been pregnant. METHODS: A 66-year-old patient underwent nephrectomy in 2006 for the detection of a massive tumor in the right kidney (EI: pT1bNx). The patient came to our observation for the radiological tracking (CT) of a solid lesion of 4 cm below the right arch, 2 years after surgery. For this reason it was decided to refer the patient to a series of percutaneous biopsies. The report describes a histologic lesion of fibromatosis. After one year a new CT exam showed a significant increase of the size of the lesion, with a diameter of 11.6 x 7.9 cm, and abdominal involvement to ascending colon. Given the discrepancy between the CT data and the histological report, it was decided to refer the patient to a lombotomic exploration and the subsequent removal of the lesion, which appeared of hard, elastic consistency and well capsulated. The final histology test confirmed the fibromatosis lesion. CONCLUSIONS: The desmoid tumor is a rare tumor characterized by the proliferation of fibrotic tissue. The tumor is composed of well-differentiated fibrous tissue and has a hard-elastic consistency. Regarding the development of dermoid tumors, several risk factors were identified, including extra-abdominal fibromatosis, genetic factors, endocrine factors. Other causes may arise from trauma or abdominal injury in surgical outcomes of appendectomy, laparotomy and other surgical scars (scar fibromatosis) or genetic predisposing factors. The surgical resection of dermoid tumors should be the therapy of choice, complete and radical, to cover the possible excision of a wide margin of surrounding structures concerned, and those arrangements should ensure a low rate of relapse. However, in cases of inoperable cancer due to extension, anti-estrogen therapy may have an important therapeutic and well-tolerated effect, besides being relatively non-toxic, even at high doses. A close follow-up is indicated, however, and warmly recommended."
"Patients developing short bowel syndrome (SBS) are at risk for hepatobiliary complications. Radiation enteritis and radiation-induced liver disease are potential complications of radiation therapy (XRT). The authors hypothesized that SBS patients with a history of abdominal XRT would be at increased risk for hepatobiliary complications. METHODS: The authors reviewed 92 adult patients developing SBS as a complication of operation for malignancy (n = 37) and/or XRT (n = 55). Hepatobiliary disease was evaluated by liver function tests, radiologic imaging, endoscopy, and histologic studies. RESULTS: Rectal cancer was the most frequent tumor in both groups (36% vs 35%). There were significantly more ovarian cancers (18% vs 3%, P < .05) in the radiation group and fewer desmoid tumors (0% vs 24%, P < .05). Intestinal remnant length was similar, but radiation patients more frequently had colon present (87% vs 62%, P < .05) and were less likely to have type I anatomy (33% vs 65%, P < .05). Radiation patients were less likely to be weaned off parenteral nutrition (PN; 16% vs 41%, P < .05). Cirrhosis/portal hypertension was more frequent in the radiation group (35% vs 11%, P < .05). Radiographic evidence of fatty liver, end-stage liver disease and the risk of cholelithiasis post-SBS were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: SBS patients with a history of XRT were more likely to develop cirrhosis and portal hypertension than SBS patients with malignancy alone. Radiation SBS patients were less likely to wean from PN despite more favorable intestinal anatomy."
"The frequency of the c-kit exon 10 variant, M541L, (c.1621 A>C) in aggressive fibromatosis (AF) was recently determined to be 2.5-fold higher than in healthy controls. It was thus hypothesised that M541L could be associated with the development of AF. METHODS: 42 cases of sporadic AF were investigated for c-kit exon 10 alterations, by traditional sequencing. Subsequently, the AF cases and 126 healthy volunteers were screened for the M541L by pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Genotype frequency of M541L in AF was 16.7% (allele frequencies: A, 0.92 and C, 0.08), which did not differ from the control group. Moreover the M541L variant was found to be not tumour specific. CONCLUSIONS: The result classifies the M541L variant of c-kit exon 10 as a single nucleotide polymorphism. Because its prevalence does not differ between the AF and general populations, an association with AF tumourigenesis is unlikely."
"To report long-term outcomes following radiotherapy for desmoid tumors in children and young adults and identify variables impacting local-regional control and treatment complications. PROCEDURE: From 1978 to 2008, 30 patients <30 years old were treated with radiotherapy for a pathologically confirmed desmoid tumor. The median age at radiotherapy was 23.7 years old (range, 10.3-29.9). Fifteen patients underwent definitive radiotherapy, 14 received radiotherapy after gross total resection, and 1 received preoperative radiotherapy. Sixteen patients received 1.8 Gy once daily and 14 received 1.2 Gy twice daily. Variables analyzed for prognostic value included gender, age at diagnosis, primary or recurrent presentation, age at radiotherapy, tumor site, tumor size, extent of resection, fractionation schedule, and radiotherapy dose. RESULTS: The actuarial 15-year overall survival and local-regional control rates were 96% and 55%, respectively. Local-regional control in patients <18 years old at the time of radiotherapy was 20% versus 63% in those 18-30 years old (P = 0.08). Local-regional control rates for tumors receiving >/= 55 Gy and < 55 Gy were 79% and 30%, respectively (P = 0.02). No other factors had a statistically significant association with local-regional control by univariate analysis. Twelve of 30 patients experienced grade 3-4 complications, including pathologic fractures, impaired range of motion, pain, and in-field skin cancers. CONCLUSIONS: The role of radiotherapy in managing young patients with desmoid tumors remains unclear. Younger patient age is associated with inferior local-regional control following RT. In children and young adults, doses >/=55 Gy were associated with improved tumor control, but also lead to increased risk of complications."
"Surgical resection has had control rates of 53% to 77% in the treatment of extra-abdominal desmoid tumors. Surgical excision combined with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) has had local control rates of up to 83% in some series. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of resection combined with radiotherapy (brachytherapy, EBRT, or both) in the treatment of extra-abdominal desmoid tumors. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 24 consecutive patients (27 histologically confirmed extra-abdominal desmoid tumors). Patients were included in the study if they had a lesion that was potentially resectable with a wide margin, allowing for limb salvage, and if they did not have a contraindication to radiotherapy. Limb functioning was assessed with the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) scoring system. Seventeen patients (7 men, 10 women) with 19 tumors met the inclusion criteria. Mean age at diagnosis was 23.4 years. Follow-up (mean, 4.28 years) involved serial clinical examinations and magnetic resonance imaging of tumor sites. After surgery, the tumors were treated with brachytherapy (n = 6), EBRT (n = 10), or both (n = 3). Two of the 17 tumors in patients with negative margins of resection recurred locally (local control rate, 88.2%). Mean MSTS score was 29/30 (96.7%). The role of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and other treatments for extra-abdominal desmoid tumors is not well defined. When wide-margin resection and radiotherapy can be performed with limb preservation surgery, local control and complication rates compare favorably with those of other reported methods of treatment. Given the results and limitations of our study, we cannot make a definitive recommendation as to which modality--brachytherapy or EBRT--should be used in the treatment of extra-abdominal desmoid tumors."
"Desmoid tumors are cytologically bland fibrous neoplasms originating from musculoaponeurotic structures throughout the body. The cause of desmoid tumors is uncertain, but may be related to trauma or hormonal factors, or may have a genetic association. These tumors can be found in some young women during pregnancy or just after giving birth. We report herein a case of desmoid tumor on the inner aspect of the abdominal wall that mimicked a large subserosal uterine leiomyoma. Initial clinical examination of the patient suggested a large abdominal wall tumor, while the imaging techniques including transabdominal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging suggested a large subserosal uterine leiomyoma as the initial diagnosis. This case emphasizes the importance of clinical examination during the diagnostic process."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a comparitively rare tumor with unpredictable growth and varying local recurrence rates. It does not develop distant metastases but locally it shows an aggressive and infiltrative behavior. Clinically, aggressive fibromatosis manifests as a painless, firm, often rapidly enlarging mass, fixed to underlying bone or soft tissue. It is never encapsulated. Histologically, it is rich in collagen and fibroblastic cells that are devoid of hyperchromatic or atypical nuclei, but with more variable cellularity in different tumor sections."
"The BCL-6 proto-oncogene encodes a transcriptional repressor protein. Among normal tissues, BCL-6 expression is confined to germinal center B-cells and a subpopulation of T-helper cells. Little is known about BCL-6 expression in mesenchymal tissues. We examined a series of solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) and other mesenchymal tumors for BCL-6 expression. Immunohistochemistry for BCL-6 was performed on 64 mesenchymal tumors [26 SFT (19 benign/uncertain, 7 malignant), 6 synovial sarcomas (SS), 5 gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), 5 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), 5 leiomyosarcomas (LMS), 9 leiomyomas (LM) 4 desmoid tumors (DT), 4 perineuriomas (PN)]. Nuclear immunoreactivity was considered positive. Six BCL-6 positive SFT were also tested for BCL-6 gene rearrangement/amplification by FISH. Nuclear expression of BCL-6 was seen in 13/26 SFT, 5/5 LMS, 1/9 LM, 5/6 SS, 1/5 GIST, 1/5 MPNST, 1/4 PN, and 0/5 DT. BCL-6 expression was significantly more frequent in malignant (6/7) as compared with benign/uncertain SFT (6/19) (p=0.02) and in LMS (5/5) as compared with LM (1/9) (p=0.003). FISH for BCL-6 rearrangement/amplification was negative in all tested cases. We have observed BCL-6 expression in 50% or more of SFT, SS, and LMS, and in a lesser percentage of LM, GIST, MPNST and PN. Significantly more frequent expression of BCL-6 in malignant compared with benign/uncertain SFT and in LMS compared with LM suggests abnormalities in the BCL-6 signaling pathway may contribute to malignant transformation in at least some mesenchymal tumors. It is unlikely that BCL-6 expression in mesenchymal tumors is due to BCL-6 gene amplification or rearrangement."
"Fibromatosis or desmoid tumor is a benign, slow-growing fibroblastic neoplasm originating from musculoaponeurotic stromal elements. These tumors are characterized by an infiltrative and locally aggressive growth pattern, frequent recurrences, but no metastatic potential. The etiology is unknown, but these tumors have been associated with trauma and genetic disorders. Breast fibromatosis is exceedingly rare and often misdiagnosed, comprising only 0.2% of breast tumors. Clinically, it might mimic other breast lesions, such as carcinoma. Only approximately 6 case series and 100 case reports of this disorder affecting the breast are documented, and only 5 cases of bilateral breast fibromatosis have been reported. We describe the case of a 20-year-old woman who presented to our institution with firm, nontender masses palpable in both breasts. Prior ultrasound was suspicious for carcinoma, and breast core biopsies were suggestive of phyllodes tumor. An excisional biopsy was necessary to establish the diagnosis of breast fibromatosis for both masses. A review of articles published on desmoid tumors and breast fibromatosis was performed with emphasis on articles published in the last 10 years. Fibromatosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with hard breast lumps suspicious of other diseases."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a benign tumor, thought to arise from deep musculoaponeurotic structures, rarely found in the head or neck. However, when it does occur in the head and neck region, it tends to be more aggressive and associated with significant morbidity, which may be attributed to the vital vascular, neurological or anatomical structures in close proximity. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 39-year-old Pakistani man who presented with a two-month history of a lump on the right side of his neck. The mass was excised and histopathological analysis revealed a case of aggressive fibromatosis. CONCLUSION: Due to the rarity of the condition no guidelines are available on the indications and extent of each modality. Due to its aggressive behavior and tendency to invade local structures and recur, a multi-modality management strategy is usually employed. On the basis of this case, we suggest that aggressive surgery is a viable management option and may be successfully used as a single modality treatment."
"Reactive lesions of bone and soft tissue can appear alarming on histologic examination because they are often cellular and have atypical (activated) cytologic features, such as distinct nucleoli and mild hyperchromasia, and mitotic activity. Reactive lesions of bone and periosteum also produce bone and cartilage matrix, resulting in confusion with osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma. Careful attention to key cytomorphological features such as the pattern of bone formation, uniform appearance of cells, and absence of atypical mitoses should help identify the reactive nature of a lesion. Correlation with clinical and radiological findings is also imperative to avoid misclassification of the tumor because reactive lesions often arise at sites where osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma are rare (e.g., the hand) and lack aggressive radiological features. In this review we discuss reactive lesions of bone that are commonly confused with malignant neoplasms and that the practicing pathologist is likely to encounter at some point. Several of these lesions have had characteristic chromosomal translocations documented in recent years, but continue to be included as reactive lesions based on their overall clinicopathological features."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumor) of the neck is rare. When feasible, surgery is the best treatment option. However, complete excision with negative margins is not possible in most cases because of the involvement of vascular and nervous structures. Also, surgery results in poor functional and aesthetic outcomes. Sometimes debulking surgery with positive margins is performed, but the anatomy of the neck is a challenge for oncologic surgeons, and recurrences are not uncommon. Radiotherapy is seldom employed for the same reasons. On the other hand, systemic treatment with chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and noncytotoxic agents such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been used with good results. We report a case of inoperable aggressive fibromatosis of the neck that was successfully treated for about 21 months with a combination of chemotherapy and the NSAID indomethacin. As far as we know, this is the first reported use of a combination of chemotherapy and an anti-inflammatory drug in the treatment of aggressive fibromatosis of the neck. We also review the literature on cases of aggressive fibromatosis of the neck that have been reported over the past 12 years."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a rare, benign, fibroblastic neoplasm, characterized by local invasion and a relatively high rate of recurrence. Here a case of laryngeal aggressive fibromatosis in a 47-year old man is reported. The patient presented with worsening dyspnoea and hoarseness and was hospitalized for treatment with partial laryngectomy. Final pathological evaluation of the tumour confirmed a diagnosis of aggressive fibromatosis. The patient has remained disease-free without further treatment for 5 years. This study demonstrated that aggressive fibromatosis may occur around the larynx and can be managed by partial laryngectomy alone. It is, therefore, important to include this rare disease entity in the routine differential diagnosis of laryngeal masses."

"Abdominal wall reconstruction continues to evolve with improvement in technique and technology. This study reviews our experience with challenging full thickness (skin, muscle, and fascia) defects following tumor resections often in high-risk patients. METHODS: All patients who underwent abdominal wall reconstruction following full thickness tumor resection were included in the series. Data queried included patient demographics, indications, tumor defect, risk factors, type of repair, complications, and recurrence of the hernia. RESULTS: A total of 30 patients underwent reconstruction after full thickness resection of abdominal wall tumors or tumors of intra-abdominal organs involving abdominal wall. The indications included desmoid tumors (n=6); abdominal wall sarcoma (n=7); colon cancer invading abdominal wall (n=10); pancreatic, ovarian, and retroperitoneal sarcoma with abdominal wall invasion (n=3); and other (n=4). In all, 17 patients underwent simultaneous resection of one or more intra-abdominal organs. The type of repair included primary closure (+/-components separation), or mesh-assisted closure (+/-primary fascial closure). Acellular dermal matrix was used more commonly in the patients with tumors of gastrointestinal origin. The average follow-up period was 23 months. Postoperative complications developed in 6 patients (20.6%). Incidence of postoperative complications was higher in patients with colon cancer invading the abdominal wall or those with bowel anastomosis or radiation therapy. An abdominal bulge or hernia developed in 4 patients (13.7%); it was higher in patients who did not have mesh reconstruction. CONCLUSION: Abdominal wall reconstruction after full thickness tumor resection is challenging. It can be performed safely and effectively with attention to surgical technique, patients' risk of infection, and type of mesh. Acellular dermal matrix graft has been a useful addition to minimize morbidity and recurrence in these high-risk patients."
"Desmoid tumors constitute 0.02% to 0.03% of all tumors. Consequently, few case reports exist for breast desmoids, even fewer identifying bilateral disease. We present a case report of a patient with bilateral breast desmoids and shoulder desmoid without evidence of FAP or Gardner syndrome. This case report explores the clinical, radiographic, pathologic, and treatment elements for desmoid tumors as well as a review of the literature."
"We have previously reported the use of the vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rib (VEPTR) for treatment of thoracic dystrophy. This report describes our experience with this device and other novel titanium constructs for chest wall reconstruction. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of all children and adolescents undergoing chest wall reconstruction with titanium constructs between December 2005 and May 2010. RESULTS: Six patients have undergone chest wall reconstruction with VEPTR or other titanium constructs. Four had chest wall resection for primary malignancy, 1 had metastatic chest wall tumor resection, and 1 had congenital chest wall deformity. There were no immediate complications, and all patients have exhibited excellent respiratory function with no scoliosis. CONCLUSIONS: Chest wall reconstruction after tumor resection or for primary chest wall deformities can be effectively accomplished with VEPTR and other customized titanium constructs. Goals should be durable protection of intrathoracic organs and preservation of thoracic volume and function throughout growth. Careful preoperative evaluation and patient-specific planning are important aspects of successful reconstruction."
"Desmoid tumor, also known as aggressive or deep fibromatosis or musculoaponeurotic fibromatosis, is a rare tumor. Desmoids are characterized by their ability to locally infiltrate; while frequently locally recurrent, they lack metastatic potential. Desmoids typically arise within the abdomen or abdominal wall, but can be extra-abdominal, most commonly in the proximal extremities. The infiltrative and recurrent nature of desmoid tumors can render surgical resection challenging if acceptable function and cosmesis is to be maintained. Consequently, desmoid management frequently involves a multidisciplinary approach that combines the expertise of several surgical specialists, for example, surgical oncologists and plastic surgeons, and also medical and radiation oncologists. As will be reviewed in this article, working together before undertaking any definitive therapies, such expert teams may be optimally positioned to offer patients superior functional and aesthetic outcomes based on maximizing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing treatment-related morbidities."

"Fibromatosis consists of a benign fibroblastic proliferation with local infiltrative growth. Two types are recognized: a superficial and a deep form, also known as desmoid tumor. The latter may occur sporadically or in association with familial adenomatous polyposis and Gardner's syndrome. Pancreatic presentation is exceptional and only eight cases have been described in the literature. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 29-year-old woman with a history of familial colonic polyposis and two pancreatic lesions. In the surgical specimen, two poorly defined pancreatic lesions were observed with infiltration of neighboring organs. Histologically, the lesions corresponded to mesenchymal proliferation with a fusocellular pattern without cytological atypica, which were diagnosed as desmoid tumors. DISCUSSION: The etiology of fibromatosis is unknown. In patients with familial colonic polyposis, the most common localization of desmoid tumor is intra-abdominal. Pancreatic presentation is unusual, requiring differential diagnosis with other pancreatic neoplasms."
"The authors report the case of an adult female patient who developed a thoracic paraspinous desmoid tumor (aggressive fibromatosis) located just cranially to the incision scar of the previous surgery for resection of a spinal schwannoma. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of an extraabdominal desmoid tumor occurring after resection of a spinal schwannoma. Desmoid tumors develop from muscle connective tissue, fasciae and aponeuroses. They are known to occur in association with surgical scars or implants. Incidence of this tumor is low. The etiology is still uncertain. Although rare, this distinctive tumor should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of palpable masses and especially those occurring around the previous skin incisions."
"Desmoid tumors are rare, benign fibromatous lesions that result from the abnormal proliferation of myofibroblasts. A 61-year-old man underwent laparoscopy-assisted right hemicolectomy for ascending colon cancer. The final TNM stage was stage IIIB (T3N1M0). Follow-up computed tomography (CT), done 12 months after primary surgery, showed a nodular, enhancing soft-tissue density mass, 12 mm in size, in the mesentery, near the anastomosis. Another CT scan, done 4 months later, revealed that the tumor had enlarged to 27 mm in size. We suspected locoregional recurrence of colon cancer and resected the tumor, together with the distal ileum and colon, including the previous anastomotic site. The tumor was histologically diagnosed as a desmoid tumor. The patient remains well 24 months after his last operation. Differentiating between the desmoid tumor and locoregional recurrent tumor was difficult, and surgical resection was the optimal treatment."

"Liver-sparing ""modified"" multivisceral transplantation (MMVTx) has recently been more used for patients with diffuse gastrointestinal disorders and preserved hepatic functions. Evisceration techniques with preservation of native spleen were also introduced to reduce risk of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders. This study focuses on the indications of MMVTx for patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and the technical feasibility of performing spleen-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (SPPD). METHODS: Between 1993 and 2009, 10 FAP patients required MMVTx. Nine were adults and one was a child, with a female:male ratio of 1:1. RESULTS: Short gut with duodenal adenomatosis and extensive desmoid tumors with pancreaticoduodenal involvement dictated need for MMVTx. SPPD was technically feasible in four recipients, and conventional evisceration including splenectomy was performed in remaining six recipients. With an overall cumulative survival of 90% at 1 year and 77% at 10 years, all SPPD recipients were alive with no single example of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, graft-versus-host disease, or chronic rejection. However, SPPD was associated with an increase (P>0.3) in total ischemia time, operative time, and packed red blood cells requirement but with shorter (P=0.6) length of hospital stay. With a mean follow-up of 50+/-45 months (range 18-128 months), none of the 10 recipients experienced intraabdominal desmoid tumor recurrence or developed de novo visceral allograft neoplasm. CONCLUSION: MMVTx is a valuable therapeutic option for FAP patients who are in need for visceral transplantation with pathologic involvement of the pancreaticoduodenal complex. SPPD is technically feasible, and efforts should always be made to preserve native spleen because of the reported herein therapeutic advantages."
"Desmoid tumours are rare benign tumours that have local ""malignity"". They can be locally aggressive by infiltrating adjacent vascular, nervous and bony structures. AIM: To define the role of radiotherapy in the management of desmoid tumours. METHODS: Retrospective study of six extra-abdominal desmoid tumours treated with surgery and radiation therapy. RESULTS: Median age was 26.8 years (16-35 years). The tumor was located in the arm (1 case), in the legs (2 cases) and in the body (3 cases). Median tumoral sizes were 86.6 mm (60-100 mm). Five patients had local recurrence after surgical resection. Radiation therapy included Cobalt 60 in five cases and photons associated to linear acceleration in one case. Total dose was between 54 and 62 Gy. At the end of radiation therapy, tumoral control was obtained in five cases after a median follow-up of 26 months (1-83 months). CONCLUSION: Surgery is the main treatment of desmoids tumours but local recurrence rates remain high even after complete resection. The role of adjuvant radiation therapy is controversial."
"Desmoid tumors describe a rare monoclonal, fibroblastic proliferation characterized by a variable and often unpredictable clinical course. Although histologically benign, desmoids are locally invasive and associated with a high local recurrence rate, but lack metastatic potential. On the molecular level, desmoids are characterized by mutations in the beta-catenin gene, CTNNB1, or the adenomatous polyposis coli gene, APC. Proof of a CTNNB1 mutation may be useful when the pathological differential diagnosis is difficult and location might be predictive for disease recurrence. Many issues regarding the optimal treatment of patients with desmoids remain controversial; however, surgery is the therapeutic mainstay, except if mutilating and associated with considerable function loss. Postoperative radiotherapy reduces the local recurrence rate, in cases of involved surgical margins. Because of the heterogeneity of the biological behavior of desmoids, including long periods of stable disease or even spontaneous regression, treatment needs to be individualized to optimize local tumor control and preserve patients' quality of life. Therefore, the application of a multidisciplinary assessment with multimodality treatment forms the basis of care for these patients. Watchful waiting may be the most appropriate management in selected asymptomatic patients. Patients with desmoids located at the mesentery or in the head and neck region could present with life-threatening complications and often need more aggressive treatment. This review describes treatment options and management strategies for patients with desmoid tumors with a focus on advanced disease."
"MCM2, MCM5, MCM7, Ki-67 and AgNORs expression was assessed in paraffin sections from sporadic desmoid tumours using a tissue microarray (TMA)-based immuno- and histochemistry, respectively. Nuclear expression of MCM7, where the percentage of positive cells was 0.87% (+/- 1.64) (range 0-5%), was found in 4/20 (20.0%) cases. In 32/32 (100%) of the examined desmoid cases no expression of nuclear proteins MCM2 and MCM5 was detected. Nuclear expression of Ki-67 was observed in 4/21 (19%) cases. Paraffin sections from 30 cases of desmoid tumours were silver-stained to visualize AgNORs. The following AgNOR parameters were calculated: mean AgNOR number per nucleus (N), mean AgNOR area per nucleus, mean AgNOR dot area per nucleus (A), and mean AgNOR content (C = N/A). In the investigated group the mean values of AgNOR parameters were the following number: 4.34 (+/- 0.11); area: 0.74 mum2 (+/- 0.19); dot area: 0.18 m2 (+/- 0.01), and AgNOR content: 23.73 (+/- 1.85). The mean AgNOR number per nucleus and mean AgNOR content in desmoid tumours were statistically significantly higher as compared to the controls (tonsil tissue) (p<0.001). This study observed low level of MCM7 and Ki-67 and lack of MCM2, MCM5 proteins expression which may explain commonly known low mitotic activity of desmoid tumour cells. The morphology of dots related to AgNORs (number, area) and their morphometric parameters point to elevated transcriptional activity of desmoid cells."
"Desmoplastic fibroblastoma (collagenous fibroma) is a recently described tumor thought to arise predominantly from subcutaneous tissue or skeletal muscle. The natural evolution of this tumor on magnetic resonance imaging has never been described, to the best of our knowledge. We herein report a case of desmoplastic fibroblastoma arising in the thigh and show the longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging findings. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old Japanese man presented with swelling of the medial side of his right thigh, and he complained of nighttime pain and slight tenderness. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a 4 x 4 cm mass in the right thigh. Open biopsy was performed. The mass was diagnosed histologically as a benign fibrous tumor, and we maintained follow-up without surgical therapy. After one year, magnetic resonance imaging showed an increase in tumor size to 4 x 5 cm, but the histologic findings were the same as those obtained one year earlier. Resection was performed with narrow surgical margins. Pathologic diagnosis was desmoplastic fibroblastoma. Two years after surgery, the patient is free from pain and shows no signs or symptoms of recurrence. CONCLUSION: The natural evolution of desmoplastic fibroblastoma is characterized by no changes in patterns on magnetic resonance imaging despite increasing size. This finding is clinically helpful for distinguishing desmoplastic fibroblastoma with increasing pain from the desmoid tumor."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumour) is a locally invasive tumour caused by mutations resulting in beta-catenin protein stabilisation. Apc1638N mice are predisposed to developing aggressive fibromatosis tumours, and male mice develop greater numbers of tumours than female mice, suggesting a role for androgens in this tumour type. METHODS: Human aggressive fibromatosis tumours were examined for the expression of the androgen receptor, and primary human tumour cell cultures were treated with testosterone. Orchidectomised Apc1638N mice were investigated for the development of tumours, and were treated with testosterone to study the effect of tumour formation and the level of beta-catenin. RESULTS: Androgen receptors are universally expressed in human aggressive fibromatosis tumours. Testosterone increased the proliferation rate and beta-catenin protein level in a dose-dependent manner in human aggressive fibromatosis tumours. Orchiectomy reduced the number and size of tumours that formed in male Apc1638N mice to a similar level as observed in female mice. Testosterone treatment increased the number of tumours that formed in orchidectomised male mice, and resulted in a marked increase in beta-catenin protein levels. CONCLUSION: Testosterone regulates beta-catenin protein level and proliferation rate in this mesenchymal tumour. This work identifies the therapeutic use of testosterone blockade in aggressive fibromatosis as an area for further investigation."
"Cholangiocarcinoma complicated by intra-abdominal desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) is uncommon. There are no reports on patients with this type of fibromatosis, in which the pre-operative treatment (including diagnosis), surgical approach, post-operative pathologic reports, and prognosis are discussed. METHOD: The clinicopathological features of a 49-year-old man were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Cholangiocarcinoma located in the inferior segment of the bile duct was considered pre-operatively on the basis of clinical findings. At the time of pancreaticoduodenectomy, the mesojejunum was stiff without nodules or a mass at a distance of approximately 80 cm from the ligament of Treitz. Complete excision of the entire lesion of the intestinal mesenteric contracture and its subsidiary was performed. Post-operative pathologic findings confirmed an adenocarcinoma located at the extremity of the common bile duct and infiltrating the full thickness of the common bile duct as well as the deep muscular layer of the duodenum. The contracted jejunal mesentery was shown to have DTF. The patient was alive with no evidence of recurrence after a follow-up of 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: The patient had a rare hereditary disease with intra-abdominal DTF, which manifests the characteristics of an aggressive growth pattern and a high rate of local recurrence; conservative therapy is recommended. Complete excision of the fibromatous lesion during pancreaticoduodenectomy may maximally decrease the risk of local recurrence."
"The aim of this article was to present a new method of analysis for the assessment of facial growth and morphology after surgical resection of the mandible in a growing patient. METHODS: This was a 2-year longitudinal study of facial growth in a child who had undergone segmental resection of the mandible with immediate reconstruction as a treatment for juvenile aggressive fibromatosis. Three-dimensional digital stereo-photogrammteric cameras were used for image acquisition at several follow-up intervals: immediate, 6 months, and 2 years postresection. After processing and superimposition, shell-to-shell deviation maps were used for the analysis of the facial growth pattern and its deviation from normal growth. The changes were seen as mean surface changes and color maps. An average constructed female face from a previous study was used as a reference for a normal growth pattern. RESULTS: The patient showed significant growth during this period. Positive changes took place around the nose, lateral brow area, and lower lip and chin, whereas negative changes were evident at the lower lips and cheeks area. An increase in the vertical dimension of the face at the chin region was also seen prominently. CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional digital stereo-photogrammetry can be used as an objective, noninvasive method for quantifying and monitoring facial growth and its abnormalities."
A desmoid tumour is slow growing fibromatosis with aggressive infiltration of adjacent tissue and extremely unusual systemic metastases. We report on a female patient aged 25 years who had a mass in lower abdomen for 2 years. There was no previous history of any surgical intervention. Preoperative evaluation included ultrasound and computed tomography. Patient underwent primary resection with wide margins. Histology revealed a desmoid tumour.
"Desmoid tumors (deep fibromatoses) are clonal connective tissue malignancies that do not metastasize, but have a significant risk of local recurrence, and are associated with morbidity and occasionally mortality. Responses of desmoid patients to sorafenib on an expanded access program led us to review our experience. METHODS: After Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, we reviewed data for 26 patients with desmoid tumors treated with sorafenib. Sorafenib was administered at 400 mg oral daily and adjusted for toxicity. RESULTS: Sorafenib was the first-line therapy in 11/26 patients and the remaining 15/26 had received a median of 2 prior lines of therapy. Twenty-three of 26 patients had shown evidence of progressive disease by imaging, whereas 3 patients had achieved maximum benefit or toxicity with chemotherapy. Sixteen of 22 ( approximately 70%) patients reported significant improvement of symptoms. At a median of 6 months (2-29) of treatment, the best response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1 response included 6/24 (25%) patients with partial response (PR), 17/24 (70%) with stable disease, and 1 with progression and death. Twelve of 13 (92%) patients evaluated by MRI had > 30% decrease in T2 signal intensity, an indirect metric for increased fibrosis and loss of cellularity. Eighty percent of patients with radiological benefit had extra-abdominal desmoids. DISCUSSION: Sorafenib is active against desmoid tumors. A prospective, randomized clinical trial of sorafenib against other active agents is warranted. Loss of MRI T2 signal may be a useful surrogate for defining responses, but requires validation by examination of tumor pathology."
"Data regarding the role of chemotherapy (CT) in patients with recurrent and/or unresectable desmoid tumors (DTs) are scarce. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Records of patients with DT who were treated with CT in centers from the French Sarcoma Group were reviewed. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients entered the study. The two most common locations were extremities (35.5%) and internal trunk (32.5%). Twelve patients (19.5%) were diagnosed with Gardner syndrome. Thirty-seven patients (54.7%) received previously one or more lines of systemic therapies (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: 43.5%, antiestrogens: 43.5% and imatinib: 30.5%). Combination CT was delivered in 44 cases (71%) and single agent in 18 patients (29%), respectively. Thirteen patients (21%) received an anthracycline-containing regimen. The most frequent nonanthracycline regimen was the methotrexate-vinblastine combination (n=27). Complete response, partial response, stable disease and progressive disease were observed in 1 (1.6%), 12 (19.4%), 37 (59.6%) and 12 (19.4%) patients, respectively. The response rate was higher with anthracycline-containing regimens: 54% versus 12%, P=0.0011. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 40.8 months. The sole factor associated with improved PFS was the nonlimb location: 12.1 months (95% confidence interval 5.6-18.7) versus not reached, P=0.03. CONCLUSIONS: CT has significant activity in DT. Anthracycline-containing regimens appear to be associated with a higher response rate."
"Desmoids of the chest are extremely rare borderline tumors. Radical surgical resection is considered to be the primary treatment. Achieving negative margins is often a challenge. Cases with positive surgical margins are associated with high risk of local recurrence. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter review was undertaken of 28 patients who underwent surgery for sporadically appearing desmoids of the chest between 1988 and 2008. Clinico-pathological data were investigated in detail. Authors have statistically analyzed the relationships between gender, age, tumor size, radicality of the first surgery, impact of the pharmacologic treatment, estrogen receptor positivity, and the development of local recurrences after a median follow-up period of 104 months. RESULTS: Primary surgery was radical in 14 patients (50%). Mean pathologic diameter was 72.14mm. Wide surgical excision was performed in 27 primary cases, out of which 10 cases (37%) were full- and 17 cases (63%) partial-thickness chest wall resections. Synthetic mesh stabilization was used in nine cases and soft tissue coverage in six patients. Morbidity rate was 25%. Recurrences were found in 63% of the cases, with a mean time of 30.5 months to first recurrences. Our investigation confirmed that microscopically free surgical margin of the first tumor resection significantly affected local tumor control. CONCLUSIONS: Because the radicality of the first surgical resection is of essential importance for long-time local control of chest desmoids, accurate preoperative diagnostics and well-planned aggressive surgical resection of the primary tumor is recommended. Due to the low incidence of desmoids, multicentric randomized investigations would be mandatory to establish evidence-based protocol for desmoid tumors."

"Desmoid tumors are benign but locally aggressive tumors of mesenchymal origin which are poorly circumscribed, infiltrate the surrounding tissue, lack a true capsule and are composed of abundant collagen. History of trauma to the site of tumor origin is elicited in up to 1 in 4 cases and they most commonly develop in the anterior abdominal wall and shoulder girdle but they can arise in any skeletal muscle. The clinical behavior and natural history of desmoid tumors are unpredictable and management is difficult with many issues remaining controversial, mainly regarding early detection, the role, type and timing of surgery and the value of non-operative therapies. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 23 year old male referred from a district hospital to a national referral hospital in Kenya, after developing a huge abdominal wall desmoid tumor following laparotomy for a blunt abdominal injury fourteen months earlier. The tumor was successfully excised and the abdominal wall defect reconstructed using a vicryl/prolene mesh and a unilateral groin flap. The patient had a non-eventful recovery and was discharged through radiotherapy clinic. CONCLUSION: Wide margin tumor excision alone is a reasonable option in the management of desmoid tumors."
"Desmoid tumours are a rare group of tumours arising in the deep musculoaponeurotic structures and although they have no metastatic potential they can be locally aggressive with relapse rates of between 23-40%. Three sub-sites are reported: extra-abdominal, abdominal wall and intra-abdominal. The purpose of this study was to analyze patients with these tumours treated and followed at our institution and to determine factors influencing disease free survival. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 20 patients treated between 1997 and 2009. Data was compiled to include age, gender, surgical history, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), contraceptives, tumour site, first-line treatment, positive margins and adjuvant radiotherapy. A descriptive and survival statistical analysis was also performed. RESULTS: Most patients were women, with a median age of 36 years, with abdominal wall involvement and treated with complete surgery without adjuvant radiotherapy. With a median follow-up of 35 months (range 0-188), local control at 5 years for any kind of treatment was 80%. Overall survival (OS) and 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) were 100% and 86%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Desmoid tumours are group of rare tumours. Although complete surgical resection remains the cornerstone of treatment for resectable lesions, there is still substantial risk of recurrence. Our outcomes are comparable to those reported in the few series published to date."

"49 LGFMSs (all with FUS gene rearrangement confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization), 40 soft tissue perineuriomas, 40 myxofibrosarcomas, 20 cellular myxomas, 20 solitary fibrous tumors, 20 low-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, 20 cases of desmoid fibromatosis, 20 neurofibromas, 20 schwannomas, 20 monophasic synovial sarcomas, 20 cases of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, 10 myxoid liposarcomas, and 10 extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas. The LGFMS cases included 7 with marked hypercellularity, 4 with prominent hemangiopericytoma-like vessels, 3 with giant collagen rosettes, 3 with epithelioid morphology, 2 with focal nuclear pleomorphism, and 2 with areas of sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma. All 49 LGFMS cases (100%) showed cytoplasmic staining for MUC4, which was usually diffuse and intense. All the other tumor types were negative for MUC4, apart from 6 (30%) monophasic synovial sarcomas. In conclusion, MUC4 is a highly sensitive and quite specific immunohistochemical marker for LGFMS, and can be helpful to distinguish this tumor type from histologic mimics."
"Gastrointestinal (GI) mesenchymal tumors other than gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) are rare neoplasms, but they often enter the differential diagnosis of more common GI lesions. Some of these mesenchymal tumors in the GI tract have well understood molecular pathologic aspects, including desmoid tumors, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), clear cell sarcoma (CCS), inflammatory fibroid polyp (IFP), and synovial sarcoma (SS). Molecular pathology is fast becoming a mainstream focus in laboratories because it aids in the precise classification of tumors, may be prognostic, and may help predict response to therapy. The following review is not intended as an exhaustive summary of all mesenchymal tumors that have been reported to involve the GI tract, but instead will highlight the current knowledge of the most important non-GIST GI mesenchymal neoplasms, focusing on those tumors with well-characterized molecular pathology and how the molecular pathologic features impact current diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic standards."
"Desmoid tumors are non-metastatic mesenchymal tumors with an aggressive local growth. Depending on the anatomic location, morbidity varies. We report of a patient with a desmoid tumor of the right shoulder which was treated in our department by surgical excision, plastic-surgical wound closure and postoperative adjuvant radiation."

"Mesenteric fibromatosis or intra-abdominal desmoid tumour is a rare proliferative disease affecting the mesentery. It is a locally aggressive tumour that lacks metastatic potential, but the local recurrence is common. Mesenteric fibromatosis with the intestinal involvement can be easily confused with other primary gastrointestinal tumours, especially with that of the mesenchymal origin. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 44-year-old female who presented with an abdominal mass that radiologically and pathologically mimicked a gastrointestinal stromal tumour. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of mesenteric fibromatosis should always be considered in the case of mesenchymal tumours apparently originating from the bowel wall that diffusely infiltrate the mesentery."
Aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumour) of the breast is a rare tumour that accounts only for 0.2% of primary breast tumours. This is a benign mesenchymal tumour that develops from muscular fasciae and aponeuroses. It is characterized by its local evolution and its tendency to relapse without metastasizing. Wide radical resection should be attempted whenever possible. Positive margins at resection and reoperation are associated with a high risk of local recurrence. The role of radiotherapy and of medical treatments- especially anti-estrogens - remains unclear. We report here the case of desmoid tumour of the breast arising in a 9-year-old little girl.
"Desmoid tumors, also known as aggressive fibromatosis, are tumors of intermediate dignity, which grow slowly but are locally aggressive. These tumors do not metastasize but can be potentially life threatening when infiltrating vital structures. The therapy strategy consists of surgery, radiation and systemic therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antiestrogen compounds and cytotoxic chemotherapy. We report on a 40-year-old male patient with advanced fibromatosis of the neck who has been treated with 7 cycles of polychemotherapy (adriablastin, ifosfamide and dacarbazine) followed by targeted therapy with imatinib. Tumor response was evaluated clinically and by magnetic resonance imaging. The tumor decreased significantly after the first cycle of chemotherapy and tumor-related symptoms declined. The response continued after switching to targeted therapy with imatinib, which is currently ongoing. The best treatment for this rare tumor remains under discussion. Doxorubicin and dacarbazine are frequently used agents. We included ifosfamide in our therapy, which is standard in the treatment of soft tissue tumors. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib seems to offer new possibilities and is currently investigated in randomized trials. We conclude that combination chemotherapy including doxorubicin, ifosfamide and dacarbazine in the treatment of aggressive fibromatosis should be considered for patients suffering from unresectable, advanced disease and clinical symptoms which require a rapid response to therapy."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a benign tumor with a high recurrence rate after surgical resection, particularly in children. Abnormal regulation of beta-catenin in the presence or absence of a change of genotype has been identified in adult sporadic aggressive fibromatosis. However, the status of beta-catenin expression and mutation remains unclear in pediatric patients. The present study was designed to analyze the expression and mutation status of beta-catenin in pediatric aggressive fibromatosis. B-catenin expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 32 samples from pediatric patients with aggressive fibromatosis (21 recurrent cases and 11 primary-onset cases) and 15 control subjects. Somatic point mutations in beta-catenin exon 3 were identified by sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products. Nuclear expression of beta-catenin was detected in 94% (30/32) of aggressive fibromatosis samples and 13% (2/15) of control samples (P < 0.001). Mutations in exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene were identified in 78% (25/32) of aggressive fibromatosis samples (19/21 recurrent cases, 6/11 primary-onset cases; P = 0.032). The primary mutation in the recurrent cases occurred at codon 45 (S45F), while codon 41 (T41A) was most frequently mutated in the primary-onset cases (P = 0.002). Abnormal expression of beta-catenin appears to occur frequently in pediatric aggressive fibromatosis. Muftations in exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene, particularly the S45F mutation, may represent risk factors for recurrence in pediatric patients and could potentially be used as prognostic factors."
"Fibrous or desmoid tumors are grouped under the term fibromatosis; there are several groups; the pediatric aggressive form is rare, especially the pelvis and/or hip presentation. This causes a variable degree of destruction of the surrounding tissues. It is a diagnosis by exclusion and histopathologic testing; treatment is always surgical and conservative treatment is indicated only for special locations and/or patient conditions. This article reports a case of aggressive pediatric hip fibromatosis with severe joint destruction, as well as the work-up and management protocol followed at the National Pediatrics Institute Pediatric Orthopedics Service to approach bone tumors. No cases similar to this one have been reported."
"Desmoid tumours are benign tumours originating from musculoaponeurotic structures and the fascia. They usually are slow-growing, without metastatic potential. However, their local behaviour can be infiltrative and aggressive, leading to damage of adjacent structures causing organ dysfunction. They carry a high risk of relapse. In this paper, three case studies of women aged 33, 35 and 42 years, respectively, illustrate the presentation, diagnostics and therapy of abdominal desmoid tumours. All three were surgically treated and recovered. Desmoid tumours occur most commonly in fertile women. Although the etiology is unknown, there is a correlation with scar tissue, pregnancy and radiotherapy. Abdominal desmoid tumours have the lowest relapse rate of all desmoid tumours. In toto resection is the treatment of choice. Radiotherapy in addition to surgery may be considered when risk of relapse is high."
"The purpose of this study was to describe the MRI features of cortical desmoids associated with acute trauma. CONCLUSION: Marrow edema, periostitis, and adjacent soft-tissue edema can be seen in cases of cortical desmoid associated with acute trauma."

"Primary desmoid-type fibromatoses arising from the oral and maxillofacial region are uncommon and hold the character of local invasion and regional recurrence. The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinicoepidemiologic characteristics of this rare disease in an eastern Chinese population. STUDY DESIGN: Epidemiological and clinicopathological data on 20 patients were reviewed from the hospital records and analyzed accordingly. RESULTS: Twelve males and 8 females with a ratio of 3:2 were involved. The mandible was the most common site of presentation. Suspected malignant change was found in 6 cases and an extremely high recurrence rate was also found in up to 53%. Abnormally high blood levels of alkaline phosphatase were found in 65% of patients, which had a close relation with tumor malignant change. CONCLUSION: Chinese people are more susceptible to desmoid-type fibromatoses and are at an extremely high risk of regional malignant change. Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels may be taken as an indicator for malignant transformation."
"Extra-abdominal desmoid tumors account for 0.03% of all neoplasms and rarely present in the foot. They are benign but locally aggressive, and wide local surgical excision is the treatment of choice owing to the high rate of recurrence in the lower extremities. Invasiveness into the surrounding soft-tissue structures often makes wide excision difficult without compromise of function. We describe a 34-year-old woman with a large, pedal, extra-abdominal desmoid fibroma treated by wide local surgical excision with minimal complications postoperatively and no clinical evidence of recurrence at 28 months."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a fibroblastic proliferation that develops in the deep soft tissues and is characterized by infiltrative growth and a tendency towards local recurrence but does not metastasize. Fibromatosis of the chest wall is rare, representing only 10 to 20% of all deep fibromatoses. CASE REPORT: We report a six cases series of fibromatosis of the chest wall treated at our institution between 1996 and 2009. There were five men and one woman with a mean age of 42.2. Swelling of the chest wall was the most frequent symptom. Imaging showed an expansive homogeneous mass, invading the rib (four cases) or the sternum (two cases). Surgical resection was performed in all cases. The outcome was favorable (five cases) or marked by local recurrence (one case). DISCUSSION: Although it is considered to be a benign lesion, this tumor can be locally very aggressive, and has a high local recurrence rate depending upon the efficacy of surgical resection."
"Pseudosarcomatous nodular fasciitis and desmoid tumors can be very similar at physical examination. Although their behaviours and cytologic aspects are very different, they both undergo the same surgical approach. Nevertheless, only desmoid tumors - because of their high rate of local recurrence - require a strict follow-up and further therapies when radicality of primary surgery could not be likely performed."
"Desmoid tumors constitute one of the most important extraintestinal manifestations of familial adenomatous polyposis. The development of desmoids is responsible for increasing morbidity and mortality rates in cases of familial adenomatous polyposis. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the occurrence of desmoid tumors in familial adenomatous polyposis cases following prophylactic colectomy and to present patient outcome. METHODS: Between 1984 and 2008, 68 patients underwent colectomy for familial adenomatous polyposis at the School of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital, University of Campinas, SP, Brazil. Desmoid tumors were found in nine (13.2%) of these patients, who were studied retrospectively by consulting their medical charts with respect to clinical and surgical data. RESULTS: Of nine patients, seven (77.8%) were submitted to laparotomy for tumor resection. Median age at the time of surgery was 33.9 years (range 22-51 years). Desmoid tumors were found in the abdominal wall in 3/9 cases (33.3%) and in an intra-abdominal site in the remaining six cases (66.7%). Median time elapsed between ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and diagnosis of desmoid tumor was 37.5 months (range 14-60 months), while the median time between colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis and diagnosis was 63.7 months (range 25-116 months). In 6/9 (66.7%) patients with desmoid tumors, the disease was either under control or there was no evidence of tumor recurrence at a follow-up visit made a mean of 63.1 months later (range 12-240 months). CONCLUSIONS: Desmoid tumors were found in 13.2% of cases of familial adenomatous polyposis following colectomy; therefore, familial adenomatous polyposis patients should be followed-up and surveillance should include abdominal examination to detect signs and symptoms. Treatment options include surgery and clinical management with antiestrogens, antiinflammatory drugs or chemotherapy."

"Optimal surgical and medical therapy for the treatment of desmoid tumors (DT) is still undefined. Partial response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) has previously been described. Here, we examined the role of the tyrosine kinases c-Src and c-Kit in driving desmoid tumorigenesis. METHODS: Six consecutive DT and matched normal tissues were collected from the operating room. Tissues were embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemical analysis, and protein lysates were prepared for immunoblot and immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: We found increased levels of beta-catenin in five of six (83%) DT relative to matched normal tissue by immunoblot analysis. By immunohistochemistry, beta-catenin expression was also increased in DT and localized to the nucleus. In contrast, we observed variable levels of total and activated c-Src and c-Kit expression in DT compared with normal tissue. Finally, beta-catenin tyrosine phosphorylation (p-Y) among tumors was variably increased, despite the increased amount of total beta-catenin in tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that c-Src and c-Kit activity in DT is variable, consistent with the heterogeneous nature of this disease. Clinical response to TKI in DT may be via alternative mechanisms unrelated to c-Src or c-Kit activity. Further insight into DT biology will help identify novel drug regimens to limit the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease."
"Fibromatosis, or extra-abdominal desmoid tumor, is a benign disease which often has an aggressive clinical course that can be difficult to treat. We performed a retrospective review of 16 patients (12 females and four males) with a mean age of 34.2 years treated with methotrexate and vinblastine for newly diagnosed or recurrent extra-abdominal desmoid tumor. The mean age of our patient cohort was 34.2 years (range 11-70), and the mean tumor size was 11.5 cm (range 2.5-21.2 cm). The mean duration of therapy was 12 months with an average follow-up of 43 months (range 1-149 months). Fourteen of 16 patients demonstrated a clinical response to treatment. Eight of 14 patients demonstrated a radiologic decrease in tumor size. Only one patient progressed on therapy. Six patients developed recurrent symptoms after discontinuation of treatment. Chemotherapy-related symptoms including neutropenia, nausea, and vomiting were common and observed in most patients, however these side effects were mild and transient. Five patients developed peripheral neuropathy that prompted a change from vinblastine to vinorelbine during treatment. One potentially life-threatening complication (pneumocystis pneumonia) occurred which was diagnosed early and successfully treated. The use of methotrexate and vinblastine/vinorelbine in the management of fibromatosis appears to be an effective treatment with minimal treatment-related side effects."
"Extra-abdominal desmoid tumors are circumscribed but non-capsulated neoplasms of differentiated fibrous tissue arising from musculoaponeurotic tissues. They tend to be locally infiltrative, resulting in a high rate of local recurrence without metastasis, following surgical resection. We report a 9-year-old boy who had a large desmoid tumor in his right buttock that was successfully excised."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a rare soft tissue tumor. Although it lacks metastatic potential, it can grow aggressively in a locally infiltrating pattern. The tumors frequently recur after surgical excision, which remains the treatment of choice. Optional combinations of radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy have been used postoperatively for recurrent disease and/or inoperable cases. A palpable mass was detected in the popliteal fossa of the right lower extremity in a 48-year-old man. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a contrast-enhancing noncalcified lesion initially felt to represent a vascular tumor. An invasive mass adherent to the surrounding tissue was visualized intraoperatively and extensively debulked. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. Histologic examination of the surgical specimen was consistent with an extra-abdominal desmoid tumor. After appropriate recognition, wide local excision may be the most appropriate treatment for fibromatosis of the extremity. However, the rarity of this tumor and the difficulty inherent in distinguishing it from similar-appearing tumors are necessitating histologic confirmation of the diagnosis."
"To evaluate the usefulness of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for differentiating between desmoid tumors and malignant soft tissue tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Conventional MRI and DWI were performed for 8 desmoid tumors and 74 malignant soft tissue tumors. DWI was obtained with a single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence using a 1.5 Tesla (T) MR imager. DW images were acquired with motion-probing gradient pulses applied along three directions (x, y, and z axes) with three b-factors (0, 500, and 1000 s/mm(2)). Two observers blinded to clinical information measured three regions of interest within the solid tumor and selected a minimum apparent diffusion coefficient () in each lesion. The mean ADC of desmoid tumors was calculated and compared with that of malignant soft tissue tumors using the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: The mean ADC of desmoid tumors and malignant soft tissue tumors was 1.36 +/- 0.48 x 10(-)(3) mm(2) /s and 0.88 +/- 0.20 x 10(-)(3) mm(2) /s (mean +/- SD), respectively. The mean ADC of the desmoid tumors was significantly higher than that of malignant soft tissue tumors (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: DWI is considered to be useful for differentiating between desmoid tumors and malignant soft tissue tumors. In the future, further investigation in a large series is necessary."
"Chest wall desmoids are rare, borderline tumors. Radical surgical excision is considered to be the primary treatment. Tendency of desmoids to infiltrate the chest wall, the shoulder girdle, lung parenchyma, brachial plexus and vital components of the mediastinum provides a difficult surgical challenge in the efforts of achieving microscopically negative margins. Implantation of synthetic meshes and reconstructive plastic surgical techniques might be necessary to perform in order to preserve stability of the thorax, and to achieve optimal functional and aesthetic results. Multidisciplinary surgeries may result in a high rate of morbidity even in specialized centers. Within the framework of a retrospective multicenter review, authors assessed surgical techniques implemented in the case of patients who underwent surgical management for sporadically appearing chest-wall and intra-thoracic desmoids, and reviewed the relevant literature."
"Becker nevus is a nevoid melanosis, referred to as Becker nevus syndrome when it is associated with other anomalies. Our objectives were to report the occurrence of a Becker nevus with an underlying desmoid soft-tissue tumor; to review Mayo Clinic's experience with Becker nevi, concentrating on Becker nevi associated with bone, vascular, neural, and other soft-tissue abnormalities; to inform physicians of the Becker nevus syndrome; and finally to alert clinicians to evaluate a Becker nevus with its associations in mind. OBSERVATIONS: A 46-year-old woman had a Becker nevus with an underlying desmoid-type fibromatosis (desmoid tumor) presenting clinically as a ""painful dimple"" within the nevus. Review of medical records for 1997 through 2006 at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, yielded 52 patients with Becker nevi, 12 of whom had an associated bone, vascular, neural, congenital, or other soft-tissue abnormality, ranging from liposarcoma to an accessory areola. CONCLUSIONS: We add to the literature a unique case of desmoid-type fibromatosis immediately beneath a Becker melanosis, which presented as a painful dimple. We hope to raise awareness that a Becker nevus may be associated with other abnormalities, including an infiltrative soft-tissue tumor. We also emphasize the importance of follow-up, including inspection of not only the surface but also the deep tissues underlying the Becker nevus."
"Although rare in children, aggressive fibromatosis or desmoid tumors require wide surgical excision for durable relief. The resultant defect poses many challenges for reconstruction. The authors report reconstruction of such a wound using a pedicled omental split skin graft, which resulted from the excision of a locally recurrent desmoid tumor."
"Desmoid tumors are uncommon benign neoplasm of the fibroblasts. They occur rarely in the general population, but they are comparatively common in patients with familial polyposis coli with or without other elements of Gardner's syndrome. Herein, we report a 16-year-old woman with Gardner's syndrome complicated by desmoid tumors on the right subscapular area."
"A 6-year-old girl was referred to Eppendorf University Hospital because of a suspected malignant mandibular tumour. An osteolytic lesion was depicted on panoramic radiograph in the premolar region. The tumour was resected with covering skin and the defect was closed by primary intention. Histological investigation revealed fibromatosis. No local recurrence of infantile fibromatosis occurred during seven years of follow-up. The differential diagnosis of fibro-osseous lesion of the facial region is challenging. Especially in children, caution should be exercised in the treatment of benign lesions that resemble malignant conditions derived from connective tissue, with special reference to long-term follow-up."
"We present a case of a rare and unusual occurrence of a desmoid tumor at the site of a resected gastrointestinal stromal tumor and mimicking a recurrence, with a brief discussion of the management of desmoid tumors."
"Fibromatosis is a proliferation of fibroblastic and miofibroblastic cells that primarily originate from the fascia or aponeuroses of the abdominal wall. This entity has no potential metastatic risk, but can reappear locally. In rare cases it may develop in the breast, and it is extremely uncommon in the male breast. Fibromatosis of the breast presents clinical, mammographic and ultrasound signs of malignancy, and it can only be confirmed through histological analysis. We present the case of a 52-year-old man with a palpable and painless nodule in the right breast of 2 months' evolution with radiological signs of malignancy. The histological analysis determined that this was due to fibromatosis."
"The purpose of this study was to assess the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of aggressive fibromatosis in the head and neck. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients with aggressive fibromatosis who underwent surgical interventions during the 9-year period from 2001 to 2010. Aggressive fibromatosis is treated by resection with an adequate safety margin. Radiotherapy is given to patient with tumor that cannot be completely removed. RESULTS: Four patients with aggressive fibromatosis were identified under the 2005 World Health Organization classification guidelines, which, here reported, have been surgically treated. The lesions were located in the buccal mucosa in 1 patient, the tongue in 1 patient, and neck in 2 patients. Then, they were all treated by aggressive local resection. One patient who had a partially resected tumor underwent radiotherapy. The follow-up period ranged from 7 to 107 months. CONCLUSIONS: For the cases of tumor that can be completely removed, the prognosis is excellent. Otherwise, the tumor is vulnerable to relapse. We recommend radiotherapy in patients who have unresectable or partially resected tumor when the tumor is adjacent to vital structures. Patients with aggressive fibromatosis should remain in long-term follow-up."
"Desmoid tumor is characterized by infiltrative growth and local recurrence often occurs after surgery. To reduce the local recurrence rate, adjuvant therapy, such as radiotherapy and pharmacotherapy with cytotoxic agents, anti-estrogen agents and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, is often applied. In addition, these non-surgical treatments are also performed in patients with unresectable desmoid tumors. We successfully treated a patient with a desmoid tumor with tranilast; an anti-allergic agent. CASE PRESENTATION: A 48-year-old Japanese man with a slow-growing desmoid tumor on his chest wall was treated with an oral administration of tranilast (300 mg per day, three times a day). Two years and two months after the commencement of his therapy, the tumor became impalpable. At this time, the oral administration of tranilast was discontinued. Two years after discontinuation of the treatment, a physical examination showed no recurrence of the tumor and he continued in a state of remission. We were successfully able to reduce the size of the tumor and thereafter maintain the reduced size. CONCLUSION: Tranilast was clinically effective in our case, and is probably comparable to cytotoxic agents or anti-estrogen agents. Because tranilast has substantially fewer adverse effects than cytotoxic agents, it could be a very useful therapeutic agent for desmoid tumor."
"Germline mutations within the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene are responsible for most cases of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal dominantly inherited predisposition to colorectal cancer. To date more than 900 different APC germline mutations have been characterized worldwide demonstrating allelic heterogeneity. Here, we analyzed the APC gene in 23 DNA samples from unrelated Korean patients with the typical clinical symptoms of FAP by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and direct sequencing. We identified 20 different APC sequence variants, including 9 truncating mutations, 1 missense mutation, 7 polymorphisms, and 3 intronic variants. Nine different truncating mutations, including four novel mutations (p.Leu180TyrfsX5, p.Gly567X, p.Ser1275PhefsX13, p.Leu1280CysfsX8), were detected. The most common mutation was a 5 bp deletion at codon 1,309 (p.Glu1309AspfsX4) as in Western studies. The next most common mutation was p.Ser1275PhefsX13 with a severe form of FAP with many extracolonic manifestations; this was a novel mutation identified in our study and may represent the second hot-spot mutation in a Korean population. Novel mutations are of particular interest because of the unusual phenotypic features shown by patients. In present study, we found new positions associated with thyroid cancer (codon 180) and desmoid tumor (codon 1,280), which have not been previously reported. The results of this molecular study have revealed the existence of novel pathogenic mutations in Korean patients with FAP. In addition to allowing phenotype-genotype correlations to be performed, these results are currently being used in genetic counseling and in patient care."

"To explore the computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of desmoid-type fibromatosis, and improve the diagnostic accuracy and understanding of the disease. METHODS: The CT and MRI features of 18 cases of surgically and pathologically confirmed desmoid-type fibromatosis were reviewed retrospectively. Among the patients, 10 received CT pre- and post-contrast scanning, and 8 patients had MRI pre- and post-contrast scanning. The CT and MRI features were analyzed in comparison with the pathological findings. RESULTS: In the extra abdominal cases, the tumors occurred in the head and neck in 3, in the dorsal part of the chest in 2, in the abdominal wall and groin area in 9, and in the peritoneal cavity in 4; concomitant Gardner syndrome was found in 1 case. In 4 cases the tumor occurred within 1 to 3 years after abdominal surgeries. Pathologically, the lesion was hard and composed of fusiform fibroblasts and myofibroblast. The cells showed no obvious heteromorphism with few karyokinesis, growing invasively and recurrent locally but without distant metastasis. Immunohistochemically, the fibroblasts and myofibroblasts expressed vimentin, and the myofibroblasts were positive for SMA. On CT and MRI, the lesion appeared benign with malignant growth pattern, and caused compression of the adjacent organs and vessels or encasement of the vessels; the border was unclear without encapsulation, and necrosis and calcification was scarce. The density and signal of the tumor were well distributed. Twelve patients displayed obvious enhancement and 5 showed uneven enhancement. CONCLUSION: The CT and MRI features of desmoid-type fibromatosis are characteristic, and CT and MRI are valuable modalities for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of the tumor."
"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease characterized by multiple colorectal adenomatous polyps and frequent extracolonic manifestations. An attenuated form of FAP (AFAP) is diagnosed based on a milder colorectal phenotype, and the colorectal phenotype of (A)FAP has been linked to germline APC mutations. The relationships between the spectrum of mutations and extracolonic manifestations are quite well known, but they need to be further defined. FINDINGS: Nine germline APC mutations, but no large deletions, were identified in the APC locus of 8 (A)FAP patients, and 5 of the mutations, c.446A > T (p.Asp149Val), c.448A > T (p.Lys150X), c.454_457insAGAA (p.Glu152ArgfsX17), c.497insA (p.Thr166AsnfsX2), and c.1958G > C (p.Arg653Ser), were novel mutations. In one patient the p.Asp149Val mutation and p.Lys150X mutation were detected in the same APC allele. The c.1958G > C mutation was located in the last nucleotide of exon 14, and RT-PCR analysis revealed that the mutation resulted in abnormal splicing. The above findings meant that a nonsense mutation, a frameshift mutation, or an exonic mutation leading to abnormal splicing was found in every patient. The following phenotypes, especially extracolonic manifestations, were observed in our (A)FAP patients: (1) multiple gastroduodenal adenomas and early-onset gastric carcinoma in AFAP patients with an exon 4 mutation; (2) a desmoid tumor in two FAP patients with a germline APC mutation outside the region between codons 1403 and 1578, which was previously reported to be associated with the development of desmoid tumors in FAP patients; (3) multiple myeloma in an AFAP patient with an exon 4 mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Nine germline APC mutations, 5 of them were novel, were identified in 8 Japanese (A)FAP patients, and some associations between germline APC mutations and extracolonic manifestations were demonstrated. These findings should contribute to establishing relationships between germline APC mutations and the extracolonic manifestations of (A)FAP patients in the future."
"Extra-abdominal desmoid fibromatosis (EADF) is a benign tumoral condition, classically managed by more or less radical and sometimes mutilating excision. This treatment strategy is associated with a recurrence rate of nearly 50% according to various reports. HYPOTHESIS: EADF may show spontaneous stabilization over time. METHODS: A retrospective series of 26 cases of EADF managed by simple observation was studied to assess spontaneous favorable evolution and identify possible factors impacting evolution. Eleven cases were of primary EADF with no treatment or surgery, and 15 of recurrence after surgery with no adjuvant treatment. MRI was the reference examination during follow-up. RESULTS: Twenty-four cases showed stabilization at a median 14 months; there were no cases of renewed evolution after stabilization. One primary tumor showed spontaneous regression, and one recurrence still showed evolution at end of follow-up (23 months). The sole factor impacting potential for evolution was prior surgery. No radiologic or pathologic criteria of evolution emerged from analysis. DISCUSSION: The present series, one of the largest dedicated to EADF managed by observation, confirmed recent literature findings: a conservative ""wait-and-see"" attitude is reasonable and should be considered when large-scale resection would entail significant functional or esthetic impairment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, retrospective study."
"The optimal treatment of desmoid tumours is controversial. We evaluated desmoid management in Dutch familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients. METHODS: Seventy-eight FAP patients with desmoids were identified from the Dutch Polyposis Registry. Data on desmoid morphology, management, and outcome were analysed retrospectively. Progression-free survival (PFS) rates and final outcome were compared for surgical vs non-surgical treatment, for intra-abdominal and extra-abdominal desmoids separately. Also, pharmacological treatment was evaluated for all desmoids. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 8 years. For intra-abdominal desmoids (n=62), PFS rates at 10 years of follow-up were comparable after surgical and non-surgical treatment (33% and 49%, respectively, P=0.163). None of these desmoids could be removed entirely. Eventually, one fifth died from desmoid disease. Most extra-abdominal and abdominal wall desmoids were treated surgically with a PFS rate of 63% and no deaths from desmoid disease. Comparison between NSAID and anti-estrogen treatment showed comparable outcomes. Four of the 10 patients who received chemotherapy had stabilisation of tumour growth, all after doxorubicin combination therapy. CONCLUSION: For intra-abdominal desmoids, a conservative approach and surgery showed comparable outcomes. For extra-abdominal and abdominal wall desmoids, surgery seemed appropriate. Different pharmacological therapies showed comparable outcomes. If chemotherapy was given for progressively growing intra-abdominal desmoids, most favourable outcomes occurred after combinations including doxorubicin."

"The authors describe the concomitant presence of plantar fibromatosis and Dupuytren's disease in a 33-year-old man. A lesion located under the sesamoid bones of the first metatarsophalangeal joint on the right showed an aggressive tendency (rapid growth, pain, impossibility to put weight on the medial side of the foot). Another lesion located proximal to the first one was smaller and painless. Neither plain radiography nor computed tomography showed any structural changes of the skeleton. Contrast-enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging revealed two lesions on the sole of the foot. Since a concurrence of plantar fibromatosis and malignant tumour could not be ruled out, an excision of both lesions and the adjacent plantar aponeurosis was made for biopsy examination. The operative procedure was carried out from two incisions.The intra-operative findings included proliferative growth and bleeding in the lesion located under the first metatarsophalangeal joint, and delimited growth without noticeable bleeding in the other lesion. Based on histological examination, the diagnosis of plantar fibromatosis was made for both lesions.The differential diagnosis and therapy of plantar fibromatosis is discussed."

"Sarcomatoid neoplasms of the lung and pleura are rare tumors that present a complex differential diagnosis, making them challenging for surgical pathologists. In the lung, the main tumors are the sarcomatoid carcinomas, including pleomorphic carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, giant cell carcinoma, carcinosarcoma, and pulmonary blastoma. They are characterized by histologic heterogeneity; molecular data support their origin from a pluripotent stem cell that undergoes neoplastic transformation with divergent epithelial and sarcomatous differentiation. Diagnosis is difficult in small biopsy specimens and typically requires a resection specimen. Despite the presence of sarcomatoid features, these tumors are classified as lung carcinomas. Pulmonary blastomas must be distinguished from pleuropulmonary blastomas, which are a unique type of thoracic sarcoma typically occurring in young children. In the pleura, the main tumors to consider are the sarcomatoid and desmoplastic types of malignant mesothelioma, solitary fibrous tumor, and desmoid tumor. While light microscopy is sufficient to diagnose most of these tumors, immunohistochemistry can be useful in selected settings. In particular, it can aid to confirm epithelial differentiation in spindle cell carcinomas and the presence of rhabdomyosarcoma in sarcomatoid carcinomas, mesotheliomas, or pleuropulmonary blastomas. For sarcomatoid and desmoplastic mesothelioma, keratin is the most useful stain because it can highlight invasive growth and mesothelial markers are positive in only the minority of cases. Clinical and radiologic correlation is needed to separate some pleomorphic carcinomas with pleural involvement from sarcomatoid malignant mesothelioma, since these poorly differentiated tumors may not express the usual immunohistochemical markers for carcinoma or mesothelioma."
"Infantile myofibroma (myofibromatosis) (IM) is a mesenchymal tumor of soft tissues of the head, extremities and trunk. It is characterized by relapse-free infiltrative growth. It consists of neoplastic myofibroblasts at varying stage of cell differentiation which form multi-structured tumor zones. IM's morphological differentiated diagnosis is established vis-a-vis other varieties of tumor and reactive nodular structures of fibroblasts, primarily, infantile hemangiopericytomas and desmoid fibromatosis. Immunohistological and ultrastructural examination of tumor is required for making correct diagnosis of IM."
"We assessed the concordance among seven general pathologists with respect to histologic diagnosis and interpretation of c-kit proto-oncogene (KIT) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) immunostaining of 36 cases of primary spindle-cell tumor, predominantly of the gastrointestinal tract, mesentery, and retroperitoneum, based on review of a tissue microarray (TMA) subjected to immunohistochemistry with antibodies to KIT/CD117, PDGFRA, vimentin, desmin, smooth muscle action, CD34, and S-100 protein. Tumors included 20 molecularly analyzed gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), 4 leiomyosarcomas, 4 schwannomas, 4 desmoid-type fibromatoses, and 4 solitary fibrous tumors. The mean overall concordance with original diagnosis for each histologic type was 91.1%, with a mean kappa value of 0.91. With respect to PDGFRA immunostaining, the four GISTs with PDGFRA mutation were interpreted as cytoplasm positive, but the 16 GISTs with c-kit mutation were interpreted as weak or positive. These results indicate that the overall concordance with original diagnosis in mesenchymal tumors with the use of immunohistochemical panels is high, despite the use of TMAs. To some extent, PDGFRA immunophenotyping may be useful in GISTs with PDGFRA mutation, but it was not highly reproducible or specific. Therefore, in KIT-negative or weakly positive GISTs, mutation analysis will be required."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis, aggressive fibromatosis, or desmoid tumor is an uncommon benign but locally aggressive fibroblastic lesion. Although intraabdominal desmoid-type fibromatoses are well described in association with adenomatous polyposis syndrome, their occurrence along the neuraxis is extremely rare. The authors report the case of a 14-year-old boy with metachronous intracranial and spinal desmoid-type fibromatoses with preceding medulloblastoma. He was ultimately diagnosed with adenomatous polyposis syndrome. This is the first reported case of spinal desmoid-type fibromatosis in association with adenomatous polyposis syndrome. The identification of an underlying genetic instability allows for screening to detect lesions and institute measures to avoid preventable mortality from nonneurological tumors."
"Desmoid tumours are benign fibrous neoplasms originating from musculoaponeurotic structures throughout the body. These tumours are rare in the mandible and the literature is limited to case reports and retrospective reviews and to date there is no agreed protocol for the management of these lesions in the paediatric mandible. The definition, diagnosis and management of juvenile fibromatosis still presents a challenge to the modern surgeon, radiologist and pathologist. We describe a case of paediatric mandibular infantile fibromatosis which presented a diagnostic dilemma, and review the currently available literature."
"We conducted a systematic chart review to identify all infants with fibromatosis colli who had been seen at Children's Hospital in Boston from January 1999 through December 2004. We found 7 such cases, which involved 4 boys and 3 girls, aged 1 to 3.5 weeks at presentation. We compiled information on each patient's birth history, presenting signs and symptoms, significant medical history, imaging findings, management, follow-up, and outcome. Six of the 7 patients presented with a neck mass, and the remaining patient presented with neck ""fullness."" Five patients developed torticollis at some point. All patients were treated conservatively with physiotherapy. Five patients experienced a complete resolution of signs and symptoms, and the other 2 experienced improvement. Based on our findings, we recommend that early management of fibromatosis colli include observation and physiotherapy to prevent or reverse torticollis and the craniofacial asymmetry that can result. Similarly attractive is the opportunity that physiotherapy provides for parents to involve themselves in the care of their newborn. It is important, therefore, to quickly identify fibromatosis colli as such in order to avoid unnecessary expenditures of resources and to promptly begin conservative treatment."
"The cellular origins from which most tumors arise are poorly defined, especially in mesenchymal neoplasms. Aggressive fibromatosis, also known as desmoid tumor, is a locally invasive soft tissue tumor that has mesenchymal characteristics. We found that aggressive fibromatosis tumors express genes and cell surface markers characteristic of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). In mice that are genetically predisposed to develop aggressive fibromatosis tumors (Apc(wt/1638N)), we found that the number of tumors formed was proportional to the number of MSCs present. Sca-1(-/-) mice, which develop fewer MSCs, were crossed with Apc(wt/1638N) mice. Doubly mutant mice deficient in Sca-1 developed substantially fewer aggressive fibromatosis tumors than wild-type (WT) littermates, but Sca-1 deficiency had no effect on the formation of epithelial-derived intestinal polyps. MSCs isolated from Apc(wt/1638N) mice (or mice expressing a stabilized form of beta-catenin) induced aberrant cellular growth reminiscent of aggressive fibromatosis tumors after engraftment to immunocompromised mice, but WT cells and mature fibroblasts from the same animals did not. Taken together, our findings indicate that aggressive fibromatosis is derived from MSCs, and that beta-catenin supports tumorigenesis by maintaining mesenchymal progenitor cells in a less differentiated state. Protecting this progenitor cell population might prevent tumor formation in patients harboring a germline APC mutation, where fibromatosis is currently the leading cause of mortality."
"Desmoid-type fibromatoses are neoplasms of fibroblastic origin, occurring sporadically or associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) coli. By comparing sporadic and FAP-associated desmoid-type fibromatoses, we tried to identify clinical characteristics, which may indicate FAP. Histopathology data of all Dutch patients with desmoid-type fibromatoses diagnosed between 1999 and 2009 were retrieved from PALGA, the nation-wide network and registry of histopathology in the Netherlands. For calculation of incidence rates, person-years from the general matched population were used. Based on polyp counts in pathological records, the cohort was divided into a FAP group and a non-FAP group. Patient- and tumor characteristics were compared between the two groups. A total number of 519 patients older than 10 years with a confirmed diagnosis of desmoid-type fibromatoses were included. Thirty-nine (7.5%) desmoid patients were documented of having FAP. The incidences of sporadic and FAP-related desmoid-type fibromatoses were 3.42 and 2,784 per million person-years, respectively. The majority of FAP patients developed desmoid-type fibromatoses after the diagnosis of FAP. Having FAP was associated with male gender [odds ratio (OR) 2.0, p = 0.034], desmoid diagnosis at an earlier age (mean 36 vs. 42 years, p = 0.031), and desmoid localization intra-abdominally (OR 18.9, p </= 0.001) or in the abdominal wall (OR 4.8, p </= 0.001), compared to extra-abdominal desmoid localization. In conclusion, patients with desmoid-type fibromatoses are at risk of underlying FAP. Especially cases with desmoid localization intra-abdominal or in the abdominal wall, and all patients younger than 60 years, have a substantial increased risk and should be referred for colonoscopy."
"wide-spectrum cytokeratin (CK), EMA, high molecular weight CK, S100, Melan A, HMB-45, CD34, TLE1, CD31, HHV8, smooth muscle actin, desmin, ALK1, CD99, Myo-D1, myogenin, c-kit, INI1, CD21, p63, calretinin, WT1, and TTF1. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for SYT gene rearrangement was done in 6 putative CK-negative synovial sarcomas (SS). Revised diagnoses were based on clinical, morphologic, IHC, and molecular findings. The original group of putative FS occurred in 84 males and 79 females (median 52.5 y, range 2 to 99 y), and involved various anatomic sites. Only 26 cases met WHO criteria for FS, including 2 postradiation FS. These occurred in 16 males and 10 females (median 50 y, range 6 to 74 y), and involved the lower extremities (12 cases), head/ neck (5 cases), trunk (4 cases), upper extremities (3 case), and mediastinum/abdomen (2 cases). Clinical follow-up information was available for 24 of 26 (92%) cases, with a median of 5 years follow-up (range <1 to 35 y). Twelve patients (50%) died of locally aggressive and/or metastatic disease (median follow-up 1-year; range <1 to 8 y), 6 patients (25%) were alive without disease (median follow-up 11.5 y; range 2.5 to 35 y), and 6 patients (25%) died of other causes (median follow-up 10 y; range 9 to 18 y) (). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was positive for SYT gene rearrangement in all cases tested. Non-FS (137 cases) were reclassified as: undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (32 cases), SS (21 cases), solitary fibrous tumor (14 cases), myxofibrosarcoma (11 cases), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (8 cases), FS dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, and desmoplastic melanoma (4 cases each), low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, sarcomatoid carcinoma, desmoid-type fibromatosis, rhabdomyosarcoma, myofibroblastic sarcoma, spindle-cell liposarcoma (3 cases each), sclerosing epithelioid FS, fibroma-like epithelioid sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, cellular fibrous histiocytoma (2 cases each), and others (17 cases). Using modern diagnostic criteria with ancillary IHC and molecular genetics, we have been able to reclassify 84% of putative FS. Exclusive of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, the distinction of which from FS is subjective, 64% of putative FS were reclassified, most commonly as monophasic SS and solitary fibrous tumor. We conclude that true FS is exceedingly rare, accounting for <1% of approximately 10,000 adult soft tissue sarcomas seen at our institution during this time period, and should be diagnosed with great caution."
"Desmoid tumour is a non-encapsulated locally invasive tumour, originating from fibroblasts, which has ubiquitous distribution in the body. It has a high tendency for local recurrence, causing deformity in the adjacent organ and consequent organ dysfunction. A case of a 75-year-old man, presenting with high-grade fever, dull aching abdominal pain and weight loss, suspected to be due to malignancy, is reported. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) showed a mass in the transverse colon with pericolic collection raising a suspicion of perforation. He underwent a two-stage procedure in the form of defunctioning ileostomy in the initial setting followed by colonic resection and anastomosis 6 weeks later. Histological analysis revealed mesenteric fibromatosis (desmoid tumour). The patient was completely asymptomatic one year after surgery. We report this case, as our patient had none of the predisposing factors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case on colonic perforation secondary to desmoid tumour."
"Pediatric myofibroblastic tumors comprise a clinically and pathologically heterogeneous group of neoplasms, including benign tumors, those of intermediate biologic potential, and frankly malignant examples (Box 1). Proper classification is critical for appropriate prognostication, clinical management, and, in some cases, identification of familial syndromes. Unlike for many other soft tissue tumors, immunohistochemistry plays a limited role in the diagnosis of pediatric myofibroblastic tumors, with notable exceptions. Understanding the molecular genetics underlying the pathogenesis of several tumor types in this group has led to improved tools for diagnosis. This article discusses the clinical and pathologic features of myofibroblastic tumors in children, with special emphasis on differential diagnosis."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) is a locally invasive proliferative disease. The mainstay of treatment is surgery. Chemotherapy may be considered in inoperable AF following failure of hormonal therapy and/or NSAIDs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective search of the prospectively maintained Royal Marsden Hospital Sarcoma Unit database to identify patients with AF treated with chemotherapy between 1987 and 2009. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients, thirty one females and eight males, received one or more lines of chemotherapy. The most frequently employed chemotherapy regimens were methotrexate/vinblastine [MTX/VBL] (18) and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin [PLD] (14). MTX/VBL was administered weekly or every two weeks at MTX 50 mg and VBL 10 mg. Treatment duration ranged from three weeks to one year with a median of 4.5 months. Partial response (PR) was observed in 11% of cases, disease stabilisation (SD) in 60% and progressive disease (PD) in 22%. Time to progression ranged from one month to sixteen years. The main toxicities reported were mucositis (4), peripheral neuropathy (3), vomiting (3), and neutropenia (3). PLD was administered at 40-50 mg/m(2) every four weeks, for up to six cycles. PR was achieved in 33% and in the remainder the disease was stable with no progression during treatment. Three (25%) patients have so far progressed after treatment. Symptomatic benefit, especially pain relief, was reported in 86% (12/14) of cases. Main toxicities included palmar plantar erythema (5) and mucositis (4). DISCUSSION: MTX/VBL remains a useful combination but PLD is emerging as a well tolerated and effective systemic therapy in advanced AF."
"The treatment of soft tissue sarcomas of limbs should be discussed within an experienced multimodality team. Surgical resection remains the cornerstone of therapy for localized disease and achieves a five years overall survival around 75% and a local recurrence rate as low as 10% in the best series. In complex cases, neo-adjuvant treatments may be used such as systemic chemotherapy, isolated limb perfusion, or radiotherapy to achieve an optimal conservative approach. Molecular genetics of sarcomas and quality of margins are essential to guide diagnosis and therapeutic selection. In case of marginal or incomplete resection, a new enlarged surgical resection should always be discussed before administration of any adjuvant treatments. Many retrospective studies and two randomized studies (one of adjuvant brachytherapy and one of external beam radiotherapy) have shown that adjuvant radiotherapy after complete surgery significantly reduces the risk of local recurrence in extremity soft tissue sarcomas. A randomized study has compared pre- to postoperative radiotherapy. The results in terms of local control are similar in both arms. The risk of surgical complications is higher in the preoperative arm and the risk of late sequelae is higher in the postoperative arm. A randomized study within the French sarcoma group is ongoing evaluating the omission of postoperative radiotherapy in favourable cases. Presently, the role of systematic first-line invasive treatment (including surgery and/or radiotherapy) of desmoids is debated. It is becoming evident that up to 50% of patients with desmoids benefit from a front-line non-aggressive policy, because growth arrest is a common feature of this disease. Additional study of the molecular determinants of desmoid behaviour is needed to guide treatment."
"Endometriosis is a relatively common disease in women, usually of reproductive age. In rare occasions, endometriosis may occur in unusual body sites, including extragonadal, extra-pelvic sites, or in the skin. We report a case of endometriosis of the abdominal wall diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). The patient was a 41-year-old woman with a clinical impression of ""desmoid"" tumor of the abdominal wall. FNAB showed groups of epithelial cells with mild nuclear atypia and rare mitoses. A few small clusters of slightly atypical spindle cells were also seen. The initial screening impression was adenocarcinoma due to the atypical cytological features. However, after review with the pathologist, the FNAB was signed out as ""endometriosis."" Subsequent local excisional biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of endometriosis. In conclusion, endometriosis may present diagnostic challenges in FNAB and this possibility should be considered in differential diagnosis. A clinical cytopathological correlation is necessary to avoid a misdiagnosed as an adenocarcinoma."
"Desmoid tumors, characterized by aggressive local infiltration of surrounding tissues, are uncommon benign neoplasms with no metastatic potential, that occasionally may attain large size. We report a case of a 37-year-old woman with an abdominal wall desmoid tumor that appeared and grew rapidly during her pregnancy, diagnosed by trucut core biopsy. Complete surgical excision of a 20 x 16 cm in size tumor and immediate reconstruction with mesh was performed in the postpartum period. She had no postoperative complications and no recurrence at 2-year follow-up. Optimal management of large abdominal wall desmoids during pregnancy has to be individualized, with wide surgical excision remaining the treatment of choice."
"Aggressive fibromatoses (AF; desmoid tumors) are rare clonal neoplastic proliferations of connective tissues that can be locally aggressive despite wide surgical resection and/or radiation therapy. The Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration (SARC) initiated a prospective phase II trial to investigate the outcome of patients treated with imatinib, a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with AF, or 1 of 10 sarcoma subtypes. Here, we report specifically on the outcome of patients with AF as well as evaluations undertaken to examine the mechanism of imatinib. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients >/=10 years old with desmoid tumors that were not curable by surgical management or in whom curative surgery would lead to undesirable functional impairment were eligible. Imatinib was prescribed at 300 mg twice daily [body surface area (BSA) >/= 1.5 m(2)], 200 mg twice daily (BSA = 1.0-1.49 m(2)), or 100 mg twice daily (BSA < 1.0 m(2)). Response outcomes at 2 and 4 months were assessed. Tissue specimens were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for expression of cKIT, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha), PDGFRbeta, AKT, PTEN, FKHR, and beta-catenin. Tumor DNA was analyzed for PDGFRalpha exon 18 and APC mutations by allelic discrimination PCR. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were enrolled. The median number of prior regimens was 1. Kaplan-Meier estimates of 2- and 4-month progression-free survival rates were 94% and 88%, respectively, and 1-year progression-free survival was 66%. Objective response rate was 6% (3 of 51). Expression and polymorphisms of target proteins were identified in tissue samples, but no significant correlation with outcome was observed using the samples available. CONCLUSION: Imatinib may have a role in the management of unresectable or difficult to resect desmoid tumors."
"Desmoid tumor is a rare, benign fibroblastic tumor that is characterized by highly aggressive local invasiveness. The authors report the case of a 35-year-old male who presented with a 20 cm para-umbilical tumor invading the right rectus abdominis muscle. This required a wide excision of the abdominal wall. The resulting defect was closed with a single-stage latissimus dorsi myocutaneous free flap in combination with a prosthetic mesh reconstruction. The authors discuss the therapeutic options for management of these rare tumors and the variety of available techniques for coverage and reconstruction after extensive parietal loss of substance."
"Intra-abdominal desmoid tumor is rare and seldom reported in the literature. It can grow large before causing symptoms, such as obstructing bowel loops or urinary system. Here, we present a 29-year-old male who suffered from intra-abdominal desmoid tumor, and describe its imaging findings on ultrasound and abdominal computed tomography. This tumor usually presents as a large homogeneous hypodense solid mass on computed tomography, and demonstrates mild enhancement after contrast medium administration. Although rare, it should be included in the differential diagnosis when a patient presents with a large abdominal mass."
"Our case concerns a 52-year-old male with FAP, who was treated surgically by restorative colectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis. Three years later, he presented with acute epigastric pain and obstructive ileum. While a mass in the left lateral abdominal region was palpated. The patient underwent laparotomy, some adhesions were dissected and biopsies were taken from the mass. Pathological examination revealed a desmoid tumor of the mesentery."
?
"Mesenteric fibromatosis is a rare benign disease characterized by proliferating fibrous tissue in the bowel mesentery. We report a case of aggressive mesenteric fibromatosis with ureteral stenosis arising in a 46-year-old woman who suffered from intermittent right abdominal pain. Computed tomography revealed a right retroperitoneal mass with right ureteral stenosis at the level of the right common iliac vessel. The mass was excised with resection of the affected segment of the ileum, ascending colon, and ureter, and end-to-end ureter anastomosis was performed. Pathological examination confirmed mesenteric fibromatosis."
"Imatinib induces responses and disease stabilisations in non-resectable patients with aggressive fibromatosis (AF). The precise target of imatinib in AF and predictive factors for response to treatment are unknown. METHODS: We investigated factors potentially predictive of response to imatinib in a series of 40 patients with progressive AF included in a phase II trial of imatinib: we tested the presence of KIT exon 10 variant (M541L), the expression of imatinib-sensitive kinases and cell cycle proteins by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and other clinical and biological factors. RESULTS: Of 10 patients for whom DNA could be extracted, 3 had a KIT exon 10 variant (30%), with no correlation with response or progression-free survival (PFS). The expression of other imatinib targets (PDGFRA/B, macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR)) and of downstream components of the cell cycle, cell proliferation and proliferation pathway (cyclin D1, ERK, MEK 1-2) did not correlate with PFS. Pre-treatment lymphopenia (<1500/microl) and tumour size >120 mm correlated with shorter PFS in univariate and multivariate analyses. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that a baseline biological characteristic of the patient is the major parameter influencing response to imatinib in aggressive fibromatosis. Tumour characteristics, including the presence of a KIT exon 10 M541L variant, may influence tumour control but this needs to be confirmed and better explained."

"Imatinib evaluated as a new treatment option in patients with recurrent or established progressive aggressive fibromatosis/desmoid tumor (AF/DT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients with unresectable and progressive symptomatic AF/DT were treated with imatinib (400 mg/day for 1 year) in a Simon's optimal two-stage phase II study (P(0) = 10%, P(1) = 30%, alpha = 5%, beta = 10%). The primary end point was non-progressive at 3 months (RECIST). RESULTS: The study population consisted of 28 women and 12 men, with a mean age of 41 (range 20-72 years). Most of the primary sites were extra-abdominal (24, 54.5%). Familial adenomatous polyposis was observed in six (15%) cases. The median follow-up was 34 months. Imatinib toxicity was similar to that previously reported in literature. Tumor assessment was validated by a central independent radiology committee for 35 patients At 3 months, one (3%) complete and three (9%) partial confirmed responses were observed. The non-progression rates at 3, 6 and 12 months were, respectively, 91%, 80% and 67%. The 2-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 55% and 95%, respectively. Two patients with mesenteric AF/DT died from progressive disease. CONCLUSION: Imatinib is active in the treatment of recurrent and progressive AF/DT, providing objective response and long-term stable disease in a large proportion of patients."
"To identify high-risk patients with desmoid tumors who could benefit from postoperative radiotherapy (RT) and to determine the efficacy of postoperative and definitive RT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of clinical data for all patients with desmoid tumors who underwent definitive local therapy at the University of Michigan from 1984 through 2008. Estimates for local control were calculated using the product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier, and associations with patient, tumor, and RT characteristics were explored using Cox proportional hazard regression. RESULTS: Treatment for 95 patients who qualified for the study included surgery, RT, or both in 54, 13, and 28 cases, respectively. With a median follow-up of 38 months, the actuarial 3-year local control (95% confidence interval [CI]) was not significantly different (p = 0.3) among the three treatment groups: 84.6% (70.2-92.4), 92.3% (56.6-98.9), and 69.0% (43.1-84.9), respectively. Tumor site in the head/neck (p = 0.03) and history of previous surgical therapy (p = 0.01) were associated with increased recurrence risk (HR = 2.8, 95% CI 1.1-7.4, and HR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.3-7.8), whereas gender, age, use of RT, and positive margins were not (p > 0.2). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest equivalent local control rates after surgery, RT, or a combination of both. Although history of previous surgical therapy or site of origin in the head/neck region were found to be associated with increased risk of recurrence after local therapy, there was no clear association between surgical margin status and local control."
"Desmoid tumor of the chest wall are uncommon fibromatous tumors characterized by their local invasion and frequent recurrences. Extra-abdominal sites are mainly the shoulder girdle, the pelvic girdle and distal ends of the lower limbs. The chest wall represents 8-10% of cases and the tumor is exceptionally intrathoracic. We present here a rare case of a large desmoid tumor of left antero-lateral chest wall. In the presented case, wide excision of the tumor and chest wall reconstruction was done. There was no recurrence in 3 years of follow up."
"We report the case of a patient who developed a desmoid tumor following total proctocolectomy and J-pouch reconstruction that was unresponsive to any medical treatment. Based on estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and progesterone receptor (PR) evaluation (ERalpha-negative, but PR-positive), treatment with mifepristone, a pure antiprogesterone drug, was initiated, and partial tumor regression was achieved."
"Although fibromatosis is considered as benign tumor, it can have significant morbidity, particularly when it occurs in the head and neck. Their propensity for infiltrative local growth with encroachment on vital structures and their tendency to recur make fibromatoses of the head and neck extremely challenging lesions. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 10-year-old boy with desmoid fibromatosis of the upper lip. For this patient, the medical treatment has been decided to avoid a mutilating surgery. He had a good result with chemotherapy using methotrexate and vinblastine. DISCUSSION: According to the literature, surgery is the most common treatment of fibromatosis in the head and neck region. However, particularly in children, alternative modes of therapy must be considered because of the high recurrence rate and to avoid mutilating operations. Chemotherapy using methotrexate and vinblastine may be a reasonable choice."
"We used (18)F-FDG PET to evaluate the FDG uptake in patients with aggressive fibromatosis (AF, also known as desmoid tumours) undergoing therapy with imatinib (imatinib mesylate, Glivec). METHODS: The pilot study included nine patients with progressive AF receiving oral treatment with imatinib at a daily dose of 800 mg. Patients were examined using PET prior to the start of therapy and during imatinib treatment. Restaging according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) was performed in parallel using CT and/or MRI and served as reference. RESULTS: The clinical outcomes in nine evaluable patients were as follows: seven patients with stable disease, and two patients with progressive disease. A 27% decrease in the median average standardized uptake value (SUV) of the sequential PET examinations was demonstrated in all evaluable patients with three patients (33%) showing a decrease in SUV of more than 40% (48%, 52% and 54%, respectively); no patient showed a substantial increase in SUV. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first series of AF patients undergoing treatment with imatinib and monitored using sequential PET imaging, that allows detection of SUV changes after imatinib induction, thus helping to decide whether treatment should be continued or not."
"with the development of investigations, more micro-GIST are discovered, rising the question of wait and see policy for some of them. In locally advanced inoperable patients and metastatic patients, imatinib is the standard treatment. Secondary excision of residual disease has been shown to be related to a good prognosis in responding patients to imatinib, but it is still not demonstrated whether this is due to surgery itself or to a selection bias. An ongoing phase III EORTC randomises this secondary surgery after 6 to 12 months of imatinib in responding patients."
"Desmoid tumours (DT) are myofibroblastic proliferations occurring in 15% of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Several small series have analysed the incidence of DT and predisposing risk factors. Using meta-analytical techniques, this study aimed to identify risk factors for DT development in patients with FAP. METHOD: Studies of sporadic DT were excluded. The study end-points were the incidence of DT in FAP and DT development by gender, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutation, family history of DT and previous abdominal surgery. A random effect Mantel-Haenszel model was used to calculate odds ratios for each risk factor and age group. RESULTS: Ten studies of 4625 patients with FAP fulfilled our inclusion criteria. A total of 559 (12%) patients developed DT. Cumulative analysis demonstrated that 80% of DT developed by age 40, the peak incidence rate being in the second and third decades. A positive family history of DT was the most significant risk factor (OR 7.02, 95% CI 4.15-11.9, P < 0.001). An APC mutation 3' to codon 1399 (OR 4.37, 95% CI 2.14-8.91, P < 0.001) and previous abdominal surgery (OR 3.35, 95% CI 1.33-8.41, P = 0.01) were also implicated. Women were more likely to develop DT (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.13-2.18, P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: There is consistency amongst polyposis registries in documenting the incidence and risk factors for DT development. Having a positive family history for DT is of greater significance than a 3' mutation, suggesting the existence of modifier genes, independent of the APC genotype-phenotype correlation. Few of these risk factors are modifiable. Delaying prophylactic surgery could be appropriate in female patients with a 3' APC mutation and attenuated polyposis."

"Small intestinal neoplasms are uncommon cancers. Benign small intestinal tumors (e.g., leiomyoma, lipoma, hamartoma, or desmoid tumor) usually are asymptomatic but may present with complications. Primary malignancies of the small intestine, including adenocarcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, carcinoid, and lymphoma, are often symptomatic and may present with intestinal obstruction, jaundice, bleeding, or pain. Metastatic neoplasms may involve the small intestine via contiguous spread, peritoneal metastases or hematogenous metastases. Because the small intestine is relatively inaccessible to routine endoscopy, diagnosis of small intestinal neoplasms is often delayed for months after onset of symptoms. During last years the increase of small bowel endoscopy and other diagnostic tools allow earlier non-operative diagnosis. Even though radical resection of small bowel cancer plays an important role, the 5 yr overall survival remains low."
"Familial adenomatous polyposis is an inherited disorder characterized by the presence of multiple colorectal adenomas (more than 100 in the classic form and between 10 and 100 in the attenuated one), with a high risk of colorectal cancer development. To improve the diagnostic and therapeutic management of these patients, the Spanish Registry of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis was created in 2007.We aimed to evaluate the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis in Spain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients included in the Registry during one year were evaluated with respect to their demographic, clinical, pathological, and genetic characteristics. RESULTS: 243 patients of 156 unrelated families from 15 Spanish centers were included. One hundred thirty patients were male, and the mean age at diagnosis was 40 years. According to the clinical presentation, 127 corresponded to the classic form and 116 to the attenuated one. Colorectal adenoma with high-grade dysplasia was identified in 67 (28%) patients, and colorectal cancer in 42 (17%). Extracolonic manifestations were: duodenal involvement (n=46), gastric involvement (n=44), desmoid tumors (n=24), thyroid cancer (n=8), osteomas (n=6) and brain tumor (n=1). APC and/or MYH gene testing was performed in 140 (90%) families, detecting the causative mutation in 75 (54%) of them (70 in the APC gene and 5 in the MYH gene). CONCLUSIONS: During its first year of operability, a large number of patients and families were included in the Registry. The reduced prevalence of colorectal cancer as well as the large proportion of families submitted to gene testing demonstrated a high-quality clinical practice in Spain."
"Mesenteric fibromatosis is a locally aggressive tumor of the mesentery with a high propensity for bowel involvement. Mesenteric fibromatosis often mimics gastrointestinal stromal tumors in size, location and immunohistochemical features. We report the case of a 30-year-old male who underwent resection of a mesenteric tumor, initially diagnosed as gastrointestinal stromal tumor. The tumor was categorized as high-risk and the patient was treated with chemotherapy. Two years later the patient was found to have a mass in the mesentery and restarted on chemotherapy. The tumor did not respond to medical management. The patient underwent a second en bloc resection and pathology results were conclusive for mesenteric fibromatosis. This case highlights the significance of accurately differentiating mesenteric fibromatosis from gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Making a concrete diagnosis is often difficult because both gastrointestinal stromal tumors and mesenteric fibromatosis share a number of morphological and immunohistochemical features including CKIT expression."
"Congenital rhabdomyosarcoma of the tongue is exceedingly rare. Fibromatosis of the tongue is also rare, and very difficult to distinguish from the spindle cell variant of rhabdomyosarcoma. Both appear histologically as spindle neoplasms replacing normal striated musculature of the tongue. The treatment protocol for the former has been developed by the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Studies (IRS) I-IV and requires surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. For fibromatosis, complete surgical excision is usually adequate without additional therapy, although some cases of aggressive fibromatosis also require chemotherapy. With significant differences in appropriate treatment and prognosis, each entity must not be mistaken for the other. We review the differences in radiologic, histologic, and immunohistochemical (IHC) features of both entities."
"The dedifferentiated component of dedifferentiated liposarcoma shows wide histologic variation including tumors with heterologous differentiation. Myofibroblastic differentiation has been recognized in dedifferentiated liposarcoma. However, tumors closely resembling inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor have not. We report the clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular finding in 6 cases of dedifferentiated liposarcoma with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor-like features treated at our institution. The tumors occurred mostly in middle age or elderly men, involved mostly the inguinal/scrotal region or retroperitoneum, and behaved aggressively. Microscopically, the dedifferentiated component closely resembled or, if taken out of context, was indistinguishable from inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. All 3 major patterns seen in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (myxoid, cellular, and hypocellular fibrous) were represented. Areas resembling nodular fasciitis or desmoid fibromatosis were frequent findings. One tumor had heterologous osseous differentiation. In 4 tumors the inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor-like areas were diffuse, whereas in 2 they were combined with noninflammatory myofibroblastic tumor-like high-grade sarcoma. Five tumors stained for smooth muscle actin or desmin, none stained for ALK-1, 5 stained for MDM2, and 5 had amplified MDM2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Well-differentiated liposarcomatous components were present in every tumor. All patients developed locally recurrent or metastatic disease. At last follow-up 2 patients had died of disease and 2 were alive with disease. Dedifferentiated liposarcoma can have prominent inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor-like features, a finding that further expands its histologic spectrum. Awareness of this finding can prevent one from misdiagnosing dedifferentiated liposarcoma as inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, a much less aggressive neoplasm."
"Desmoid tumour resection is a known, albeit rare, cause for chest wall reconstruction. Traditionally, musculocutaneous flaps and synthetic mesh materials have been employed for coverage over these potentially large thoracic defects. More recently, biologic mesh materials have become increasingly more prevalent in a multitude of surgical reconstructions. To date, the current literature describes the usage of select biologic materials, such as human cadaveric acellular dermal matrix, in chest wall reconstruction. One variation of the biologic materials, Permacol((R)), has not been well described in the literature for chest wall reconstruction. Permacol((R)) is a porcine lyophilised acellular dermal collagen. We report the successful use of Permacol((R)) in a complex chest wall reconstruction following the resection of a large desmoid tumour."
"Desmoid tumours (DT) are myofibroblastic proliferations found in 10-25% of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients, either intra-abdominally (IA), in the abdominal wall (AW) or elsewhere (extra-abdominal (EA)). Most DT occur following prophylactic colectomy but occasionally patients present with pre-operative DT. Mutations 3' to codon 1444, predispose to DT and attenuated phenotype, leading to a potential strategy of delaying surgery in patients at high risk of DT. Here we assess if the existence of a pre-operative AW-DT or EA-DT predisposes to IA-DT following laparotomy. Data were collected on FAP patients undergoing primary surgery at St Mark's Hospital. Patients were stratified into those having no DT, EA-DT or AW-DT pre-operatively. Relative-risks were calculated and proportions compared using Fisher's exact-test. 587 FAP patients were identified; nine discovered with IA-DT intra-operatively were excluded. 5(0.9%) and 6(1%) of the remainder had a pre-operative EA-DT and AW-DT, respectively; one (0.2%) had both. Six of these 12 developed a post-operative IA-DT. 566(98%) had no pre-operative DT, 50(9%) of these developed IA-DT post-operatively; median time to tumour was 2 (IQR, 1-3.5) years. A pre-operative AW-DT predisposed to IA-DT post-operatively (RR = 7.6, 95% CI 4.0-14.1, P = 0.0009) whilst EA-DT did not (RR = 2.3, 0.4-13.3, P = 0.38). A 3' mutation was significantly associated with post-operative IA-DT in the 'no pre-operative DT' group (P = 0.002). The presence of a DT external to the abdominal cavity pre-operatively, poses a clinical challenge with regards to surgical decision-making. Patients with an AW-DT pre-operatively may warrant a conservative surgical approach, to minimize post-operative IA-DT risk."
"We report two cases of scapula-thoracic dyskinesia with different etiologies where both patients complained of functional limitation and pain in the shoulder. The first case was caused by a road accident, the second by sequelae of surgery to remove aggressive scapula-axillary fibromatosis. In both patients, therapy with botulin toxin type A (Botox) was performed, which determined a reduction in pain. In the first case, there was also an improvement in function. There were no side effects in the two patients after the injections."
"Fibromatosis is an aggressive fibrous tumor of unknown etiology that is, in some cases, lethal. Until now, there has been no particular classification for the head and neck. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to review the current literature in order to propose a new classification for future studies. METHODS: An evidence-based literature review was conducted from the last 40 years regarding aggressive fibromatosis in the head and neck. Studies that summarized patients' data without including individual data were excluded. RESULTS: Between 1968 and 2008, 179 cases with aggressive fibromatosis of the head and neck were published. The male to female ratio was 91 to 82 with a mean age of 16.87 years, and 57.32% of the described cases that involved the head and neck were found in patients under 11 years. The most common localization was the mandible, followed by the neck. All together, 143 patients were followed up, and in 43 (30.07%), a recurrence was seen. CONCLUSION: No clear prognostic factors for recurrence (age, sex, or localization) were observed. A new classification with regard to hormone receptors and bone involvement could improve the understanding of risk factors and thereby assist in future studies."
"An atypical and rare case report is presented here of a 16 years old female patient who presented with severe, unilateral, gingival enlargement along with aggressive periodontitis around first molars that was confined to the left side of her mouth. A careful recording of the case history and results of clinical examination, laboratory blood analysis, radiological findings, and microbiological and histopathological investigations were noted and a critical review of similar conditions was taken into account to arrive at the said diagnosis."

"The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the incidence of and surgical strategies used for treating orbital tumours in children and adolescents. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was carried out for 22 patients between the ages of 2 weeks and 18 years who were treated in the years 1997-2007 for suspected space-occupying orbital lesions. The specific investigation methods, therapy, and treatment results were described. RESULTS: The most frequent orbital lesions in the children in this study were mesenchymal tumours; the second most common were dermoids. Nineteen patients were surgically treated. Three children with malignant tumours underwent radiochemotherapy after surgery, and two died in the first year after diagnosis. Two other children with benign tumours suffered recurrence of their disease. CONCLUSION: The variety of orbital diseases in paediatric patients includes benign and malignant tumours as well as nonneoplastic lesions. The treatment of orbital disease is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for the attending physician."
"To detect the expression of beta-catenin and Estrogen Receptor in desmoid-type fibromatosis. METHODS: Nuclear beta-catenin expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in 77 lesions with desmoid-type fibromatosis and 171 other spindle cell lesions, including superficial fibromatosis (n = 18), nodular fasciitis (n = 36), keloid (n = 16), scar (n = 10), granulation tissue (n = 9), synovial sarcoma (n = 38), neufibroma (n = 13), solitary fibrous tumor (n =12), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (n = 10), low-grade myxofibrosarcoma (n = 3), low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (n = 3), and smooth muscle tumor (n = 10). In addition, the immunohistochemical expressions of ER-alpha, ER-beta and Ki-67 were examined in all of the lesions with desmoid-type fibromatosis. The nuclear immunohistochemical staining for nuclear beta-catenin and ER-beta was graded as high level ( > or = 25% of cells), low level (5%-25%) or none. RESULTS: High-level nuclear beta-catenin staining was detected in a very limited subset of tissue types, which included 70.1% of lesions with desmoid-type fibromatosis (54/77) and 6.3% of lesions with keloid (1/16). No high-level nuclear beta-catenin staining was seen in any of the other lesions. None of the lesions with desmoid-type fibromatosis expressed ER-alpha. However, 62 (80.5%) of the lesions with desmoids-type fibromatosis were positive in ER-beta, which included 52 (67.5%) with high-level expression, and 10 (13%) with low-level expression. The Spearman correlation analysis suggested that the expression of beta-catenin was positively correlated (r = 0.867, P < 0.05) with the expression of ER-beta. The lesions with desmoid-type fibromatosis had very low Ki-67 positive rate. The recurrence of desmoids-type fibromatosis was not correlated independently with beta-catenin, ER-beta or Ki-67. CONCLUSION: High-level nuclear beta-catenin staining serves as a useful diagnostic tool for desmoid-type fibromatosis. The high expression of ER-beta in desmoid-type fibromatosis provides a biological mechanism for the antiestrogenic compounds to treat fibromatosis. There might exists an interaction between beta-catenin and ER-beta. Beta-catenin, ER-beta or Ki-67 can not predict the prognosis of desmoid-type fibromatosis."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) or desmoid tumor is a rare condition, characterized by deep tissue invasion by a monoclonal fibroblastic neoplasm, developed from musculoaponeurotic structures. Surgery is the treatment of choice, but negative margins can hardly been achieved in large tumors, and can lead to major functional disability. AF medical therapy includes nonsteroids anti-inflammatory drugs, tamoxifen, with inconsistent results. Several reports of imatinib efficacy in AF appear in the literature. Here, we describe for the first time a V530I KIT exon 10 mutant that was associated to a dramatic imatinib response in an extraabdominal aggressive fibromatosis. The previously discovered V530I substitution was characterized in the core binding factor AML, but had never been reported in any other condition, so far. In this paper, we discuss the KIT exon 10 mutations or polymorphisms that have been described in a variety of KIT-related conditions, including acute myelogenous leukemia, mastocytosis, and aggressive fibromatosis."
"head and neck, extremity and abdominal/trunk; type of resection of the primary tumor (complete resection with adequate margins, marginal resection and resection with inadequate margins); type of treatment (exclusive surgery, surgery followed by radiation therapy and surgery followed by tamoxifen or cyclooxygenase inhibitor). A tissue microarray (TMA) was built and the immunohistochemical reactions were performed against ERalpha, ERbeta, PR, and c-kit. All cases were negative for ERalpha, PR and c-KIT. 53/59 cases were positive for ERbeta. No significant difference was observed among clinical variables and the ERbeta status. The estimated 5 and 10 year local recurrence free survival (LRFS) for the patients with complete or marginal resection was 75% and 75%, respectively. Tumor location (p = 0.006) and type of resection (p = 0.001) were predictive of local relapse in the univariate analysis. All patients treated with post-operative tamoxifen were LRFS (p = 0.035). Head and neck and extremities lesions showed higher recurrence rates compared to abdominal/trunk lesions. Marginal resection was associated with local recurrence. In conclusion, although this is a retrospective study, the results presented can contribute to better understanding of the mechanisms under desmoid tumor development and can propose tamoxifen as a therapeutic option to be tested in prospective trials."
"The desmoid tumour is a monoclonal neoplasm originating from musculoaponeurotic tissues. It is benign in histological presentations and yet its locally invasive behaviour could lead to dire consequences such as disfigurement, functional impairment or even mortality. Surgical resection, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and even a wait-and-see policy, either alone or in combination, were advocated as treatment modalities. We experienced an extremely difficult case who had a huge nuchal desmoid tumour measuring 45x35x20 cm in dimension with extension to the anterior neck and thoracic paraspinal area. Its intimacy with the carotid artery, jugular vein and brachial plexus made margin-free resection infeasible. Moreover, the tumour burden was so immense that the patient was plunged into profound hypoproteinaemic, septic and anaemic status, with severe pain, bleeding and odour that mandated prompt and daring management. METHODS: In an effort to prevent uncontrollable tumour bleeding, we embarked on a series of strategic measures, including pre-surgical embolisation, innovative tourniquet technique, a novel method of ligature deployment, staged tumour excision and adjunct methods, such as ethanol injection and irradiation therapy. RESULTS: The huge nuchal desmoid tumour was successfully excised under the planned strategies. The patient went through a number of complications such as sepsis, acute respiratory distress and renal failure. Fortunately, she eventually survived and exhibited no evidences of tumour relapse at 2 years' follow-up. She has resumed daily activity independently without noticeable functional deficit. CONCLUSION: We believe that multimodality strategies and innovative surgical techniques are the key to success in managing such a difficult case."
"Desmoid tumors (DTs) are neoplasms of fibroblastic origin characterized by lack of a capsule. They are nonmetastatic and locally aggressive. Intraabdominal DTs are often observed in familial adenomatous polyposis and Gardner syndrome or subsequent to localized traumatic injury. Sporadic forms are defined as nontrauma- or nongenetic-related DTs. Isolated, sporadic pancreatic DTs have been considered anecdotal, with only 9 cases described in the literature. We report the case of a 68-year-old man with a case of sporadic cystic DT localized to the pancreatic tail. The tumor was discovered incidentally during computerized tomography performed for an unrelated condition. The patient was asymptomatic; however, biopsy was performed on the clinical suspicion of cystic cancer of the pancreas. Pathology analysis showed fibroblastic proliferation, and the diagnosis of DT was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining for beta-catenin. The patient underwent resection with no further treatment and remain disease-free 60 months after surgery."
"Desmoid tumors are fibroblastic/myofibroblastic proliferations. Previous studies reported that CTNNB1 mutations were detected in 84% and that mutations of the APC gene were found in several cases of sporadic desmoid tumors lacking CTNNB1 mutations. Forty tumors were analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Karyotype and fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed a nonrandom occurrence of trisomy 8 associated with an increased risk of recurrence. We report the first molecular characterization including a large series of patients. We performed array CGH on frozen samples of 194 tumors, and we screened for APC mutations in patients without CNNTB1 mutation. A high frequency of genomically normal tumors was observed. Four relevant and recurrent alterations (loss of 6q, loss of 5q, gain of 20q, and gain of Chromosome 8) were found in 40 out of 46 tumors with chromosomal changes. Gain of Chromosomes 8 and 20 was not associated with an increased risk of recurrence. Cases with loss of 5q had a minimal common region in 5q22.5 including the APC locus. Alterations of APC, including loss of the entire locus, and CTNNB1 mutation could explain the tumorigenesis in 89% of sporadic desmoids tumors and desmoids tumors occurring in the context of Gardner's syndrome. A better understanding of the pathogenetic pathways in the initiation and progression of desmoid tumors requires studies of 8q and 20q gains, as well as of 6q and 5q losses, and study of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway."
"In the current study, the authors examined the outcomes of patients with desmoid tumors who received systemic therapy at a single institution to provide a basis for the examination of newer agents. METHODS: Records of patients with desmoid tumors who were treated with chemotherapy at the study institution were reviewed. The activity of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was not addressed. Patients without measurable disease and those receiving therapy could not be documented, and those receiving prophylactic therapy were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 68 patients received 157 lines of therapy. At the time of last follow-up, 9 patients had died, 7 of progressive disease. The cohort was 62% female, with a median age of 32.5 years. Approximately 32% of the patients had Gardner syndrome. The median follow-up was 63 months, and patients received a median of 2 lines of therapy. An intra-abdominal primary tumor location was the most common (44%). The greatest Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response rate was observed with anthracyclines and hormonal therapy and the lowest response was noted with single-agent dacarbazine/temozolomide or tyrosine kinase inhibitors, principally imatinib. On multivariate analysis, macroscopic nodular morphology and the presence of Gardner syndrome were the only tumor factors found to be associated with a greater time to disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other agents, antiestrogens and anthracycline-containing regimens appear to be associated with a higher radiological response rate against desmoid tumors. Systemic therapy can be successful in patients with desmoid tumors, and is a viable option in lieu of morbid or disabling surgery."
A desmoid tumor is a fibroblastic proliferation arising in musculoaponeurotic structures. The pathogenesis is still not clear. A 79-year-old woman who developed a desmoid tumor in the left lower abdomen after surgical resection of an abdominal lipoma seven years previously is presented. Preoperative computed tomography showed a large left lower abdominal mass. Pathology showed the spindle fibroblastic cell pattern typical of desmoids.
"Intra-abdominal desmoid disease is the second leading cause of death in familial adenomatous polyposis patients. The aim of this study was to identify the incidence, management, and outcomes for familial adenomatous polyposis associated intra-abdominal desmoids causing ureteric obstruction. METHODS: Clinical data were abstracted from an institutional review board-approved, prospectively maintained familial polyposis registry. RESULTS: Of 107 patients identified with familial adenomatous polyposis related desmoid disease, 30 (28%) had documented CT scan evidence of ureteric obstruction. There was a 1:2.3 female predominance. Preceding surgery was the most prominent risk factor for development of desmoid disease (28 of 30 patients); 2 patients were diagnosed with desmoids before abdominal surgery. Overall, 11 patients had ureteric obstruction at the time of diagnosis. In the other 19 patients, median time from desmoid diagnosis to ureteric obstruction was 2 years. Pharmacologic management alone was effective in 8 patients. Eighteen patients (60%) underwent retrograde ureteric stent insertion. Five patients (17%) required percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. Three patients (10%) underwent autotransplant of 4 kidneys, and 4 patients (13%) required nephrectomy. One patient underwent ureterolysis, and another underwent ureteric resection with reimplantation. One-third of patients required more than one urologic procedure, and 63% had extensive small-bowel involvement with desmoid. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis associated desmoid disease who develop hydronephrosis require stenting. Complete obstruction may necessitate a nephrostomy. Renal autotransplant is an option for persistent symptomatic obstruction. Physicians treating patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and desmoid disease must be aware of the potential for development of ureteric obstruction and available treatment options."
"Aggressive fibromatosis or desmoid tumor, is a histologically benign entity with unknown etiology that may present a serious clinical course. Due to its high tendency to recur and local aggressive behavior and as there is no established effective medical treatment, complete surgical excision remains the sole management. To our knowledge, we describe the first case of giant desmoid tumor which arised from ileal neobladder mesenterium in a bladder cancer patient with orthotopic substitution."
"Desmoids tumors are rare. They often develop from the fascia and muscles of the abdominal wall. They are considered as benign, but endowed with local aggressiveness. Treatment is primarily surgical. Complete resection with large safety margins and sometimes complex reconstruction is necessary to reduce the risk of local reccurrence. WE report three cases of histology proven desmoids tumors of the abdominal wall treated between 2000 and 2007. Etiologic factors, diagnosis, surgical management and adjuvant therapy in case of incomplete resection or reccurrence are discussed."
"Desmoid tumours are rare, poorly circumscribed tumours that have a firm consistency and, although benign, have a remarkable tendency to infiltrate into surrounding structures. Extra-abdominal desmoid tumours involve mainly the extremities or the chest wall and are usually managed by wide radical resection. Moreover, desmoid tumours involving the chest wall are locally aggressive tumours with a high recurrence rate. We report a case of a pathologically proven desmoid tumour of the chest wall in a patient with a history of bilateral breast cancer and oesophageal cancer. We discuss the imaging appearances of this tumour on positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) and magnetic resonance imaging."
"Fibromatosis of the breast results in aggressive, infiltrative lesions with a tendency for local recurrence. A case of bilateral fibromatosis of the breast treated with nipple-sparing skin-sparing mastectomy and vertical latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction occurring in 22-year-old woman is described herein."
Desmoid tumor originating from the small intestine is extremely rare. We report a 50-year-old man who presented with the sudden onset of severe abdominal pain. Computerized tomography (CT) demonstrated a huge homogeneous tumor in the lower abdomen that appeared to be in continuity with the distal ileum. The mass adherent to the ileum was resected and proved to be a desmoid tumor. The patient has remained recurrence free on follow-up.
"Gene expression microarrays are the most widely used technique for genome-wide expression profiling. However, microarrays do not perform well on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue (FFPET). Consequently, microarrays cannot be effectively utilized to perform gene expression profiling on the vast majority of archival tumor samples. To address this limitation of gene expression microarrays, we designed a novel procedure (3'-end sequencing for expression quantification (3SEQ)) for gene expression profiling from FFPET using next-generation sequencing. We performed gene expression profiling by 3SEQ and microarray on both frozen tissue and FFPET from two soft tissue tumors (desmoid type fibromatosis (DTF) and solitary fibrous tumor (SFT)) (total n = 23 samples, which were each profiled by at least one of the four platform-tissue preparation combinations). Analysis of 3SEQ data revealed many genes differentially expressed between the tumor types (FDR<0.01) on both the frozen tissue (approximately 9.6K genes) and FFPET (approximately 8.1K genes). Analysis of microarray data from frozen tissue revealed fewer differentially expressed genes (approximately 4.64K), and analysis of microarray data on FFPET revealed very few (69) differentially expressed genes. Functional gene set analysis of 3SEQ data from both frozen tissue and FFPET identified biological pathways known to be important in DTF and SFT pathogenesis and suggested several additional candidate oncogenic pathways in these tumors. These findings demonstrate that 3SEQ is an effective technique for gene expression profiling from archival tumor samples and may facilitate significant advances in translational cancer research."
"sarcoma not otherwise specified (6), high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma (5), and Ewing sarcoma (3) were most common. Seven nonsarcomas included melanoma (3), metastatic squamous carcinoma (2), and malignant lymphoma (2). An FNAB-procured cytopathologic diagnosis is clinically reliable in a high percentage of distal extremity mass lesions."
"Genes that replace or duplicate the function of other genes are considered functionally redundant. In this cDNA microarray study, using an Agilent microarray platform and GeneSifter analysis software, we evaluated (1) the degree of downstream transcriptional redundancy and (2) the level of genetic uniqueness apparent in desmoid tumor cells stimulated in vitro for 3 h or for 24 h with 100 ng/ml of exogenous recombinant human EGF (rhEGF) or with recombinant human transforming growth factor alpha (rhTGFalpha). Our intent was to identify genes costimulated, or genes unique to, desmoid cells stimulated in vitro with rhEGF and rhTGFalpha. This experimental approach demonstrated a 55% transcriptional redundancy in the number of desmoid genes significantly upregulated or downregulated following 3 h of stimulation with rhEGF or with rhTGFalpha, and a 65% transcriptional redundancy following 24 h of growth factor stimulation. Approximately 150 genes costimulated by rhEGF and rhTGFalpha were identified. This study suggests that EGF and TGFalpha retain some level of functional redundancy, possibly resulting from their divergence from a common ancestral gene."
"To determine risk factors for recurrence of desmoid-type fibromatosis (aggressive fibromatosis). METHODS: Forty-six cases of desmoid-type fibromatosis in Taiwanese patients were analysed for an association between tumour recurrence and clinical features, pathology, and the presence of p53 protein and beta-catenin on immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: Six (13%) of 46 patients developed recurrence after surgical resection. The only factor significantly associated with tumour recurrence was positive surgical margin (p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: A positive surgical margin is a risk factor for recurrence of desmoid-type fibromatosis."
"Fibromatosis is a rare, locally aggressive and bening breast tumor that presents problems in the diagnosis and may mimic breast cancer on physical examination, mammography and breast ultrasound. Definitive diagnosis is reached by histologic findings. This case shows the unusual presentation in our patient and management of this unfrecuent desmoid tumor."
"Gardner fibroma represents a rare and recently described soft tissue tumor entity in children and young adults. It consists of haphazardly arranged coarse and hyalinized collagen fibers combined with loosely arranged bland spindle and fibroblastic cells. The case of a 13-year-old male patient with Gardner fibroma and osteoma and multicentric desmoid type fibromatosis in his mother is presented with detection of a (heterozygotic) germline mutation of the APC gene leading to a de novo stop codon (deletion of base pairs 5033-5036). FISH analysis revealed a structural loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the APC gene on chromosomal locus 5q21 in one out of five analysed desmoids of the mother, no LOH of APC gene in the Gardner fibroma. Gardner fibroma in children and young adults may serve as an indicator lesion for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), Gardner syndrome, a familial desmoid type fibromatosis without other manifestations of APC or a new APC gene mutation. For the clinician, this diagnosis should be commented upon accordingly by the surgical pathologist. As the result of a detected APC gene mutation, continuous follow-up for the development of colorectal tumors and desmoid type fibromatosis as well as a familial screening for FAP is recommended."
"Dupuytren's disease is a palmar fascia pathology characterised by flexion contracture of the involved fingers in late stages. It has been described a higher prevalence in northern populations, especially in men in the fifth or sixth decade of life.1 Alcohol consumption, liver disease, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy and some of its treatments, tobacco smokers or hand workers are only a example of the different aetiologies proposed. There are a group of patients presenting with more aggressive clinical manifestation named Dupuytren's diathesis. This subtype could frequently present a positive family history, ectopic fibromatosis and bilateral hand affectation. The authors present a 24-year-old woman referred to the Plastic Surgery Department because severe fingers contracture with an associated aggressive plantar fibromatosis. She referred familial history in her first degree relatives (mother and three of seven brothers and sisters). The first clinical manifestations in her hand began when she was 7 years old."

"Desmoid tumors are rare benign neoplasms of fibroblastic origin, frequently presenting in the abdomen of adult patients. Little is reported about clinical features and outcome of desmoid tumors appearing in infants and children, especially when they are located in the face. METHODS: We report a girl with a desmoid tumor of her cheek, which was present at birth. RESULTS: The tumor was treated by surgical excision, with no additional treatment, other than follow-up. No recurrence of the tumor was witnessed 15 months following surgical excision. SUMMARY: Radical surgical treatment with tumor excision, sometimes accompanied by radiotherapy, is the current standard therapy for infantile desmoid tumors. Pharmacological treatment may be added in selected cases. These modalities may be challenging when desmoid tumors appear in the face because of risks of facial distortion and associated growth problems."

"Desmoid disease occurs in one third of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Patients may be protected by changing surgical strategy. We designed a formula to predict desmoid risk and tested the value of adding genotype to the formula. METHODS: A desmoid risk factor was calculated by summing points awarded for gender (male = 1, female = 3), extracolonic manifestations (nil = 1, one = 2, >one = 3), and family history of desmoids (negative = 1, one relative = 2, more than one relative = 3). Performance of the score with and without genotype (5' 1309 = 1, 1309-1900 = 2, 3' 1900 = 3) was analyzed. RESULTS: There were 839 patients (138 desmoids) without genotype and 154 (30 desmoids) with genotype. The mean desmoid risk factor score of patients without desmoids (no genotype) was 4.7 (+/-1.4 SD) and for patients with desmoid the desmoid risk factor was 6.0 (+/-1.7, P < 0.001). Corresponding data for patients with genotype was 6.1 +/- 1.3 (no desmoids) and 8.4 +/- 1.8 with desmoids (P < 0.001). Of patients without genotype, 648 patients were at low risk and 9.9% had desmoid disease, 178 patients were at medium risk and 34% had desmoids, and 10 patients were at high risk and all had desmoids. Of those with genotype information, 83 patients were at low risk and 5% had desmoids, 52 patients were at medium risk and 21% had desmoids, and 18 patients were at high risk and 83% had desmoids. CONCLUSION: The desmoid risk factor identifies patients with various levels of risk for developing desmoid disease, and can be used to plan surgical strategies designed to minimize desmoid risk."
"Primary neoplasms of the mesentery are very rare. They are usually of mesenchymal origin and include desmoid tumor, lipoma, liposarcoma, and fibrosarcoma. Metastatic carcinomas and lymphoma are more common. We report a rare case of localized mesenteric Castleman's disease, presenting as intestinal obstruction. Clinical and radiological findings were suspicious for lymphoma. Localized mesenteric Castleman's disease, though rare, has to be considered in the differential diagnosis of mesenteric tumors, particularly in the young and in the absence of history for other tumor, an abnormal blood picture, or splenomegaly."
"Smoothelin is a smooth muscle-specific cytoskeletal protein exclusively found in differentiated smooth muscle cells. This contrasts with other smooth muscle proteins (eg, h-caldesmon, alpha-smooth muscle actin, desmin, smooth muscle myosin), which are expressed in proliferative (early) stages of smooth muscle development and occasionally in other cell types (striated muscle, myofibroblasts, myoepithelial cells, pericytes). Smoothelin has been shown to be expressed predominantly in visceral smooth muscle and to a lesser extent in vascular smooth muscle. Smoothelin expression in mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract has not been evaluated earlier. The purpose of this study was to determine whether immunostaining for smoothelin could help distinguish smooth muscle neoplasms from their morphologic mimics, particularly KIT-negative gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), desmin-positive GISTs, and desmoid fibromatosis. A total of 150 mesenchymal neoplasms of the GI tract, abdominal cavity, and retroperitoneum were retrieved from consult and surgical pathology archives, including 54 GISTs (8 KIT-negative; 13 desmin-positive), 17 GI leiomyosarcomas (LMS), 11 GI mural leiomyomas, 13 leiomyomas of the muscularis mucosae, 12 gastric schwannomas, 15 inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, 9 cases of mesenteric desmoid fibromatosis, 10 dedifferentiated liposarcomas, and 9 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Immunostaining for smoothelin was performed on all cases. Cytoplasmic and nuclear staining was recorded. Cytoplasmic expression of smoothelin was present in all 24 (100%) benign smooth muscle tumors (mural leiomyomas and leiomyomas of the muscularis mucosae). In contrast, only 4 (24%) GI LMS showed cytoplasmic staining for smoothelin. None of the GISTs, desmoid tumors, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, schwannomas, dedifferentiated liposarcomas, or malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors showed cytoplasmic reactivity for smoothelin. Interestingly, 7 (41%) GI LMS and 12 (22%) GISTs (all except 2 with an epithelioid component) showed multifocal, exclusively nuclear staining for smoothelin. Nuclear expression of smoothelin was not detected in any of the other tumor types examined. In summary, diffuse cytoplasmic staining for smoothelin is highly sensitive and specific for benign leiomyomas of the GI tract. Aberrant nuclear expression is common in GI LMS and may also be seen in GISTs, especially epithelioid and mixed-type tumors. These findings suggest that the extent and pattern of smoothelin expression may help differentiate between benign and malignant mesenchymal tumors of the GI tract, and may be useful in distinguishing leiomyomas from KIT-negative and/or desmin-positive GISTs."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) is a rare tumor of intermediate malignancy that has a strong potential for local invasiveness and recurrence. To date, there are no general recommendations for the clinical management of pediatric AF. METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed 94 patients aged < or =21 years, including 23 patients who underwent complete surgery (Group I), 42 patients who underwent incomplete surgery with microscopic residual tumor (Group II), and 29 patients who underwent either biopsy or macroscopically incomplete surgery (Group III). RESULTS: The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival rates were 44% and 99%, respectively. Local recurrences developed in 22% of patients in Group I, in 76% of patients in Group II, and in 76% of patients in Group III. Two of 7 patients with abdominal disease died of tumor progression, whereas none of the patients with extra-abdominal AF died of their disease. Systemic treatment was given to 15 patients as first-line treatment and to 34 patients at time the time they developed recurrent disease: The response rate was 47% in the former patients and 50% in the latter patients. Objective responses were observed in 11 of 19 patients who received combined methotrexate plus vinblastine/vinorelbine, in 7 of 15 patients who received alkylating-agent chemotherapy, and in 4 of 11 patients who received other therapies (tamoxifen, sulindac, interferon alfa). CONCLUSIONS: The current analysis suggested that the clinical course of AF in children may resemble that of AF in adults. Local recurrences did not affect the chance of responding to systemic therapy or the survival rate. The completeness of initial resection was the main factor that influenced EFS, whereas disease control after marginal resection was much the same as that achieved after intralesional surgery/biopsy. Good responses to systemic treatments, and particularly to low-dose chemotherapy, were observed as reported previously in adults."
"Hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion (ILP) (2 mg, TNF-alpha and 100mg, melphalan) was performed for an irresectable right thigh desmoid tumor with calf extension in a 49-year-old man. The patient had a history of four resections since the age of 19 years. Local ILP toxicity appeared with extensive edema and common peroneal neurologic impairment including paresis that remained severe 10 months later. One of the most troublesome side effects of perfusion is peripheral nerve damage, which has been reported at a rate of between 1 and 48% of perfused patients. ILP is an effective treatment in recurrence situations or where resection threatens loss of function; it, however, requires administration in specialized centers, progress in standardization and close monitoring to avoid locoregional toxicity, the mechanisms of which merit further investigation. Emergency compartmental pressure measurement may indicate fasciotomy, can be of great interest."

"Sporadic abdominal desmoid tumors are rare and data on these tumors as a distinct disease entity are lacking. Previous abdominal surgery, trauma, pregnancy and estrogen intake are considered risk factors. Although desmoids are benign, invasion and a high recurrence rate are common. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate outcomes of surgery for this rare disease. METHODS: Since 1995, 16 patients with pathologically confirmed desmoid tumor were operated on in our center. All familial adenomatous polyposis patients were excluded. A retrospective analysis of data was performed. RESULTS: Of the 16 patients 12 (75%) were females. Mean age was 40.5 years (range 24-70). Thirteen patients were symptomatic and 3 were incidentally diagnosed. All patients presented with an isolated mass; 7 (50%) originated in the abdominal wall, 6 (37.5%) were retroperitoneal and 3 were (18.8%) mesenteric. All tumors except one were completely excised. Morbidity was low with no mortality. One patient was reoperated due to involved margins. None of the patients had recurrence within a median follow-up of 64 months (range 5-143). CONCLUSIONS: The perception of sporadic abdominal desmoids as tumors with a high recurrence rate (20-70%) is probably incorrect. Adequate surgery with wide margins leads to a very low recurrence rate; cure is a legitimate goal."
"Based on a representative selection of relevant references, the aim of this study was to reflect the change of the algorithm in the surgical management of desmoid tumours (DT) in cases of accompanying familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Main focus is concerned with the basics of differential treatment, including additional considerations on epidemiology, diagnosis, outcome and follow-up. DT are rare benign tumours that do not metastasise but tend to invade locally. In contrast to the general population, DT in patients with FAP are more common, show a different pattern of tumour sites and cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Most DT occur in the abdominal cavity and account for the majority of serious problems. Genetic disposition and hormonal factors as well as prior surgical trauma are considered causative for the development of DT. Characteristic symptoms are abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting but DT may also present as acute abdomen. CT scan determines localisation and extension of the tumour. Treatment includes various strategies of medication, surgical resection and radiation. Data concerning diagnostic and therapeutic procedures are based on studies with small case series or case reports only. Therefore data from international multicentre studies are necessary for improving the prognosis and developing reliable and stringent guidelines."
"Fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors of the head and neck are numerous and may develop either in adults or in childhood. They can be benign and nonrecurring, benign but locally recurring, of low-grade of malignancy or fully malignant. The diagnosis and treatment of these lesions can be difficult. This review focuses on several (myo)fibroblastic lesions of the head and neck, including nodular fasciitis and related neoplasms, hemangiopericytoma-like tumor (glomangiopericytoma) of sinonasal passages, nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, desmoid fibromatosis, Gardner-associated fibroma, extrapleural solitary fibrous tumor, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma, and adult-type fibrosarcoma."
"The desmoid tumors (DTs) are unusual soft-tissue tumors that have a propensity for aggressive local growth and may develop during, or soon after pregnancy. Pregnancy-associated DTs are uncommon and optimal management of this tumor has yet to be defined. Currently, controversy centers on the timing of surgical resection and is influenced by the potential for tumor growth and the effects of a gravid uterus. A review of current literature in which DTs were managed either during pregnancy or in the postpartum period, was carried out. Surgical resection of these tumors has been performed successfully both during and soon after delivery, and the role of postpartum radiotherapy, chemotherapy and other medical intervention remains controversial. Management of DTs diagnosed during pregnancy is complex and treatment must be individualized."
"To report on the clinical presentation and outcome for 234 patients with extra-abdominal desmoids tumors. METHODS: Since 1977, the authors have treated 234 patients with extra-abdominal desmoid tumors. The patients had an average age of 36.7 and 61% were female. The tumors arose adjacent to muscles or bones and the largest number were in the foot, shoulder thigh and calf. All of the patients were treated by primary surgery. Thirty-seven had additional radiation and eight had chemotherapy. RESULTS: Local recurrence occurred in 39 patients and 23% of the patients required additional surgery. Of great concern were 24 patients who developed multiple sites metachronously, which required further surgery and in many cases caused disability. None of the patients died of disease but 5 required amputations. CONCLUSIONS: The authors concluded that despite the benign nature of the disease, these patients are difficult to treat and the results are sometimes considerably less than optimal."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a locally aggressive infiltrative low-grade tumour, although pathologically benign, and it does not metastasise, yet it can cause serious local distressing symptoms by virtue of local destruction and impairment of local function. The aim of this study was to emphasise the role of radiotherapy and adequate surgery in the treatment of fibromatosis in patients presenting with newly diagnosed or recurrent disease and to analyse our treatment results over 15 years for this rare tumour type. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-four patients with confirmed diagnosis of aggressive fibromatosis treated at King Faisal Specialist Hospital between 1990 and 2006 were identified from our local cancer registry. Forty-seven patients had surgery: complete resection (R0) in 20 patients, incomplete surgery (R1/2) in 27 patients, and seven patients had biopsy only. Forty-five patients were treated with radiotherapy: 38 patients were treated with postoperative radiotherapy, three patients were treated with preoperative radiotherapy and four patients had radiotherapy as the only treatment. The radiotherapy dose ranged between 45 and 60Gy (median 50.4Gy). Three patients did not receive any form of treatment apart from biopsy, but were still included in the final analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-two per cent (28/54 patients) of our patient population had tumour recurrence when first presented to King Faisal Specialist Hospital. The median age was 29.5 years (range 2-63 years). The most common site of involvement was the extremities (28 patients). Among the 54 patients (with primary and recurrent presentation) there were 10 local recurrences, all of which were within the original primary site. The 5-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates for the whole group were 75 and 95%, respectively. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the depth of invasion significantly affected progression-free survival. CONCLUSION: Aggressive fibromatosis is effectively treated with surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. Patients first presenting with tumour recurrence may still have local tumour control comparable with newly diagnosed patients."
"We report a case of desmoid tumor of the chest wall in a 79-year-old woman. The patient was referred to our hospital for management of a chest wall mass. Four months previously, the patient noted a small lump in the right lateral chest wall that had rapidly increased in size. Magnetic resonance imaging of the chest revealed a soft tissue tumor in the right lateral chest wall with unclear margins that extended into the intercostal muscles. Positron emission tomography with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) showed slight FDG accumulation at the lesion. Because open biopsy suggested a desmoid tumor, full-thickness chest wall resection with reconstruction was performed. The final diagnosis was desmoid tumor of the chest wall. Wide surgical resection during the initial operation is an essential element in the treatment of this tumor."
"In a prior randomized phase II trial comparing hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion (HILP) with four different doses of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), no dose effect was detected for response, but systemic toxicity was far lower with low-dose TNF-alpha. The objective of the present study was to confirm these data on a larger sample size of locally advanced or recurrent extremity soft tissue sarcomas with low-dose TNF-alpha. METHODS: We assessed a prospective database comprising 100 HILP (38-40 degrees C) with melphalan (10 mg/L) and TNF-alpha (1 mg). The remnant tumor was resected 2 months later. RESULTS: Among 52 recurrences, 18 were in a previously irradiated field. Stages according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer classification were II (19 patients), III (78 patients), and IV (3 patients). The site/size were: 30 patients/57 mm and 70 patients/86 mm for the upper and lower limbs, respectively. Tumor grades (FNCLCC) were 1 (23 patients), 2 (34 patients), and 3 (43 patients). Fifty-one patients had received systemic chemotherapy before HILP. Responses on magnetic resonance imaging were 30% complete, 49% partial, 9% no change, and 12% progression. No mortality or systemic toxicity occurred. Local toxicity (Wieberdink) attained grade 2 (16 patients), 3 (5 patients), and 4 (1 patient). Limbs were able to be saved in 87% patients. Three-year overall survival and the local recurrence rate were 89% and 18%, respectively. Age, sex, tumor size, recurrence, uni- or multifocality, grade, preoperative chemotherapy, and a previously irradiated field were not predictive of response or local toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm that 1 mg of TNF-alpha is as effective as the standard dose and results in no systemic toxicity."
We report the case of a 65-year-old woman with an aggressive fibromatosis of the rectus abdominis muscle suspicious for a metastasis of renal cell carcinoma after tumor nephrectomy 3 years previously. Aggressive fibromatoses (desmoid tumors) are rare semimalignant tumors of the connective tissue with local infiltration and destruction of tissue. Complete resection is essential to avoid tumor relapse. Aggressive fibromatosis must be considered in the differential diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma metastasis. Complete resection and subsequent radiotherapy seem to be the therapy of choice.
"Desmoid tumors are rare, benign fibroblastic tumors that are locally infiltrative and can cause extensive morbidity by destruction of adjacent vital structures. Due to the rarity of these tumors, evidence regarding optimal treatment protocols is drawn from case reports and single-arm series with small patient numbers. We report a case of a patient with a desmoid tumor of the left supraclavicular region that was diagnosed and treated in our department and a review of the current literature."
"Fibroblast activation protein (FAP)/seprase and dipeptidylpeptidase-IV (DPP-IV)/CD26 are serine integral membrane proteases. They are involved in tissue remodelling, cancer invasion and metastases, mechanisms that are controversial. The aim was to identify cell types that express FAP and DPP-IV in human bone and soft tissue tumours, and to determine whether there are any correlations between the expression of FAP and DPP-IV and the malignant potential of tumours. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study analysed in situ expression in 25 malignant and 13 benign human bone and soft tissue tumours. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses confirmed mRNA expression of FAP and DPP-IV in all individuals. Immunohistochemistry using pre-fixed frozen sections revealed that FAP was positive in low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma, the fibroblastic component of osteosarcomas, and malignant fibrous histiocytomas, but negative in Ewing's sarcomas and rhabdomyosarcomas. DPP-IV showed similar immunohistochemical results. Among benign tumours, non-ossifying fibromas, desmoid tumours and chondroblastomas expressed both FAP and DPP-IV. Giant cells expressed DPP-IV in giant cell tumours. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that FAP and DPP-IV are consistently expressed in bone and soft tissue tumour cells that are histogenetically related to activated fibroblasts and/or myofibroblasts, irrespective of their malignancy. DPP-IV is also expressed in monocyte-macrophage lineage cells."
"Desmoid tumors are fibrous neoplasms that are infiltrative and locally aggressive. Although they are histologically benign with negligible metastatic potential, recurrence after surgical resection is common. Pharmacotherapy and radiation treatment have been utilized when surgery has been considered unsuitable. Since April 2003, we have used radiofrequency ablation to treat five desmoid tumors in four patients. Complications were seen in two patients; one patient had cellulitis and another had soft tissue necrosis. Clinical follow-up was available for all four patients and ranged from 4-68 months (mean 30 months). No recurrences were detected."

"The purpose of this paper was to illustrate the role of diagnostic imaging in superficial and deep fibromatosis through a review of the use of different imaging modalities, including radiography, ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), angiography and scintigraphy. In particular, in agreement with published data, it emphasises the crucial role of MRI as the primary modality providing the information needed for management decisions, preoperative planning and follow-up of these lesions."

"Surgical resection, radiation therapy and chemotherapy are all accepted as standard treatments for extra-abdominal desmoid (EAD) tumors, but their effectiveness has been limited by frequent local recurrence. The purpose of this article is to describe our early experiences with using percutaneous cryoablation for local control of extra-abdominal desmoid tumors in five patients whose tumors had failed to respond to standard therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a retrospective search of our institution's radiology database for patients who had undergone percutaneous cryoablation for treatment of EAD tumors between June 2004 and July 2007, we identified five patients (three female and two male). No patients were excluded from this review. Three of these patients had been referred for cryoablation for local tumor control, and two had been referred for palliation of inoperable tumors. The age range of the patients at the time of cryoablation was 9-41 years. The treated EAD tumors were located in the neck, shoulders and trunk and ranged in size from 3.0 cm to 10.0 cm. Medical records were reviewed for short-term and long-term follow-up, and patients were contacted for additional follow-up. Patients were asked to rate their pain as absent, mild, moderate or severe, and to compare it with their levels before cryoablation, describing it as improved, unchanged or worsened. Radiology records were reviewed to follow the size of the EAD tumors before and after cryotherapy. RESULTS: For the three patients referred for local control of EAD tumors, complete tumor coverage with the ablation zones was achieved. Two of these patients, with masses 3.0 cm and 4.9 cm in diameter, reported complete absence of pain at both short-term and long-term follow-up at 13 months and 49 months. Their tumors had completely resolved on long-term imaging follow-up at 19 months and 43 months. The third patient, with a 6.1 cm mass, reported improved mild pain at 6 months, and imaging showed a moderate decrease of tumor size. For the two patients referred for palliative therapy, initial partial pain relief was felt 2 weeks after the procedure, At long-term (58 months) follow-up of one patient with a 9.1 cm mass, the tumor was still present although reduced in size, and local pain had returned to its former moderate level. In the other patient who underwent only partial treatment of a 10.0 cm mass, at long-term follow-up (36 months) the mass had enlarged and pain had returned to the pretreatment, moderate level. CONCLUSION: Cryoablation appears to be an effective alternative treatment for the achievement of local control of small and moderately sized EAD tumors, but it is likely of limited use in patients with larger tumors that have untreatable regions due to involvement of vital structures. Continued research evaluating cryoablation for the treatment of EAD tumors is needed."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) or desmoid tumour is a monoclonal proliferation which is locally invasive but does not metastasize. If local treatment fails to control the disease, systemic treatment with anti-oestrogens, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or chemotherapy can be used. Recent reports indicate that pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) is effective. METHODS: Twelve patients with AF received PLD between February 2006 and May 2009. PLD was administered intravenously (iv) at 50mg/m(2) over 1h every 4 weeks. RESULTS: The female/male ratio was 11:1 and median age at presentation was 29 years (range 3-53). Objective response (PR) was achieved in 4 (36%) of 11 patients. In one case ongoing shrinkage of the tumour was observed for over 12 months and partial remission was achieved at 14 months after the completion of treatment. Seven patients achieved stable disease. One patient is currently undergoing chemotherapy. Clinical benefit in terms of pain relief, improved mobility or cosmesis was observed in 11 patients. Nine patients (75%) had no evidence of progression at the end of this follow-up period and disease control has ranged from 7 to 39 months with a median of 14 months. The most severe toxicities observed were palmar-plantar erythema (4) and mucositis (3). In 6 cases (55%) toxicity resulted in dose reduction. CONCLUSION: This is the largest series of patients with AF receiving PLD reported to date. PLD as a single agent therapy has acceptable toxicity and highly promising activity in unresectable AF and may provide long-term clinical benefit in some patients."
"Functional results after resection-reconstruction operated at the same time. Desmoid tumors, also known as aggressive fibromatosis, are benign locally aggressive tumors with a high rate of recurrence. Most authors recommend surgical treatment with wide-free margin. Achieving margins of normal tissue around an upper extremity lesion without creating significant functional compromise is frequently difficult. Therefore, functional reconstructive surgery is important, considering that for most patients treated for these tumors, the life expectancy is high and considering also that wide resection can affect the function and the aesthetics as well. We present a case of aggressive fibromatosis in the proximal third of the forearm treated by wide resection and reconstructive surgery in one single procedure, with an acceptable functional result with no evidence of recurrence at 3 years of follow-up."
"Fibromatoses are benign tumors that can occur anywhere in the body. They are locally aggressive and tend to recur; they also cause considerable morbidity, particularly when they arise in the head and neck. Fibromatosis in the submandibular region is rare. Here, we present a case of fibromatosis of the submandibular region in a 42-year-old female who presented with a right submandibular mass. The patient underwent complete excision of the fibromatosis, showed negative margins and had no adjuvant therapy. Her recovery was uneventful, and there was no recurrence or neurological deficit 1 year after the operation."
"MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) is characterized by a lifetime risk of colorectal cancer of up to 100%. However, no systematic evaluation of extracolonic manifestations has been reported. METHODS: A large cohort of MAP patients was recruited from a European multicenter study. Data were collected on 276 cases from 181 unrelated families. Information on extracolonic tumor spectrum and incidence were evaluated to determine cumulative lifetime risk, which was compared with that of the general population to obtain standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). RESULTS: Duodenal polyposis occurred in 17% of cases; the relative risk (SIR) of duodenal cancer was 129 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 16-466), whereas the lifetime risk was 4%. The incidence of extraintestinal malignancies among cases was almost twice that of the general population (SIR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.4-2.5), with a lifetime risk of 38%. We observed a significant increase in the incidence of ovarian, bladder, and skin cancers (SIR: 5.7, 7.2, and 2.8, respectively) and a trend of increased risk of breast cancer among cases. The median ages of onset of these 4 malignancies ranged from 51 to 61 years. In contrast to familial adenomatous polyposis, no desmoid tumors were observed, but sebaceous gland tumors, characteristic of the Muir-Torre variant of Lynch syndrome, occurred in 5 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The relative risks for several extraintestinal malignancies increased in patients with MAP, but based on the spectrum of cancers (which overlaps with that of Lynch syndrome) and the relatively advanced age at onset, intensive surveillance measures other than frequent endoscopy are unlikely to be helpful to patients with MAP."
"Desmoid tumors are locally invasive myofibroblastic lesions that arise predominantly in the abdominal wall or shoulder girdle and are prone to aggressive local recurrences without metastases. We hypothesized the intrinsic invasiveness and drug resistance displayed by cells derived from a familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)-associated desmoid tumor would surpass the response shown by cells derived from sporadic desmoid tumors. In vitro cell motility and expression of motility-associated genes were quantified using Boyden Chambers and Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assays, respectively. Doxorubicin resistance was quantified by Trypan Blue dye exclusion. cDNA microarrays identified genes responsive to doxorubicin. FAP-associated tumor cells were significantly more invasive and refractory to doxorubicin than were cells extracted from sporadic tumors. Pro-MMP1 protein predominated over MMP3 in FAP-associated cell culture supernatants, while MMP3 was the dominant antigen in sporadic tumor cell supernatants. Three genes associated with apoptosis were identified by microarray, two prosurvival genes overexpressed in FAP-associated cell cultures (NTN1, TNFRSF10C) and one proapoptosis gene overexpressed in sporadic tumor cell cultures (FOXL2)."
"The proper classification of spindle cell neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract frequently requires the use of immunohistochemistry, as the histologic appearance of these lesions often overlaps. OBJECTIVE: To review the antibodies used in the diagnosis of spindle cell neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract, and to outline an approach to the evaluation of these lesions by using immunohistochemistry. DATA SOURCES: The authors' experience and a review of the English literature from 1976 to 2008. CONCLUSIONS: The most common spindle cell neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract is gastrointestinal stromal tumor; this lesion is readily diagnosed with c-kit immunohistochemistry in most cases. Other stains, such as smooth muscle actin, desmin, S100 protein, and beta-catenin, are also useful in the diagnosis of smooth muscle tumors, schwannomas, desmoid-type fibromatoses, and metastatic melanoma."
"Previous reports even large studies discussing the prognosis of desmoids have included tumors from intra- and extra-abdominal sites as well as incomplete resection. The purpose of this study was to explore prognostic factors associated with the recurrence free survival (RFS) rate in surgically treated extra-abdominal and abdominal wall desmoids. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 198 consecutive desmoid patients were treated with surgery over a 20-year period at a single institution. Of these, 151 patients with extra-abdominal and abdominal wall tumors were retrospectively reviewed. One hundred thirteen patients were referred for the primary tumor and the other 38 for recurrent disease initially treated elsewhere. All patients underwent a macroscopically complete resection. RESULTS: The median follow-up interval was 102 months. Thirty-one patients (20.5%) had a local recurrence (LR). No patients died of the disease. The 5- and 10-year RFS was 79.7% and 78.5%, respectively. Admission status, gender, tumor size, margin status, location, and number, were predictors of LR in univariate analysis. Tumor size and margin status were independent prognostic factors in multivariate analysis. Positive margins were predictive of recurrence of primary disease, and also showed a trend for recurrent disease, which was not statistically significant. The selective use of adjuvant radiation did not show significant benefit over local control. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of primary or recurrent disease, microscopically negative margins should always be the goal for extra-abdominal desmoids surgery, if no cosmetic defects or function demolition is encountered. Extra-abdominal desmoids deserve more attention and should be treated more aggressively, especially when leaving positive margins."
"This case report describes the radical subtotal palliative resection of a massive recurrent desmoid tumor encompassing the abdomen, pelvis, and groin in a child who was 13 years old at the time of initial resection. Given the extensive distribution of the tumor en bloc resection, which is the standard treatment of desmoid tumors, would have meant performing a hemipelvectomy and repair of a large abdominal wall defect, likely with skin grafts and mesh. The patient's personal goals however were to alleviate the pain and limited mobility that would allow her to re-attend high school and appear normal to her peers. Therefore, palliative surgery was pursued and currently the patient is 5 years out from her last surgery doing well. We believe that the option of surgical palliation in this case was warranted and should be an option for similar cases in the future."
"We evaluated the results of, and the course of treatment with, external fixation (EF) in treating complications associated with bone tumors and related surgery. METHODS: Eighteen patients (9 males, 9 females; mean age 19 years; range 6 to 35 years) who were treated with EF were evaluated in three groups. Histologic diagnoses were osteosarcoma (n=3), Ewing's sarcoma (n=3), hereditary multiple exostosis (n=3), chondrosarcoma (n=2), synovial sarcoma (n=2), Ollier's disease, giant cell tumor of bone, desmoid fibroma, chondromyxoid fibroma, and enchondroma. Complications secondary to bone tumors (n=4) and occurring following limb salvage surgery (n=14) were treated with Ilizarov circular EF in nine patients, unilateral EF in six patients, and both in three patients. RESULTS: The first group included eight patients who were treated with EF for infection and nonunion or deformity following surgery. The mean shortening was 10.6 cm, the mean lengthening was 9.7 cm, and the mean external fixator index was 48.8 days/cm. One patient developed fracture of the free vascularized fibula graft after EF removal, and amputation was required in two patients. The second group consisted of six patients who had shortening secondary to tumor surgery. The mean shortening was 7.5 cm, the mean lengthening was 6.5 cm, and the mean external fixator index was 28 days/cm. In this group, the major complications were implant failure and knee stiffness. The third group included four patients with deformity and shortening secondary to multiple exostosis (n=3) and Ollier's disease. The mean shortening was 7.5 cm, the mean lengthening was 6.5 cm, and the mean external fixator index was 57.2 days/cm. One patient developed ulnar shortening of 2 cm after growth. CONCLUSION: The use of EF in the management of complications associated with bone tumors and related surgery yields successful results especially in young patients."
"Desmoid tumour is relatively rare and generally non-metastatisizing lesion of mesenchymal origin composed of fibrous tissue and fitting in the group of aggressive fibromatosis; it is a locally aggressive proliferative soft-tissue lesion with controversial nature. This tumour accounts for 0.03% of all tumours and 3% of soft-tissue tumours with annual incidence of two to four cases per million. Although desmoid tumours are more common in persons aged 10-40 years than in others, they do occur in young children and older adults; in children the sex incidence is equal. This is a rare case of extra-abdominal desmoid tumour in a 14-year-old girl affected by spastic tetraparesis. To our knowledge no similar cases are present in literature to date."
"Desmoid tumors are rare, benign tumors with locally aggressive behavior which originate from fascial or musculoaponeurotic structure. They are more common in young women than young man. The etiology of desmoid tumors are uncertain but may be related to operation, trauma or hormonal factors. The authors report a 17-year old woman, gravida 1, para 1 with a mass at her lower abdominal wall during the fifth month of gestation. She was biopsied during delivery in another hospital but was not given a definite diagnosis. The mass had grown rapidly after biopsy and delivery. The tumor measured 28 x 21 x 18 centimeters in size and 4,900 g in weight. Complete surgical excision was performed The pathological report was desmoid tumor (aggressive fibromatosis). She had no post-operative complication and no recurrent tumor in the 8 months after operation."
"This article illustrates the imaging findings that have pathologic correlation and the clinical presentation of mammary fibromatosis. CONCLUSION: Mammary fibromatosis is a rare, benign, nonmetastasizing stromal tumor. It presents clinically and radiologically as a palpable, spiculated, and locally invasive tumor that is suspicious for malignancy. MRI is ideal for evaluation of chest wall involvement. Although histologically benign, the tumor is locally aggressive and has significant recurrence rates. On occasion, recurrence may require radical surgery."
"While several modalities have been proposed for the treatment of desmoid tumour/aggressive fibromatosis, high local recurrence rates have been reported. We present a retrospective study of including patients treated with radiation therapy, some of them in combination with surgical resection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four consecutive patients were included (mean age 40+/-16 years, 9 male). Complete follow-up was available in 31 patients (51+/-36 months). Seventeen patients (50%) were treated with radiation therapy alone, 17 patients with radiation therapy and surgery. Radiation therapy (external beam) was applied in most cases to a total dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. The lesion was located in the upper extremity in 11 patients, in the lower extremity in 14 cases and on the trunk in 9 cases. RESULTS: Overall recurrence/progression free survival was 88.5% at 5 years and 77.5% at 10 years. Recurrence free survival of the subset of patients undergoing combined treatment with radiation therapy and surgical resection was 83.6% at 5 years and 10 years. In patients who did not receive surgery but only radiation therapy, MRI showed a complete response in 20%, a partial response in 20%, and stable disease in 53% of cases. In this subset, two-third of patient had a metabolic response to radiotherapy (i.e. decrease uptake on the thallium-210 scan after radiotherapy compared to pre-therapy levels). CONCLUSION: Low recurrence rates can be achieved with the use of radiation therapy alone in selected cases. Patients with a metabolic response (decrease) to radiotherapy may be treated with a non-surgical approach. Surgery might be considered in patients with a poor metabolic response to radiotherapy."

"Nodular fasciitis (NF) typically presents as an enlarging soft tissue mass with imaging characteristics that may be suggestive of soft tissue sarcoma or desmoid tumor. This presentation can make a correct diagnosis and management of patients with NF a challenge. We report our recent experience with two cases of NF that were both referred with a diagnoses of ""soft tissue sarcoma."" Patient 1 was a 46-year-old woman who had undergone breast augmentation and was referred with a rapidly growing firm mass on the left chest wall beneath the breast implant. Computed tomography of the chest noted the mass to be 8 cm x 11 cm in size displacing the implant laterally with no radiological involvement of the bony structures of the chest. Core biopsy was suggestive of inflammation only. Given the clinical suspicion of malignancy, the patient underwent resection of the mass with implant removal. Final pathology showed NF. Patient 2 was a 65-year-old woman referred with an enlarging tender 3-cm infraclavicular mass and a clinical diagnosis of ""soft tissue sarcoma."" Preoperative biopsy suggested NF. The patient underwent complete excision, which confirmed the diagnosis. These cases highlight the clinical issues associated with management of patients with NF. Current approaches to evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of NF are discussed."
"We analyzed our experience with intraoperative electron radiotherapy (IOERT) followed by moderate doses of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) after organ-sparing surgery in patients with primary or recurrent aggressive fibromatosis. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Indication for IOERT and postoperative EBRT as an individual treatment approach to avoid mutilating surgical procedures was seen when complete surgical removal seemed to be unlikely or impossible. A total of 31 lesions in 30 patients were treated by surgery and IOERT with a median dose of 12 Gy. Median age was 31 years (range, 13-59 years). Resection status was close margin in six lesions, microscopically positive in 13, and macroscopically positive in 12. Median tumor size was 9 cm. In all, 25 patients received additional EBRT, with a median dose of 45 Gy (range, 36-54 Gy). RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 32 months (range, 3-139 months), no disease-related deaths occurred. A total of five local recurrences were seen, resulting in actuarial 3-year local control rates of 82% overall and 91% inside the IOERT areas. Trends to improved local control were seen for older age (>31 years) and negative margins, but none of these factors reached significance. Perioperative complications were found in six patients, in particular as wound healing disturbances in five patients and venous thrombosis in one patient. Late toxicity was seen in five patients. CONCLUSION: Introduction of IOERT into a multimodal treatment approach in patients with aggressive fibromatosis is feasible with low toxicity and yielded good local control rates even in patients with microscopical or gross residual disease."
"Desmoid tumors are soft-tissue neoplasms arising from fascial or musculo-aponeurotic structures. Most reported thoracic desmoid tumors originate from the chest wall. However, intrathoracic desmoid tumors are rare. We present a case of a 35-year-old male patient complaining of mild shortness of breath. The patient was diagnosed to have a huge intrathoracic desmoid tumor, which was successfully resected."

"end-binding protein 1 (EB1) and kinesin-family-member 3a (KIF3a), both of which are ciliary proteins involved in intraflagellar transport. Finally, pathogenetic similarities between some ciliopathies and extraintestinal tumours in FAP suggest a cilia defect. Understanding extracolonic manifestations in the context of FAP as a ciliary disorder might add new therapeutic options for patients with Gardner's syndrome."
"Surgery is still the standard treatment for desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF). Recently, the Institut Gustave Roussy (IGR), Villejuif, France, reported a series of patients treated with a front-line conservative approach (no surgery and no radiotherapy). The disease remained stable in more than half of patients. This study was designed to evaluate this approach on the natural history of the disease in a larger series of patients. METHODS: A total of 142 patients presenting to the IGR or Istituto Nazionale Tumori (INT), Milan, Italy, were initially treated using a front-line deliberately conservative policy. Their progression-free survival (PFS) was observed and a multivariate analysis was performed for major clinical variables. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients presented with primary tumor, 68 with recurrence. Eighty-three patients received a ""wait & see"" policy (W&S), whereas 59 were initially offered medical therapy (MT), mainly hormonal therapy and chemotherapy. A family history of sporadic colorectal cancer was present in 8% of patients. The 5-year PFS was 49.9% for the W&S group and 58.6% for the medically treated patients (P = 0.3196). Similar results emerged for primary and recurrent DF. Multivariate analysis identified no clinical variables as independent predictors of PFS. In the event of progression, all patients were subsequently managed safely. CONCLUSIONS: A conservative policy could be a safe approach to primary and recurrent DF, which could avoid unnecessary morbidity from surgery and/or radiation therapy. Half of patients had medium-term stable disease after W&S or MT. A multidisciplinary, stepwise approach should be prospectively tested in DF."
"Desmoid tumors are fibroblastic/myofibroblastic neoplasms, which originate from musculo-aponeurotic structures and are classified as deep fibromatoses. Despite their benign histologic appearance and lack of metastatic potential, desmoid tumors may cause aggres?sive local infiltrations and compression of surrounding structures. They are often associated with female gender, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and sporadically may occur at sites of previous trauma, scars or irradiation. Molecular studies have demonstrated that these patients are associated with a bi-allelic APC mutation in the affected tissue. Radical tumor resection with free margins remains the first therapy of choice. In cases with anatomical or technical limitations for a wide excision, radiation therapy represents a proven and effective alternative or supplementary treatment."
"Implant-associated mesenchymal tumors (IAMT) of the breast are rare, and most are fibromatoses. There has been no systematic analysis of IAMT to determine their full histologic spectrum, whether there is an association with implant type or rupture, and if evidence supports a causal or fortuitous relationship between tumor and implant. We, therefore, analyzed all mesenchymal tumors associated with breast implants from our soft tissue consultation database spanning a period from 1989 to 2005. Information regarding location, type, and integrity of implant and its temporal relationship to tumor was recorded. Eight IAMT were identified exclusively in female patients (ages 28-64 years; median, 38 years), all of whom presented with a palpable mass. Tumors developed after placement of either a silicone (n = 7) or saline (n = 1) implant (median, 2 years; range, 1.8-10 years), which was usually inserted for cosmetic purposes (n = 7). All tumors arose in or around the capsule of a grossly intact implant, and in one case, the tumor was confined exclusively to the implant capsule. In patients with silicone implants, silicone granulomas were identified within the capsule and associated neoplasm despite the integrity of the implant. Six cases were fibromatoses; one was a pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma; and one was a fibrosarcoma. None of the patients with fibromatosis was known to have familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or Gardner syndrome, although one had Poland syndrome (aplasia of the thorax). One patient with a sarcoma had received radiation 10 years previously for breast carcinoma. Six patients were treated with local excision, one with a wide excision, and one patient with fibromatosis was treated with medical therapy. Median follow-up was 3.2 years (range, 16-92 months). One of the 5 patients with fibromatosis developed 2 recurrences. Neither of the 2 patients with sarcomas has developed metastasis. No patient has died of disease. We conclude that IAMT comprise 2 distinct groups-fibromatosis and sarcoma. Surgical trauma, perhaps occurring in patients with a predisposition to develop desmoid tumors, could account for fibromatosis in this setting. The causal relationship between implants and sarcomas is difficult to assess given the rarity of these tumors and that some may be radiation induced. However, at present, there is insufficient evidence to claim that they are biomaterial related."
"Tumoral calcinosis (TC) is a rare inherited disorder leading to the formation of periarticular calcified masses. Aspiration cytology of this condition has been rarely reported. We describe the aspiration cytology findings of a recent case of TC and discuss possible differential diagnoses. CASE: This is a case of a 35-year-old African-American man who presented with a right posterior chest/shoulder mass. The patient had a history of resection of right shoulder (1996) and left neck (2007) masses histologically diagnosed as TC. He recently also had a right-side neck mass that, surprisingly, was found to be extraabdominal desmoid fibromatosis on histologic examination. CONCLUSION: Inherited idiopathic TC is a rare disease commonly presenting as a periarticular mass, which may be subjected to aspiration biopsy. Awareness of this distinct entity and the aspiration cytologic features helps avoid incorrect interpretation."
"We describe a case of multiple desmoid tumors (DT) that developed in an ileal J pouch, which were successfully treated by low-dose combination chemotherapy using vinblastine (VBL) and methotrexate (MTX). Serial changes in the serum D-dimer levels reflected the treatment response. DT involving both the abdominal wall and the ileal pouch developed after total proctocolectomy with ileoanal anastomosis for familial adenomatous polyposis in a 26-year-old female who was treated in an outpatient unit with low-dose VBL and MTX biweekly for 12 months. The treatment response was assessed at routine intervals by physical examination and abdominal computer tomography (CT) imaging. We assessed serial changes in plasma D-dimers, a potential marker for angiogenic activity, during the low-dose VBL and MTX treatment. DT were successfully treated with low-dose VBL and MTX chemotherapy without any significant side effects or pouch sacrifice. Abdominal CT imaging revealed a decrease in tumor size, and the plasma D-dimer levels decreased in association with tumor regression. This case report shows the efficacy of a low-dose combination chemotherapeutic regimen of VBL and MTX for the treatment of ileoanal pouch mesenteric DT in an outpatient setting. In addition, plasma D-dimers may be a marker for desmoid tumor treatment efficacy."
"Abdominal desmoid tumors arise in young adults between 20 and 40 years. They are characterized by a local recurrence in 20 to 30% of cases. AIM: review the clinical and pathologic features of this entity, look for the expression of immunohistochemical markers (actine, desmine, CD34, vimentin) and also to estimate the expression of two potential targets therapy; the hormonal receptors and the CD117. METHODS: From 1990 to 2004, three cases of abdominal desmoid tumors were diagnosed in the Pathologic laboratory of the Charles Nicole Hospital of Tunis. RESULTS: The study concerned three women 62, 35 and 30 year-old. All the patients were operated and the size of tumours varied to 5 to 7cm. The CD117 and the hormonal receptors were negative in every case. None of the patients presented local recurrence. CONCLUSION: Abdominal desmoid tumors are locally aggressive but never give metastasis. The negativity of these lesions to the CD117 and in the hormonal receptors does not imply resistance in the hormonal treatment by anti-estrogens."
"Infantile desmoplastic fibromatoses are benign fibrous tissue tumours, non-metastasizing but locally aggressive and with high likelihood of recurrence. Many cases occur in young children between 18 months and 3 years and commonly present as painless mass of the submandibular region. The maxilla is rarely involved. AIM: Through this report and a review of literature, we are going to study clinical, pathological and prognostic characteristics of this affection. CASE REPORT: We report here a case of an aggressive desmoplastic fibroma arising in a 20-months-old infant originating in the left anterior maxillary wall. Clinical examination of the face revealed a non tender, firm, expansion of the left maxilla of 2.5 cm of diameter. The diagnosis of DF of the maxilla was made on the basis of histological features on biopsy specimen. No other location of the fibromatosis was found. The child had a favourable course. CONCLUSION: DF is an intraosseous, non metastasizing and locally aggressive fibrous tumour. Although its benignity, it could engage vital prognosis since it can extend into vital organs."
"Desmoid tumor is a rare benign tumor derived from fibrous sheath or musculoaponeurotic structure. The tumor is benign histologically but considered as malignant clinically because it has high propensity on infiltrative growth with local invasion and tendency to recurrence after local excision. Especially, when this tumor happens to be in the intra-abdomen, the prognosis is worse because it can cause intestinal obstruction, ureter obstruction and, fistula formation. It also can invade major vessels in abdomen. This tumor occurs more frequently in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), in post-partume women, and at old surgical incision site. However, in this case, the patient had neither previous surgery nor a FAP history. We report a rare case of the young male patient who presented with an acute abdomen and underwent laparotomy and was found to have an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor with abscess formation."
"Tumours of the brachial plexus region are rare and most publications are case reports or studies with a small series of patients. The aim of this study is to present our experience in managing these lesions. METHODS: We review 18 patients with tumours in the brachial plexus region submitted to surgical treatment in a 6 year period, including their clinical presentation, neuro-imaging data, surgical findings and outcome. FINDINGS: The tumours comprised a heterogeneous group of lesions, including schwannomas, neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (MPNST), sarcomas, metastases, desmoids and an aneurysmal bone cyst. The most common presentation was an expanding lump (83.33%). Eleven tumours were benign and 7 were malignant. Neurofibromatosis was present in only 2 patients (11.11%). Gross total resection was achieved in 14 patients and sub-total resection in the others. Only 3 patients presented with new post-operative motor deficits. The incidence of complications was low (16.5 %). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of tumours were benign and most of them could be excised with a low incidence of additional deficits. Some of the malignant tumours could be controlled by surgery plus adjuvant therapy, but this category is still associated with high morbidity and mortality rates."
"We present the case of a 23-year-old woman with aggressive fibromatosis of the oropharynx that was initially treated elsewhere as a peritonsillar abscess. We discuss the characteristics of this rare tumor and review the literature, stressing the importance of postoperative follow-up for peritonsillar abscesses to avoid missing other important diagnoses, such as the one described here."
"The development of a mass in a surgical scar poses a diagnostic dilemma due to similarities in appearance to hernias, abscesses, hematomas or desmoid tumors. Scar endometriosis is uncommon and malignant change within this ectopic tissue is rare. CASE REPORT: The case of a 55-year-old woman with an isolated clear cell adenocarcinoma in an area of scar endometriosis more than 17 years after a cesarean section is presented. Initially, this tumor was thought to be a chronic abscess, but was finally diagnosed as clear cell carcinoma. This case highlights the difficulties in preoperative diagnosis as well as the poor prognosis of these tumors. CONCLUSION: Accurate diagnosis of a lump within a scar is important to define the prognosis and treatment. Further data are needed for the management of this pathology."
"Desmoid tumors are associated with a variable and unpredictable clinical course. Surgery is the therapeutic mainstay, but there has been much discussion of late regarding its proper application. Little is known regarding the molecular determinates of desmoid tumor behavior. Some recent work has focused on the role of beta-catenin in desmoid tumor biology. RECENT FINDINGS: Given the variable clinical course of desmoid tumors, the interpretation of factors classically associated with recurrence such as microscopic status of margins appears more nuanced that previously thought. The application of multidisciplinary assessment with multimodality treatment, including surgery, radiation and systemic therapies may underlie these changes and now form the basis of care for this tumor. The precise CTNNB1 mutation present appears to be strongly predictive of recurrence after initial resection in one large, retrospective, multivariate analysis. SUMMARY: Establishing the population benefiting most from various treatment modalities and combinations is critical for progress in this disease. Assessment and treatment of individual patients in a multidisciplinary setting is critical to achieve the most favorable outcome. Additional study of the molecular determinates of desmoid behavior is needed to guide therapeutic selection."
"Gardner's syndrome, a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis, is characterized by colonic polyposis, osteomas, and soft tissue tumors. Adrenal masses in Gardner's syndrome are rare, and few have displayed clinical manifestations. We report a 16-year-old female with Gardner's syndrome, who had an aldosterone-secreting tumor resected via laparoscopic adrenalectomy."
"We describe herein a case of sporadic retroperitoneal aggressive fibromatosis. A 54-year-old man with a palpable abdominal mass was referred to our hospital for investigation and treatment. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed a solid mass with relatively well-defined borders in the left abdominal retroperitoneum. At surgery, a large tumor (14 x 13 x 11 cm) was found, arising from the retroperitoneal space and involving the wall of jejunum. Complete removal was achieved. Histological examination of the resected specimen revealed the presence of changes consistent with aggressive fibromatosis. The patient was not scheduled for any further treatment. Two years after surgery, the patient is without any signs of recurrent disease. Although extremely rare, aggressive fibromatosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of retroperitoneal masses. Complete surgical resection with negative pathological margins remains the first line management of these neoplasms. Careful follow-up is indicated because recurrence may occur every time after surgery."
"Idiopathic gingival fibromatosis, a benign, slow-growing proliferation of the gingival tissues, is genetically heterogeneous. This condition is usually part of a syndrome or, rarely, an isolated disorder. Aggressive periodontitis, another genetically transmitted disorder of the periodontium, typically results in severe, rapid destruction of the toothsupporting apparatus. The increased susceptibility of the host population with aggressive periodontitis may be caused by the combined effects of multiple genes and their interaction with various environmental factors. Functional abnormalities of neutrophils have also been implicated in the etiopathogenesis of aggressive periodontitis. We present a rare case of a nonsyndromic idiopathic gingival fibromatosis associated with generalized aggressive periodontitis. We established the patient""s diagnosis through clinical and radiologic assessment, histopathologic findings and immunologic analysis of neutrophil function with a nitro-blue-tetrazolium reduction test. We describe an interdisciplinary approach to the treatment of the patient."
"To evaluate the role of radiation therapy (RT) as a component of multimodality therapy for pediatric desmoids. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-one children diagnosed between 1987 and 2005 were identified. Median age at start of treatment was 13 years (range, 2-21). Primary therapy consisted of resection alone (10), resection + external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) (5), resection + chemotherapy (CT; 3), EBRT alone (1), and CT alone (2). RESULTS: The median follow-up from start of treatment is 75.7 months (range, 16-162). Examining patients with gross total resections (GTRs) (-) margins and those who had GTRs (+) margins followed by EBRT, only 2 of 7 failed primary treatment. Conversely, 13 of 14 patients with other primary treatments failed locally. Of the 15 patients who recurred, only 1 patient had a GTR (-) margins. Seven of these patients had salvage therapy that did not include RT, and of these only 2 have no evidence of disease (NED) at last follow-up. In contrast, the remaining 8 patients received RT as a component of their final salvage therapy and 7 of these are NED at last follow-up. At last follow-up, no patient has died, although toxicities of therapy have occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Local control is difficult to achieve in pediatric patients with desmoids. In the setting in which negative surgical margins cannot be achieved, RT plays a key role in achieving NED status. Even after multiple recurrences, successful salvage is achievable, particularly when high-dose focal therapy is incorporated."
"Desmoid tumours are uncommon benign tumours but with aggressive behaviour, resulting from the proliferation of well-differentiated fibroblasts. Clinically, they present as a painless firm soft tissue mass. They can be solitary or multiple and have potential infiltrative capacity. When planning treatment, it is important to assess the correct tumour extent to permit curative radical surgery minimizing possible local recurrence. Different imaging techniques help to characterise these tumours. At present, magnetic resonance is the tool of choice for studying these tumours. The role of nuclear medicine techniques, such as bone scintigraphy, or more recently FDG-PET, has not been defined in the evaluation of these neoplasms. We present the case of a patient with a desmoid tumour of the abdominal-chest wall and we review the related literature."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) is usually a slowly growing locally invasive tumor, but may exhibit a much more aggressive phenotype. The role of chemotherapy in AF is not well defined, but can be useful in some cases. We examined the response of a case to both imatinib and sunitinib. METHODS: We report a case of an aggressive multicentric extra-abdominal AF that was responsive to sunitinib, but resistant to imatinib. RESULTS: A 23-year-old woman developed painful multifocal AF of both legs and gluteal muscles that progressed after surgery and treatment with methotrexate/vinblastine and pegylated-liposomal doxorubicin. She received six cycles of ifosfamide/etoposide (IMV), and obtained a good response with elimination of pain. After 5 months, she developed progression and again received six cycles of IMV, with cessation of symptoms. After 13 months, tumors recurred. Although the AF was symptomatic and progressing, she was hesitant to receive chemotherapy and began treatment with sunitinib 50 mg/day for 28 days of a 42-day cycle. At 4 months, she could walk on her heels without pain. After 13 months of sunitinib, therapy was changed to imatinib 400 mg/day; after 7 days she noticed increasing pain in the AF lesions and decreased knee flexibility. Imatinib was continued, but after 2 months of imatinib, she could only walk a few steps due to pain. Sunitinib was reinstituted at 37.5 mg/day and symptoms improved within 1.5 weeks, with a marked reduction of symptoms at 1 month. She was doing well with a normal activity level, 32 months after initially beginning sunitinib. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that sunitinib may be useful in some cases of AF."
"MYH-associated polyposis is an inherited autosomal recessive disease, linked to biallelic germline MYH mutations, which predisposes to the development of multiple colorectal adenomas and cancer. The colonic and extracolonic phenotype of this syndrome is very heterogeneous. We report the case of a young male patient with an aggressive MYH-associated polyposis phenotype. He presented at aged 30 years with more than 100 colonic polyps and 4 colonic adenocarcinomas. At aged 35 years, Spigelman Stage IV duodenal adenomatosis was detected. When he was 39 years old, he developed three synchronous jejunal adenocarcinomas and a mesenteric desmoid tumor. Based on this report, we believe that screening of the entire small bowel should be recommended in MYH-associated polyposis patients, especially in those with duodenal adenomas. Similar to patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, desmoid tumors also may be part of the clinical spectrum of MYH-associated polyposis and may prove to be a significant clinical problem in patients submitted to prophylactic colectomy."
"Gardner's syndrome is a clinical subgroup of familial adenomatous polyposis, an autosomal dominant disease. It is characterized by gastrointestinal polyps and extra-intestinal manifestations including multiple osteomas, skin and soft tissue tumours. Aggressive desmoid tumours can be very difficult to manage in patients with Gardner's syndrome. We present a case of a 17-year-old female who presented with an aggressive desmoid tumor arising of the lumbar area as part of her Gardner's syndrome. She was treated with surgery, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tamoxifen and radiotherapy, and was followed up for 80 months. We conclude that desmoid tumors can precede gastrointestinal manifestations of familial adenomatous polyposis or Gardner's syndrome. Such patients should be evaluated with genetic testing followed by colonoscopy. Desmoid tumours should be managed in a multidisciplinary setting, as well."
"After proctocolectomy, ileal pouch-anal anastomosis may not be feasible, especially in the case of desmoid tumor or after failed ileal pouch-anal anastomosis requiring excision of the pouch. We designed a gastric pouch interposed between the terminal ileum and the anus to avoid a permanent ileostomy for these patients. Long-term results and quality of life with this technique remain unknown. METHODS: After proctocolectomy, ileal pouch-anal anastomosis was not feasible or had failed in 3 patients (2 with familial adenomatous polyposis and 1 with ulcerative colitis; 40, 49, and 50 years of age, respectively). Of these patients, 2 had undergone end ileostomy 7 and 8 years previously. A pouch was created using the left half of the gastric fundus, supplied through the right gastroepiploic vessels; the pouch was anastomosed proximally to the terminal ileum and distally to the anus. Diverting ileostomy was performed in all patients. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 6 years, all 3 patients were highly satisfied with the operation and described their quality of life as good. The median stool frequency during the day and night were 6 and 1, respectively. No patient reported incontinence or urgency. Of the 3 patients, 2 had minimal soiling with gastric juice; 1 patient had anastomotic ulcers with bleeding requiring resection with reanastomosis. All of the patients needed long-term proton pump inhibitor therapy and topical perianal treatment to prevent skin burning. CONCLUSION: Inter-ileoanal gastroplasty is a surgical salvage technique that can avoid a permanent ileostomy. The procedure provides a good quality of life for patients with unfeasible or failed ileal pouch."
"Desmoid tumor, also known as aggressive fibromatosis or desmoid-type fibromatosis, is a rare monoclonal, fibroblastic proliferation arising in musculoaponeurotic structures. Although histologically benign, desmoids are often locally invasive and associated with a high local recurrence rate after resection. Since it is a heterogeneous disease, in particular regarding clinical presentation, anatomic location and biological behavior, treatment should be individualized to reduce local tumor control failure with concurrently acceptable morbidity and preservation of quality of life. Many issues regarding optimal treatment of desmoids remain controversial. However, wide surgical excision remains the treatment of choice, except when surgery is mutilating and is associated with considerable function loss or major morbidity. Involvement of surgical margins is probably associated with an increased risk of local recurrence. Postoperative radiotherapy results in a significant reduction of the local recurrence rate, but only in the case of involved surgical margins. Radiotherapy for gross disease is considerably effective, but is associated with a relatively high rate of complications, which are usually mild or moderate and radiation dose dependent. Radiotherapy should only be applied where anatomic constraints preclude complete resection and radiotherapy is not too toxic. Risk factors for local tumor control failure include young age, large size, presentation as recurrent disease, limb/girdle or intra-abdominal location, involved surgical margins, omission of radiotherapy, radiation dose less than 50 Gy and insufficient radiation field size. Increased comprehension of the pathogenesis and biological behavior of desmoids resulted in the emerging applicability of systemic therapies and a wait-and-see policy. Systemic treatment may be indicated in patients that have anatomic barriers to effective surgery or radiotherapy. Considering the significant morbidity of surgery and/or radiotherapy for certain locations, especially mutilation and loss of function, and the tumor's natural history, which is often characterized by prolonged periods of stability or even regression, a period of watchful waiting may compose the most appropriate management in selected asymptomatic patients. Attempts to complete eradication of the disease may be worse than the disease itself."
"Extra-abdominal fibromatosis is an uncommon benign breast lesion resembling an infiltrative carcinoma in its clinical and radiological presentation. Surgical excision with wide margins remains the treatment of choice to avoid recurrence of this locally aggressive tumor. We present a case in which surgical biopsy allowed the diagnosis of a breast fibromatosis and we discuss its clinical, diagnostic, pathological and therapeutic particularities."
"Desmoid tumor is a noncapsulated neoplasia, locally aggressive, originated from the fibroblasts of the musculo-aponeurotic tissues. Even though with no malignant behavior, such as the ability of generating metastasis or of invasion, the desmoid tumor has a high tendency for local growth, causing deformities in the adjacent organs, pain and sometimes organ dysfunction, depending on the area involved. We report the case of a large intra-abdominal desmoid tumor, invading pelvic organs in a 53 year-old patient. The neoplasia has been totally extirpated and, at the moment, five years after the surgery, the patient presents no clinical or radiologic sign of lesion relapse."
"The extraordinary success of imatinib in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) represents a model for molecularly targeted therapy for other solid tumors. Research is currently going to identify the molecular basis of mechanisms of action and drug resistance. In this article, we review recent advances in the clinical management of patients with GISTs treated with imatinib, but also of patients with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, chordoma, aggressive fibromatosis, and some other common solid tumors treated with this drug. We reviewed the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that are basic to imatinib effects in these tumors."
"Desmoid tumors are benign tumors that cause considerable morbidity and are prone to recurrence. They tend to extensively infiltrate surrounding tissues, complicating the treatment. We present the report of two cases of desmoid tumor in the pediatric population. The first patient had tumor that necessitated removal of most of the anterior compartment of his leg. The tumor in the second case was intimately involved with neurovascular structures and, therefore adjuvant treatment including chemotherapy and repeat surgery was necessary. We present these cases as well as a review of the literature to illustrate the challenges in diagnosing and treating pediatric desmoid tumors."
"Using a preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiation protocol, followed by complete excision, we have achieved local control rates exceeding that found in most large series. METHODS: From October 1990 through May 2008, resectable desmoids were initially treated with a preoperative protocol using Adriamycin 30 mg x 3 days continuous intravenous infusion followed by 3,000 cGy of radiation (300 cGy fractions over 10 days). Resection was performed 4-6 weeks later. After 2001, all patients were initially offered Tamoxifen 120 mg/day and Celebrex 400 mg/day for 1 year. Patients who progressed on Tamox/Celeb were treated with protocol and those with stabilization or regression were observed. Patient demographics, tumor size, history of previous recurrences, and follow-up status were recorded prospectively. RESULTS: There were 40 females and 12 males with a mean follow-up of 45 months. Forty patients presented with primary tumors and eight presented with recurrent disease. Thirty-nine patients had surgical resection and 13 were observed. Thirty patients underwent the neoadjuvant protocol. Tamoxifen and Celebrex were used in 16 patients, 6 had stabilization in growth, 1 had a 50% reduction in the size of the tumor, there was 1 complete regression, and 8 progressed. Of the patients who had resectable disease Tamoxifen and Celebrex obviated surgery in 30%. Overall 13% (5) of patients developed a recurrence. There were three recurrences among the protocol group for a local control rate of 90%. CONCLUSION: Although our neoadjuvant protocol demonstrates the best results to date in eradication of disease, an initial conservative approach is reasonable to determine who would most benefit from surgery."
"Desmoid tumor, also known as aggressive fibromatosis, is a rare soft tissue tumor. For those cases localized in the anterior abdominal wall, radical resection and reconstruction with a mesh is indicated. Because the rarity of the disease, randomized trials are lacking, but in reported retrospective series, it is clear that although it is considered a benign lesion, local recurrence is not uncommon. METHODS: We analyzed the records of 14 consecutive patients (3 men, 11 women, mean age 36 years, range 25-51 years) with desmoid tumor of the anterior abdominal wall treated at the European Institute of Oncology. The surgical strategy was the same in all cases: wide surgical excision and immediate plastic reconstruction with mesh after intraoperative confirmation by frozen sections of disease-free margins of >1 cm. We considered long-term outcomes by using the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 as an instrument to evaluate the overall quality of the treatment delivered to these patients. RESULTS: No immediate postoperative complication was registered, and no patient developed recurrence after a median follow-up period of 55 months. Two women experienced mesh bulging within 1 year after the operation. The long-term mean global health status registered was 97 out of 100. CONCLUSIONS: Radical resection aided by intraoperative margin evaluation via frozen sections followed by immediate mesh reconstruction is a safe procedure and can provide definitive cure without functional limitations for patients with desmoid tumors of the anterior abdominal wall."
"Desmoids are infiltrative, locally destructive, soft tissue tumors. Although they do not metastasize, the incidence of local recurrence is quite high. AIM: Present study aimed at reporting the 10-year experience of 32 desmoid cases and reviewing some facts with symptoms, investigation, and treatment of the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty two cases of desmoid tumors were reviewed over a 10-year span. Surgical resection and adjuvant radiotherapy were the treatments of choice whenever histological margins were positive. RESULTS: Multiparous women in reproductive age were the most commonly afflicted. The commonest site of presentation was the abdominal wall. Ninety one percent (20/22) were infraumbilical. The tumors were found in the rectus sheath in 14 patients (64%) and were laterally situated in 8 patients (36%). Local infiltration was found in six patients and the urinary bladder was most commonly involved (3/6). Locally recurrent desmoids were seen in eight patients (25%). CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, 25% of the desmoid tumors (8/32) were recurrent and postoperative radiotherapy did not seem to influence the local recurrence rate. The most important predictor for recurrence was tumors of > 5 cm."
"Presented is the case of a 61-year-old male patient with a chronic thoracic wall defect, including a bronchopleural fistula, after multiple resections of a desmoid tumor. After partial lung resection to remove the bronchopleural fistula, dead space was partially obliterated and the thoracic wall reconstructed with a free combined intra- and extrathoracic rectus abdominis muscle flap."
"Desmoid tumour is an uncommon, locally invasive non-metastasizing neoplastic lesion. The pathogenesis of this tumour is unclear and its treatment is controversial. In this paper, the authors report a new case of chest wall desmoid tumour in a 67-year-old man previously operated by sternotomy for a triple aortocoronary bypass. To the best of our knowledge only two cases of thoracic desmoid tumours following aortocoronary bypass have been reported in literature. The correlation between the site of the surgical approach and the tumour, and the time interval between surgery and presentation, supports the hypothesis of a causal role of surgical trauma in the occurrence of this tumour. The Authors discuss the pathogenesis of this tumour with review of the current literature."
"Giant cell tumor of tendon sheath is a rare cause of ulnar tunnel syndrome. We present a case of a 37-year-old woman who presented with decreased sensation and weakness of grip of the right hand. Magnetic resonance imaging indicated the presence of a mass in the hypothenar eminence and showed that the mass was associated with the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon and displacing the ulnar neurovascular bundle. A differential diagnosis included desmoid tumor and sarcoma. METHODS: Surgical examination showed a mass that was associated with the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon and flexor retinaculum located in the distal portion of Guyon's canal and intertwined with the ulnar nerve and displacing the ulnar artery. The mass was removed and Guyon's canal was released. RESULTS: Histological examination indicated a diagnosis of giant cell tumor of tendon sheath (GCTTS). Postoperatively, the patient had fully restored sensory and motor function of the right hand. CONCLUSIONS: Although GCTTS is the most common solid, soft-tissue lesion of the hand, it is rarely diagnosed properly preoperatively. Therefore, it is imperative to always include GCTTS in the differential diagnosis of any mass of the hand."
"We present a case report that describes the pathology, presentation, and management complexities of an unusual, destructive fibrosclerotic lesion of the laryngotracheal complex. An otherwise healthy 21-year-old man presented with a 1-year history of progressive shortness of breath and stridor. The initial examination revealed a 3-cm, grade III subglottic stenosis. Nodular fibrosis of the strap muscles, laryngotracheal cartilages, and trachea was evident. Biopsies revealed dense peritracheal desmoplastic reaction with focal erosion of cartilage. However, features diagnostic for relapsing polychondritis, desmoid tumor, or orbital pseudotumor were absent. The disease progressed to involve severe stenosis and thickening of the trachea and main stem bronchi. Surgical and medical management of this unusual fibrosclerotic lesion did not ameliorate the disease process, but a recent encouraging response to tamoxifen citrate has been observed with improvements in vocal fold motion and activity levels. Prognosis and management experience for this unknown pathologic entity are absent in the literature. In this case, diffuse disease progression occurred despite surgical and medical management, but has been halted by tamoxifen therapy. The prospect of a durable response and disease remission is unknown."

"Desmoid tumors are benign but locally invasive myofibroblastic lesions that arise predominantly in the abdominal wall or shoulder and are prone to aggressive local recurrences. A perceived association between desmoid activity and the expression of growth factors during pregnancy or following trauma suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between growth factor stimulation and desmoid invasiveness. We used Boyden Chambers to quantify cell motility in order to determine the effect of growth factor stimulation on desmoid cell migration. Desmoid cell cultures were treated under serum-free conditions with epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) or transforming growth factor alpha (rhTGFalpha). Additional cell cultures were pretreated under serum-free conditions with the EGF receptor (EGFR) inhibitor AG1478, alone or in combination with the TGFbeta1 receptor inhibitor SB431542, and then stimulated with growth factor prior to being assayed for cell motility. The experiments demonstrated a direct dose-dependent relationship between rhEGF stimulation and desmoid motility. In contrast, rhTGFalpha was less effective at inducing cell migration. rhEGF-induced cell migration could be diminished, but not reduced to control levels, by inhibiting EGFR. When EGF and TGFbeta1 receptors were inhibited simultaneously, the level of rhEGF-induced cell migration was reduced significantly beyond the level of cell migration generated by inhibition of EGFR alone."
"To describe the sonographic imaging characteristics of abdominal and extraabdominal desmoids. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 12 histologically and pathologically proven abdominal and extraabdominal desmoids. Two radiologists with musculoskeletal sonography experience reviewed sonographic images for lesion location, size, echotexture, and vascularity with agreement by consensus. RESULTS: Desmoids were seen in 9 females and 3 males. They manifested as slowly growing masses. Nine lesions were intramuscular and 3 were found within the subcutaneous adipose tissue. A typical sonographic feature of all intramuscular desmoids was the spindle-shaped margin at the tumor ends when scanned along the long axis of the affected muscle. The desmoids arising from the fascia had an irregular shape. Tumor vascularity was rich in 6 cases and poor in 6 cases. A fibrillar pattern within the tumor was found in 75% of the cases. CONCLUSION: A spindle-shaped appearance is common in intramuscular desmoids. Hyperechoic areas and a fibrillar pattern within desmoids are also common sonographic features."

"Macrophages play an important role in breast carcinogenesis. The pathways that mediate the macrophage contribution to breast cancer and the heterogeneity that exists within macrophages are incompletely understood. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) is the primary regulator of tissue macrophages. The purpose of this study was to define a novel CSF1 response signature and to evaluate its clinical and biological significance in breast cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We defined the CSF1 response signature by identifying genes overexpressed in tenosynovial giant cell tumor and pigmented villonodular synovitis (tumors composed predominantly of macrophages recruited in response to the overexpression of CSF1) compared with desmoid-type fibromatosis and solitary fibrous tumor. To characterize the CSF1 response signature in breast cancer, we analyzed the expression of CSF1 response signature genes in eight published breast cancer gene expression data sets (n = 982) and did immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization for CSF1 response genes on a breast cancer tissue microarray (n = 283). RESULTS: In both the gene microarray and tissue microarray analyses, a consistent subset (17-25%) of breast cancers shows the CSF1 response signature. The signature is associated with higher tumor grade, decreased expression of estrogen receptor, decreased expression of progesterone receptor, and increased TP53 mutations (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the CSF1 response signature is consistently seen in a subset of breast carcinomas and correlates with biological features of the tumor. Our findings provide insight into macrophage biology and may facilitate the development of personalized therapy for patients most likely to benefit from CSF1-targeted treatments."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) is a benign tumour with expansive and locally invasive growth. It is very rarely seen in the head and neck area. We present a 52-year-old female patient with AF localized to the left frontal sinus. The condition was initially mistaken for chronic sinusitis however computed tomography indicated tumour. A biopsy showed AF and the patient received surgical treatment. Symptoms, signs and treatment are discussed. It is concluded that AF in the sino-nasal tract is a rare, but potentially life threatening condition which might be mistaken for a simple sinusitis."

" ratio of 1:1 with an average age of 5.3 (standard deviation [SD] +/- 4.5) years. There appeared to be left-sided predominance of desmoid tumors in the pediatric mandible with a ratio of 3:1. The mean size of the tumors was 4.6 cm (SD +/- 2.1) at the largest diameter. We have tabulated the relevant data of all the cases including the methods of treatment and recurrence. It is found that when compared with conservative management, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and curettage or surgical local excisions as treatment options the most efficient treatment was partial mandiblectomy, which resulted in complete tumor dissipation with no tumor recurrence. In summary, this is the largest review of the pediatric desmoid tumor of the mandible to date where we provide for the first time an algorithm for the management and treatment of the pediatric desmoid tumor of the mandible."
"Gardner syndrome (GS) is an abnormality of familial adenomatous polyposis accompanied by characteristic jaw lesions. Gardner syndrome intestinal polyps have a 100% risk of undergoing malignant transformation; consequently, early identification and surgical intervention of the disease are important to prolong the life of the patient. We present a case of GS in a 55-year-old woman. Familial adenomatous polyposis, osteomatous jaw and ocular lesions, several dental abnormalities, and an abdominal desmoid tumor are the characteristic features of this case. This case demonstrates the presence of unusual, widespread, hereditary, osteomatous jaw lesions that caused diagnostic confusion with familial gigantiform cementoma."
"pRb, p16, and proliferating antigens: Ki-67, PCNA, MCM5 with immunohistochemical method in archival material derived from 27 extra-abdominal (E-AD), 18 abdominal (AD) and 5 intra-abdominal (I-AD) cases of desmoid tumor. None of the examined cases (n=50) of aggressive fibromatosis was pRb-immunonegative. Heterogeneous expression of pRb was observed in 51.85% (14/27) of Group AD cases and in 5.56% (1/18) of Group E-AD cases; positive expression in 48,15% (13/27) of Group AD cases, in 94.44% (17/18) of Group E-AD cases, and in 100% (5/5) of Group I-AD cases. There were no negative cases for p16 staining in any of the examined groups. The number of heterogeneous cases in individual groups was: 33.33% (9/27) in Group AD, 50% (9/18) in Group E-AD and 40% (2/5) in Group I-AD, and positive cases: 66.67% (18/27), 50% (9/18) and 60% (3/5), respectively. Overexpression of PCNA was noted in 98% (49/50) of cases. The positive staining for Ki-67 protein was noted in 25.93% (7/27) in Group AD, in 16.67% (3/18) in Group E-AD and in 60% (3/5) in Group I-AD. None of the examined cases was immunopositive for MCM5 protein. The noted levels of pRb and p16 expression in desmoid cells reflect their function in cell cycle regulation. Probably the unsettled cell cycle progression, especially in G1 phase, is not the cause of aggressive fibromatosis pathogenesis."
"APC protein, alpha-, beta-catenin, and N-cadherin in archival material derived from 15 cases of extra-abdominal desmoid tumor (E-AD) and 20 cases of abdominal (AD) desmoid tumor. The tested proteins demonstrated cytoplasmic (c) staining. Furthermore, nuclear (n) or cytoplasmic and nuclear (c+n) staining was observed for beta-catenin. The mean values of the percentage of positive cells for the tested proteins between E-AD vs. AD did not demonstrate any statistically significant difference except for alpha-catenin. In the E-AD group, in both cases of recurrent tumors, no alpha-catenin expression was observed but the expression of this protein was detected in primary tumors. In the groups investigated, no statistically significant correlation was found between alpha-catenin, beta-catenin (c), (n) and (c+n) expression, and tumor size (p>0.1). The results regarding beta-catenin expression obtained in our study confirm the previous findings that nuclear accumulation of this protein plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of aggressive fibromatosis."
"Fibromatosis is a rare, locally aggressive but non-metastasising fibrous mass often associated with familial adenomatous polyposis in Gardner's Syndrome (GS). Although sporadic cases occur, unlike in GS, they are predominantly extra-abdominal. We report the case of a 40-year-old lady who underwent laparotomy for a large isolated abdominal mass three years after a Whipple's procedure for adenocarcinoma of the distal common bile duct. A spherical, football sized tumour was found in the jejunal mesentery. Resection of the tumour with jejunum was carried out. No metastasis was detected. This case is peculiar in that mesenteric fibromatosis occurred in a patient with prior history of periampullary carcinoma and without history of familial adenomatous polyposis."
"In two patients, a man aged 43 and a woman aged 40 years, who presented with a desmoid tumour, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) was diagnosed three and six years later, respectively. The second patient had developed metastatic rectal cancer. Desmoid-type fibromatoses usually develop sporadically, but may also be an extracolonic manifestation of FAP. All patients with desmoids diagnosed who are under age 60, or with desmoids located intra-abdominally or in the abdominal wall, should be referred for colonic and genetic evaluation. In all further patients with a desmoid tumour, the possibility of FAP should be considered and patient data and the family history should be evaluated thoroughly. If FAP is suspected, patients should be referred for colonoscopic examination and genetic evaluation."
"Desmoid tumor of the breast is a rare fibroblastic disease, a slow-growing and histologically benign lesion that accounts for 0.2% of all breast tumors. It can arise either primarily from the breast parenchyma or, by secondary invasion, from the muscolo-aponeurotic layer of the pectoral muscles. These tumors do not metastatize, have no capsule but do have the propensity to aggressively invade local tissues and organs. It has been suggested that these tumours are associated with surgical and non-surgical tissue trauma, certain hormones and genetic susceptibility. We describe two cases of breast desmoid tumor after breast augmentation. A 52-year-old caucasian woman and 38-year-old caucasian woman presented for a breast implant change. During surgery an inelastic, soft, capsulated mass, arising from the periprosthetic capsula in the area of pectoralis major muscle was found. The mass was removed en bloc together with a portion of the periprosthetic capsula, the resection including a portion of the pectoralis major muscle fascia in both cases. The results of this histological examination suggested an extra-abdominal desmoid tumor. To date both the local and the general conditions of the two patients are good, with no signs of recurrence of the lesion."
"To identify local and distant complications of patients with soft tissue tumours and evaluate their relationships to types of therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-one patients (29 males and 22 females, ages 14-80 years) with 34 malignant and 17 benign soft tissue tumours were evaluated for local and distant complications after resection or amputation only (26 patients) or after the addition of radiotherapy (25 patients: 17 patients had external beam therapy, 7 patients had external beam therapy and brachytherapy, and one patient had extracorporeal irradiation and reimplantation). Duration of follow-up averaged 3.75 years for malignant tumours and 2.79 years for benign tumours. Follow-up studies included radiography, T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), computed tomography for thoracic and abdominal metastases, and 3-phase technetium-99m-labeled-methylene-diphosphonate scintigraphy for bone metastases. RESULTS: Recurrent tumours were 2.2 times more frequent in patients who had undergone their initial resection at an outside hospital as compared with those first treated at the university hospital. Nine of 11 recurrences occurred after marginal surgery. Metastases from soft tissue sarcomas, most commonly to lung (nine patients) and to bone and muscle (five patients), showed no specific relationship to type of therapy. DCE-MRI differentiated rapidly enhancing soft tissue recurrences (11 patients) and residual tumours (6 patients) from slowly enhancing muscle inflammation, and non-enhancing fibrosis and seromas that usually did not enhance. Seromas developed in 76% of patients who had postoperative radiation therapy and in 7.7% of patients who had only surgery. Subcutaneous and cutaneous oedema and muscle inflammation was at least four times more frequent after adjunct radiotherapy than after resection alone. Irrespective of the type of treatment, inflammatory changes in muscle and subcutaneous and cutaneous tissue and the majority of seromas were evident at the first follow-up study. Although seromas after resection and external beam therapy resolved with time, seromas after additional brachytherapy persisted. Inflammatory changes in muscle and cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue after resection alone disappeared by the second follow-up study, whereas these changes after radiotherapy resolved months to years after treatment. Fourteen of 51 patients showed MR findings of chronic muscular atrophy, predominantly located in the lower extremity. Heterotopic ossification was seen in three patients after resection and amputation without radiotherapy. Except for one patient with aggressive fibromatosis, bone and nerve complications occurred in patients with soft tissue malignancy. Twelve patients had osteoporosis. Six patients sustained fractures in irradiated osteoporotic bone of the lower extremity, and one patient had a vertebral fracture in radiographically normal but irradiated bone. In addition, one patient was found to have a medullary infarct in an irradiated femur. In nerve entrapment, DCE-MRI demonstrated the rapidly enhancing recurrent tumour or non-enhancing fibrosis surrounding the slowly enhancing nerve. T1- and T2-weighted MR images displayed the acute and chronic sequelae of nerve entrapment and nerve transection with denervation as T2-hyperintense acute muscle atrophy or T1-hypertense chronic fatty muscular atrophy with decrease in muscle volume. CONCLUSION: This study suggests a possible relationship between types of treatment of soft tissue tumours and subsequent complications. Postoperative radiotherapy was associated with a significant number of patients with seromas, muscle, cutaneous and subcutaneous inflammation, and fractures. Incomplete or difficult surgery resulted in residual or recurrent tumours and heterotopic ossification. Muscle atrophy and nerve entrapment were related to both treatments (resection alone or radiotherapy after resection). Diligent follow-up of patients with soft tissue tumours with recognition of these complications and their differentiation from recurrent or residual tumour can help guide clinical care and may negate the need for surgery when benign disease is defined."
"To report a case of rhabdomyolysis presenting with severe hyperkalemia after withdrawal of thyroid hormone in a patient with differentiated thyroid cancer. METHODS: We describe the clinical and laboratory findings of the study patient and review the relevant literature. RESULTS: A 54-year-old man with progressive generalized weakness and myalgias presented with acute renal failure and hyperkalemia. He had undergone total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer 6 weeks earlier and had discontinued thyroid hormone 2 weeks before his current presentation in preparation for thyroid remnant ablation. He had a history of multiple colon and small-bowel resections for familial adenomatous polyposis and desmoid tumor. He was severely dehydrated on examination. Laboratory tests results included the following values: creatine phosphokinase, 5265 U/L (reference range, 52-336 U/L); creatinine, 2.1 mg/dL; potassium, >8.0 mEq/L; and thyrotropin, 92.2 mIU/L. His condition was diagnosed as rhabdomyolysis, and his fluid deficit and hyperkalemia were treated aggressively. Cardiac status remained stable, and both acute renal failure and hyperkalemia improved. He then received remnant ablation, and thyroid hormone was restarted. His muscle complaints resolved over the following 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Hypothyroidism-induced rhabdomyolysis can occur during thyroid hormone withdrawal and can present with life-threatening hyperkalemia. Patients under-going thyroid hormone withdrawal should be assessed for risk of rhabdomyolysis, and preventive strategies should be implemented, including prevention of dehydration. The use of recombinant thyrotropin, rather than thyroid hormone withdrawal, should be considered in those who are at high risk for such complications."
"To explore the effects and complications of the total elbow arthroplasty after the resection of the peri-elbow tumor. METHODS: Between June 1998 to June 2007, 19 patients underwent total elbow arthroplasty after resection of tumors at the authors department, which involved 13 males and 6 females, including 6 patients with metastatic tumor, 1 with giant cell tumor of bone (GCT), 2 with malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), 4 with osteosarcoma, 3 with Ewing sarcoma, l with lymphoma, 1 with synovial sarcoma, and 1 with desmoid fibroma of the bone. The age of patients ranged from 15 to 71 years (mean 43 years). LOCATION: distal humerus in 9 cases, proximal ulna in 5 and the tumor involving both distal humerus and proximal ulna in 5 patients. RESULTS: Patients were evaluated according to the Mayo Elbow Performance Score. Pain scores decreased from a mean of 3.6 to 2.0. Mean arc of elbow motion from extention to flexion improved from 30 to 80 (range, 55 - 105). Fourteen elbows had excellent or good result (14/19, 77.8%), and 4 elbows had a poor result (22.2%). There was no wound infection or other complication after surgery. During the following up time, 2 patients with metastatic lung cancer, 1 with metastatic rectal cancer and 1 with ovarian cancer died in 2 years after surgery. Two Ewing sarcoma, 1 MFH and 1 osteosarcoma patients occurred lung metastasis (4/18, 22.2%), and two patients had local recurrence (11.1%). Three patients occurred complication during the following time (3/18, 16.7%), the stem of humerus prosthesis came out of channel in 1 case 5 years after surgery, the stem of ulna prosthesis came out of channel in 1 case 4 years after surgery, and both cases did revision surgery. The stem loosening was in 1 humerus prosthesis 4 years after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that total elbow arthroplasty after resection of tumors can decrease the pain, and improve the function substantially. For metastatic tumors, this technique also can be used if there is no other good option."
"Earlier detection of pancreatic cancer may help identify patients for whom surgical intervention could provide cure or prolong life. In this article, we report the occurrence of breast cancer, melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the alveolar ridge, colon cancer, a desmoid tumor of the abdominal wall, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma in a 65-year-old woman. She was identified as having the familial atypical multiple mole melanoma-pancreatic cancer syndrome (FAMMM-PC) with a germline p16 mutation at amino acid position 15. DISCUSSION: Patients with this syndrome traditionally present with multiple nevi and melanoma, and a subset also present with other cancers, including pancreatic cancer; however, no FAMMM-PC patient has yet been described with this constellation of cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma of the alveolar ridge and a desmoid tumor. Recognition of the tumors this population of patients is susceptible to developing and their genetic associations can help guide the surgeon in screening, surveillance, and eventually prevention of many of these cancers."
"To assess the outcome of patients with extra-abdominal desmoid tumor treated with low dose chemotherapy (methotrexate and vinblastine) both for tumor response and treatment related toxicity. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the outcome of 12 patients who underwent low dose chemotherapy for extra abdominal desmoid of different locations. The study took place in the McGill University Health Center, Montreal, Canada between 1996 and 2003. We evaluated the patients for their compliance, tumor response, complications of treatment, and impact of treatment on symptoms. There were 7 females and 5 males with a mean age of 46 years. RESULTS: Disease related morbidity included pain in 7 patients, functional limitation in 7 and cosmetic defects in 3. The mean tumor size was 11 cm (3-20 cm). The mean follow-up was 43 months (15-71 months). Chemotherapy was administered weekly. Complications were significant. Only 2 patients did not experience the toxicity. According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, 6 tumors showed a partial response and 6 remained stable. None showed progression. Of the 7 patients who had painful tumors, 6 achieved significant symptom relief. Function was improved in 3 and restored to normal in 4. Cosmesis was improved in 2 of the 3. At latest follow-up, tumors remained stable in 8, one has markedly regressed and 3 exhibited progression at an average of 54 months. Only one patient required surgery. The only long term side effect was a sensory peripheral neuropathy. CONCLUSION: Low dose chemotherapy was found to be a valuable adjunct to prevent local progression and improve symptoms."
"Soft tissue desmoid-type fibromatosis is a type of benign, infiltrative tumors which are rarely seen. This study was to analyze CT and MR manifestations and pathologic features of soft tissue desmoid-type fibromatosis to improve its diagnostic accuracy. METHODS: A total of 34 soft tissue desmoid-type fibromatosis from 29 patients, including 20 primary and 14 recurrent tumors were analyzed. Eight were scanned with CT, and 26 were scanned with MRI. Features of the growth pattern, CT or MRI findings and pathologic appearances of the tumors were studied. RESULTS: The mean size of the 34 tumors was 6.5 cm. Of the 34 tumors, 31(91.2%) had an ill-defined or partially ill-defined margin, 31(91.2%) had a lobulated or irregular contour, 17(50.0%) had neurovascular involvement, 15(44.1%) had bone involvement, 23(67.6%) had extra-compartmental extension. Among the eight tumors scanned by CT, six showed slight hypodensity on the non-enhanced CT scan, and seven were inhomogeneously enhanced after contrast injection. Twenty-six tumors scanned by MRI appeared either iso-or slightly hyperintense on T1W images, hyperintense on T2W images, and moderate or intense enhancement after gadolinium administration. Heterogeneous signal intensity was detected in 88.5%(23/26) tumors. Linear and curvilinear areas of signal void interspersed throughout the tumors were found in 22 tumors(84.6%) on both T1W and T2W images. Histologic analysis revealed that the tumor was composed of spindle cells and collagen bundles, with a variable amount of intermingled collagen surrounding the spindle cells. Nuclear atypia was not seen,and occasional mitoses were present in the tumor cells. CONCLUSION: The characteristic manifestations of CT or MR images of desmoid-type fibromatosis provide important evidence to discriminate benign and malignant soft tissue tumors."
"in this setting re-resection, adjuvant radiation or close clinical follow-up could all be appropriate options. We reviewed the current evidence for multimodality therapy of desmoids, with a focus on the importance of resection margins, and present our own algorithm for treatment."
"Desmoids are rare in the general population but occurs in between 10 to 20% of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). This risk is about 852 times the risk for the population at large. Desmoids are benign neoplasms that are capable of infiltrating locally with a high risk of recurrence (25-65%) even after extirpating surgery. Desmoids in FAP may occur extra-abdominally, or within the abdominal wall or most commonly intra-abdominally within the mesentery or retroperitoneal. Desmoids are a major problem in patients with FAP. Mortality from desmoids is high in such patients and ranges from 18 to 31%, compared to peri-ampullary carcinomas at about 22% and cancer in the retained rectum at only about 8%. Simple drug treatment with tamoxifen or NSAIDS like sulindac should be used as first line treatment as it carries a response in 30-50% of patients. Surgery should be reserved for extra-abdominal tumours alone and only when needed. Surgery for intra-abdominal desmoids should really only be attempted for intestinal obstruction or ureteric obstruction. Dacarbazine-Doxorubicin chemotherapy may have dramatic response in some cases. Genetic transfer may unlock this disease in future and may give patients with FAP and severe desmoids hope for the future."
"Desmoid tumour of the breast is a rare fibroblastic tumour whose spectrum ranges from being locally inert to aggressive and destructive, and represents 0.2% of all breast tumours. A 22-year-old woman, 2 years post-cosmetic augmentation mammoplasty with silicone implants, presented with a 6-month history of an enlarging mass in her left breast. Ultrasound showed a well-defined, hypoechoic mass arising within the muscles of the anterior chest, deep beneath the implant and not involving the underlying rib. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) showed features in keeping with changes associated with silicone implants. A provisional diagnosis of scarring and fibroblastic proliferation was made. The lesion was excised and the implant, noted to be intact, was exchanged. Immunochemistry showed strong positivity for vimentin and variable positivity for SMA and desmin, and patchy positivity for beta catenin. A final diagnosis of aggressive fibromatosis was made. Although the association of desmoid tumour and breast implants has been described, this case is unique as the FNA was highly suggestive of a silicone granuloma and the diagnosis of desmoid tumour was made on definitive pathology. The aetiology of desmoid tumours is reviewed and current treatment modalities discussed."

"Desmoid tumors are rare neoplasms accounting for 0.03% of all neoplasms and have an estimated incidence of 2 to 4 per million per year. World Health Organization currently refers to all of the deep types of fibromatosis as desmoid-type of fibromatoses. The term ""desmoid"" refers to the hard, tendon-like appearance of the tumor. The etiological factors suggested include genetic, endocrine and physical factors. About fifty percent of desmoid tumors arise in the abdominal region. The extra-abdominal desmoid tumors present a difficult problem in recognition and management especially because of the striking discrepancy between its deceptively harmless microscopic appearance and its potential to attain a large size, to recur, and to infiltrate neighboring tissues in the manner of a fibrosarcoma. Desmoid tumors are very rare in the oral cavity with less than 5% of cases constituting oral soft tissue fibromatosis. A 22-year old mentally retarded female patient with desmoid tumor occurring in the tongue is presented here."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is an invasive non-metastasizing soft-tissue tumor. Until recently, the standard treatment combined surgery and radiation therapy, but new studies reported that conservative strategies with or without medical treatment could be the best management. The aim of this study was to analyze and correlate the size and MR imaging signal features of aggressive fibromatosis with its behavior in order to choose the best treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 1985 and December 2005, 27 patients with at least 2 consecutive MRI examinations and no surgery or radiation therapy in between were recorded. There were 9 men and 18 women, and median age was 31 years. They underwent 107 MRI examinations of 47 lesions, 29 of which were medically treated, while the remaining 18 did not receive any drug administration. The size and signal changes of each lesion were studied over time on T2- and/or T1-weighted sequences after injection of contrast medium. RECIST criteria were used for size: only a 30% decrease or a 20% increase in the size of the main dimension was considered significant. We classified the appearance of the signal into six categories in order of increasing intensity and then we established the related variations over time. RESULTS: The size of 79% of the lesions in the treated group and 82% in the untreated group remained stable. The initial signal of stable lesions or those exhibiting an increase in size was most frequently high. There was a high rate of signal stability over time, whatever the initial signal and size changes. Changes in size were not correlated with the initial MR signal. A decrease in size associated with a decreased signal was observed in three cases exclusively in the treated group. CONCLUSION: Fibromatoses are a group of soft-tissue tumors with variable characteristics on MRI, but it is not possible to predict their behavior based on the MRI signal."
"Calcifying fibrous pseudotumor (CFT) is a rare distinct soft-tissue lesion characterized histologically by lymphoplasmacytic aggregates in a rich collagenized background with abundant psammomatous and dystrophic calcifications. Occurring most often in children and young adults, CFTs are clinically benign lesions that can form over a broad anatomic distribution, including in subcutaneous and deep soft tissues, as well as in serosal and visceral locations. The cause and mechanisms of pathogenesis of CFT are unknown. Simple excision with a margin of normal tissue is the treatment of choice. The risk for local recurrence is low. In this article, we describe a case of CFT in a 29-year-old woman with a 7-cm mass on the right upper gingiva and hard palate, discuss the differential diagnosis with other oral spindle cell lesions, such as, desmoid fibromatosis, nodular fasciitis, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, solitary fibrous tumor and also review the recent literature on this rare benign entity."
"Desmoid tumours, also termed aggressive fibromatosis, are rare soft tissue neoplasms derived from fascial or musculo-aponeurotic structures. These tumours are histologically benign, but may behave aggressively. Problems in management are encountered because of their potential to attain large sizes, recur, and infiltrate neighbouring vital structures. Wide excision with adequate margins is the treatment of choice. Adjuvant or rarely primary radiation has a defined role. We report a 37-year-old man with a large recurrent thoracic desmoid which attained a very large size."
"1) translocation leading to fusion proteins involving transcription factors or growth factors (Ewing sarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans); 2) tyrosine kinase receptor mutations (gastrointestinal stromal tumors); 3) tumor-suppressor gene deletion (type 1 neurofibromatosis, rhabdoid tumors); 4) genetic alteration such as amplification of chromosomal regions (well differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma); 5) sarcomas with more complex genetic alterations (leiomyosarcoma) and 6) abnormalities involving the cell-adhesion pathways (aggressive fibromatosis). Together with the current development of numerous targeted therapies, these recent progress are the basis of tomorrow's personalised medicine for patients with soft tissue sarcoma."

A rare case of isolated giant mesenteric fibromatosis is presented. The tumor originated from the fibrous mesenteric tissue. The patient underwent laparotomy because of abdominal discomfort and sub-occlusive symptoms due to the giant mass. Differential diagnosis of mesenteric masses is discussed and the Authors also review the literature concerning this rare disease.
"Nuclear immunoreactivity for beta-catenin is a useful adjunct for diagnosis of adult desmoid-type fibromatoses, many of which exhibit mutations within the APC/beta-catenin (Wnt) pathway. Pediatric fibromatoses represent a heterogeneous group of lesions that are diagnostically challenging, especially on biopsy. We studied beta-catenin expression in a variety of pediatric fibroblastic and myofibroblastic lesions. Immunohistochemical nuclear expression of beta-catenin was assessed in 100 tumors. High-level expression of beta-catenin was found in 42% of usual-type or deep fibromatoses (21 of 50). Such expression was not seen in any of the other lesions, including fibrous hamartoma of infancy (0 of 18), juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (0 of 7), infantile digital fibromatosis (0 of 6), myofibromatosis (0 of 5), lipofibromatosis (0 of 4), calcifying aponeurotic fibroma (0 of 3), palmar-plantar fibromatosis (0 of 2), fibromatosis colli (0 of 1), or torticollis (0 of 1). High-level beta-catenin staining is seen in deep ""adult-type"" fibromatoses occurring in children, although to a lesser frequency than in adult fibromatoses. This indicates that a subset of deep fibromatoses in childhood shares similar mechanisms of tumorigenesis with those in adults. beta-catenin is not expressed in other common pediatric fibroblastic and myofibroblastic lesions, and the Wnt pathway does not appear to play a role in their pathogenesis."
"Biallelic mutation of the ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS COLI (APC) gene is a hallmark of sporadic colorectal cancer and colorectal, duodenal and desmoid tumours that develop in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients. The mutations affecting both APC alleles are interdependent, the position of the first APC mutation determining where the second hit will occur. This results in a complex pattern of mutation distribution in the APC sequence that translates into the stabilization of beta-catenin that in turn feeds the affected cells with a permanent mitogenic signal. We describe here a new APC domain, the beta-catenin inhibitory domain (CID) of APC located between the second and third 20 amino acid repeats and therefore present in many truncated APC products found in human tumours. In truncated APC, the CID is absolutely necessary to down-regulate the transcriptional activity and the level of beta-catenin, even when an axin/conductin binding site is present. The activity of the CID is dramatically reduced in several colon cancer cell lines and can be inhibited by shorter truncated APC lacking the CID. The CID is a direct target of the selective pressure acting on APC during tumourigenesis. It explains the interdependence of both APC mutations, not only in colorectal but also in duodenal and desmoid tumours."
"41A (59%), 45F (33%), and 45P (8%, excluded from further analysis because of rarity). Five-year recurrence-free survival was significantly poorer in 45F-mutated desmoids (23%, P < 0.0001) versus either 41A (57%) or nonmutated tumors (65%). Nuclear beta-catenin expression was observed in 98% of specimens and intensity was inversely correlated with incidence of desmoid recurrence (P < 0.01). In conclusion, CTNNB1 mutations are highly common in desmoid tumors. Furthermore, patients harboring CTNNB1 (45F) mutations are at particular risk for recurrence and therefore may especially benefit from adjuvant therapeutic approaches."
"Constitutive activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is a hallmark of many cancers and has been associated with familial and sporadic desmoid tumors. The aim of the present study is to assess the therapeutic potential of oncolytic adenoviruses selectively replicating in cells in which the Wnt signaling pathway is active on primary cells from desmoid tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Primary cells extracted from familial (n = 3) or sporadic (n = 3) desmoid tumors were cultured short term. Cancer cell survival and viral replication were measured in vitro upon infection with two different oncolytic adenoviruses targeting a constitutive activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Adenoviral infectivity was also assessed. RESULTS: Although cells extracted from one sporadic desmoid tumor responded very well to the oncolytic action of the adenoviruses (<20% of viable cells upon infection at a multiplicity of infection of 10), cells from two tumor samples were totally resistant to the viral action. Cells from the remaining samples showed intermediate sensitivity to the oncolytic viruses. These effects were correlated to the level of infectivity of the cells. Finally, in responder cells, evidences of viral replication was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our experimental data suggest that the response of desmoid tumor cells to oncolytic adenovirus is neither correlated to the type of mutation activating the Wnt signaling pathway nor to the familial or sporadic nature of the tumor. In addition, they highlight the variability of infectivity of individual tumors and predict a great variability in the response to oncolytic adenoviruses."

"To find out the suitable therapy for the patient of desmoid tumour in head and neck. METHODS: Forty-four patients with desmoid tumours of the head and neck treated at Cancer Hospital of Fudan University between 1987 and 2002 were identified from inpatient tumour database. Patients were classified into three groups: operation group (15 cases); operation + radiation group (12 cases); radiation group (17 cases). All patients were prospectively followed. Clinicopathologic features and treatment modalities were evaluated. RESULTS: In the group of operation, four of operation group had recurrences 26.7% (4/15). In the group of radiation, three of radiation group had recurrences 17.6% (3/17). And the recurrence of operation + radiation group was 23.5% (4/17). No patient died of their disease. CONCLUSION: For desmoid tumors of the head neck, operation + radiation was recommended, and the benefits of radiation therapy were demonstrated."
"Numerous studies referring to conventional chemotherapy for aggressive fibromatosis with the use of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristin, vinblastine and other drugs have been published. Imatinib mesylate is a recently developed oral anticancer agent designed to selectively inhibit tyrosine kinases implicated in oncogenesis and it seems to represent a promising opportunity (also in first line) in the treatment of patients with advanced disease not candidate to prior surgery."
"Surgical treatment has been the mainstay for extremity and trunk desmoid tumors with a negative surgical margin. However, even when resection with a wide surgical margin is achieved, the local recurrence rate remains high. The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical outcome of patients with extremity and trunk desmoid tumors after surgical treatment and to determine the factors influencing local recurrence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 1991 and December 2003, 30 of 58 patients with desmoid tumors referred to our institutions and surgically treated and followed up for more than 2 years were selected for this study. Patient age, gender, tumor size, location, status of disease (primary or recurrent), and surgical margins were analyzed as possible risk factors for recurrence. RESULTS: Sixteen (53%) of the 30 patients had a local recurrence. Eight of the 19 patients (42.1%) with a negative surgical margin experienced a recurrence. Younger age (<30 years) was a significant risk factor for local recurrence (P < 0.05). Tumor size, surgical margin and previous surgical history were not associated with local recurrence. Younger age and female gender had a propensity for local recurrence, suggesting that the biological behavior of desmoid tumor may depend on the status of the disease at presentation. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that radical surgical treatment causing severe functional impairment should be avoided in selected cases on the basis of patient characteristics, and that other novel therapeutic tools may be necessary for patients in whom a higher risk of local recurrence is assumed or severe complications after surgical treatment are predicted."
"We describe here a three year-old girl with classic clinical and histological features of juvenile hyaline fibromatosis. We found a history of similar skin findings in her eldest sister, in whom the disorder took a rapidly progressive and fatal course in the second year of life, suggesting either a very severe form of juvenile hyaline fibromatosis, or the possibility of infantile systemic hyalinosis. The similarities and differences between these two described types of hyalinoses have been reviewed in reference to the present report."
"Rutherfurd syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is primarily characterised by the classical triad of gingival fibromatosis, delayed tooth eruption and corneal dystrophy. Associated features of the condition include abnormally shaped teeth, mental retardation and aggressive behaviour. CASE REPORT: His Consultant Clinical Geneticist referred a 2-year-old boy to the Dept. of Paediatric Dentistry at Manchester Dental Hospital. The child and his father had a diagnosis of Rutherfurd Syndrome; a rare autosomal-dominant condition featuring corneal dystrophy, gingival hypertrophy, abnormally shaped teeth and delayed eruption. The only erupted teeth were 52, 71 and 81. The patient also suffers from features of Marfan syndrome, a condition he has inherited from his mother. CLINICAL MANAGEMENT: Preventive advice was provided and the patient was placed on regular review. By the age of 4 years, 52, 61, 72, 71 and 81 were the only teeth present clinically. Maxillary and mandibular dentures were provided, which he refused to wear. FOLLOW-UP: At age 8 years, 31 and 41 were erupted lingual to the primary incisors. No other permanent teeth had erupted. Radiographs revealed failure of eruption of multiple primary and permanent teeth. The second premolars had formed above the unerupted mandibular primary second molars. The patient continued to refuse any intervention. Treatment options discussed included overdentures and /or removal of primary teeth and exposure of permanent teeth. CONCLUSION: This case has presented a rare syndrome with two important dental features, namely gingival hyperplasia and failure of eruption. The case has a long term follow up of 6 years and has a first time association to Marfan syndrome. It also highlights the importance of family history and how it can affect the attitude of the child towards dental treatment."
"Aggressive fibromatosis in children is a rare, benign condition that is locally infiltrative and destructive. It often presents as a rapidly growing, painless lump in the head and neck region. To date, only small series and case reports have been reported, and the management of the condition remains unclear. Recently, nuclear beta-catenin expression has been suggested as a tumor-specific marker for aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid). AIM: The aims of the study were to review our experience of the presentation, management, and treatment outcome of pediatric aggressive fibromatosis in the head and neck and to identify the presence of the desmoid tumor marker beta-catenin within this population. METHOD: The study was conducted as a retrospective case review of children diagnosed with aggressive fibromatosis in the head and neck for a period of 20 years and a review of the literature. Pathologic review of the original tumor specimens was undertaken for evidence of positive tumor margins and presence of nuclear beta-catenin expression. RESULTS: A total of 10 patients (6 males, 4 females) were identified. The age at presentation ranged from 12 months to 14 years. In total, 8 patients were treated with surgery alone. This included 7 patients with extension of the tumor to the resection margin; all had good long-term outcomes with no disease progression. Two patients received chemoradiotherapy, one as primary treatment, and the other as adjuvant treatment after gross incomplete resection. Both resulted in poor outcomes requiring further treatments. Within our series of pediatric fibromatosis, only 4 cases (40%) had positive results for any nuclear beta-catenin expression, and 6 (60%) of 10 patients had negative results for beta-catenin. CONCLUSION: Our experience is that total gross resection and preservation of form and function is of higher priority than achieving a negative resection margin. Pediatric fibromatosis though aggressive is still a benign condition, and careful thought should be taken before considering adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Nuclear beta-catenin expression should not be considered a specific tumor marker for pediatric aggressive fibromatosis of the head and neck. Pediatric aggressive fibromatosis in this region may be a distinct subtype of desmoid tumor from its adult form."

"The management of desmoid tumours, previously based on strategies employed for sarcomas, should be reassessed, given the morbidity of interventions used in their treatment. METHODS: Long-term follow-up (median 123 months) of a series of 106 treated patients with 69 primary and 37 recurrent desmoids, in order to study natural history and outcome. RESULTS: Desmoids typically evolved actively over a median period of 3 years, and stabilised thereafter. Recurrences or progression most commonly occurred between 14 and 17 months. Risk factors for recurrence were presentation (primary vs. recurrent), gender, tumour location and resection margins. However, survival was independent from these factors, with equivalent survival whether resection had been performed or not. Tumour control and functional outcome depended on location and presentation. Functional impairment was proportional to number of operations and whether patients had received radiotherapy. Recurrences were observed in 12/23 patients after radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Desmoids are relatively indolent tumours needing different approaches than sarcomas. Direct surgery is advisable only in primary lower trunk wall/girdle locations. Wait-and-see and medical treatment is preferable in other types of presentations."
"Fibromatosis colli is the most common cause of congenital torticollis. Patients show a solid tumor in the region of the sternocleidomastoid muscle which has to be differentiated from other congenital space-occupying lesions in the cervical region. PATIENTS AND METHOD: 13 infants (7 boys, 6 girls) with a mean age of 28 +/- 21 days with fibromatosis colli were examined with a high-resolution linear transducer via color-coded duplex sonography. The location of the tumor within the sternocleidomastoid muscle, delineation from surrounding structures, the echogenicity, and the vascularization were estimated. 3 tumors were surgically removed, and the other 10 infants were treated conservatively with physiotherapy. RESULTS: The tumors were located on the right side in 10 patients and on the left side in 3 infants. In 10 patients the tumor was located in the caudal part, in 3 in the middle part of muscle. All tumors showed a good delineation from the surrounding structures. The volume of the tumor was 5.4 +/- 2.7 ml. 8 tumors showed inhomogeneous echogenicity, and 5 showed homogenous echogenicity. 9 tumors had echopoor, 3 echogenic, 1 isoechogenic internal echoes compared to the contralateral healthy muscle. 13 tumors showed increased perfusion (10 diffusely, 3 focally) via color-coded Doppler sonography. CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of fibromatosis colli can be affirmed sonographically. The tumors are commonly located in the distal 2 / 3 of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and show good delineation from surrounding structures. Typically an inhomogeneous, echopoor tumor with increased perfusion can be shown. Additional diagnostic imaging modalities are usually not necessary. The treatment of choice is physiotherapy. In special cases with a lack of improvement, surgery is necessary."
"Gardner's Syndrome is a familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) syndrome that presents with colorectal polyps, craniofacial osteomas, lipomas, epidermoid cysts, and ampullary cancers. These patients are at significant risk for developing desmoid tumors, which are locally infiltrating fibromatous lesions. These are most commonly found in the abdominal cavity, but may be extra-abdominal. Although FAP-associated desmoid tumors often occur at sites of surgical scarring, this is the first report following resection of an intracranial meningioma. CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a patient with Gardner's Syndrome who underwent resection of a foramen magnum meningioma and subsequently developed a de novo desmoid tumor at the surgical site. She had a complete surgical resection of the tumor but did not receive adjuvant therapy. At the time of her death 7 years after her desmoid tumor resection, she had no evidence of a recurrence at the skull base. CONCLUSION: This case report emphasizes the need for careful follow-up in patients with Gardner's Syndrome who undergo resection of a meningioma or other neurosurgical procedure. Adjuvant therapy may be of value in these patients."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (syn. desmoid tumor) is a sporadically occurring neoplastic proliferation of fibroblasts originating from musculoaponeurotic planes, forming invasively growing masses without the capability to metastasize. The choice of treatment remains surgical resection with or without radiotherapy, and is characterized by high recurrence rates. Better understanding of the aetiology of aggressive fibromatosis is needed to be able to develop new treatment strategies to cope with the high recurrence rates. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified through a search of the electronic databases PubMed/ Medline. The following search terms were used: 'aggressive fibromatosis', 'desmoid tumor', 'adenomatous polyposis coli', 'APC', 'beta-catenin', 'Wnt', 'Wingless' and 'Wnt/Wingless'. Studies were selected for review on the basis of abstract reading. A hand search was performed by checking reference lists in selected articles. RESULTS: The neoplastic nature of aggressive fibromatosis and the role of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and beta-catenin signaling cascade in driving the onset and progression of this disease are discussed. CONCLUSION: Mutations in either the APC or beta-catenin genes are likely to be a major driving force in the formation of these desmoid tumors. More research is needed to develop new treatment strategies."
"The objective of this retrospective study was to compare the diagnostic value of 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D: -glucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET)/CT versus (18)F-FDG PET and CT alone for staging and restaging of pediatric solid tumors. METHODS: Forty-three children and adolescents (19 females and 24 males; mean age, 15.2 years; age range, 6-20 years) with osteosarcoma (n = 1), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 1), synovial sarcoma (n = 2), germ cell tumor (n = 2), neuroblastoma (n = 2), desmoid tumor (n = 2), melanoma (n = 3), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 5), Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 7), non-Hodgkin-lymphoma (n = 9), and Ewing's sarcoma (n = 9) who had undergone (18)F-FDG PET/CT imaging for primary staging or follow-up of metastases were included in this study. The presence, location, and size of primary tumors was determined separately for PET/CT, PET, and CT by two experienced reviewers. The diagnosis of the primary tumor was confirmed by histopathology. The presence or absence of metastases was confirmed by histopathology (n = 62) or clinical and imaging follow-up (n = 238). RESULTS: The sensitivities for the detection of solid primary tumors using integrated (18)F-FDG PET/CT (95%), (18)F-FDG PET alone (73%), and CT alone (93%) were not significantly different (p > 0.05). Seventeen patients showed a total of 153 distant metastases. Integrated PET/CT had a significantly higher sensitivity for the detection of these metastases (91%) than PET alone (37%; p < 0.05), but not CT alone (83%; p > 0.05). When lesions with a diameter of less than 0.5 cm were excluded, PET/CT (89%) showed a significantly higher specificity compared to PET (45%; p < 0.05) and CT (55%; p < 0.05). In a sub-analysis of pulmonary metastases, the values for sensitivity and specificity were 90%, 14%, 82% and 63%, 78%, 65%, respectively, for integrated PET/CT, stand-alone PET, and stand-alone CT. For the detection of regional lymph node metastases, (18)F-FDG PET/CT, (18)F-FDG PET alone, and CT alone were diagnostically correct in 83%, 61%, and 42%. A sub-analysis focusing on the ability of PET/CT, PET, and CT to detect osseous metastases showed no statistically significant difference between the three imaging modalities (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study showed a significantly increased sensitivity of PET/CT over that of PET for the detection of distant metastases but not over that of CT alone. However, the specificity of PET/CT for the characterization of pulmonary metastases with a diameter > 0.5 cm and lymph node metastases with a diameter of <1 cm was significantly increased over that of CT alone."
"Desmoid tumors (desmoid-type fibromatoses) are locally aggressive soft tissue tumors associated with the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway (APC-beta-catenin-Tcf pathway). Matrix metalloproteinase-7, which is one of the target genes of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, has been reported to play an important role in tumor progression. We examined the immunohistochemical expression of beta-catenin and matrix metalloproteinase-7 in 72 samples (63 primary and 9 recurrent samples, 63 patients) of sporadic desmoid tumors without familial adenomatous polyposis, and the genetic alteration of the beta-catenin gene in 33 frozen materials (22 primary and 11 recurrent samples, 22 patients). We further examined messenger RNA expression of matrix metalloproteinase 7 by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and compared the results with those of normal skeletal muscles. Immunohistochemically, there was a statistically significant correlation between widespread nuclear expression of beta-catenin and overexpression of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (P < .01 in extra-abdominal desmoid, Fisher test). There were 7 missense point mutations in the 22 primary frozen samples (32%). In the beta-catenin mutated group, matrix metalloproteinase-7 messenger RNA expression was significantly higher than that of the beta-catenin wild-type group (P = .0018, Mann-Whitney U test). Our results suggest that the matrix metalloproteinase-7 gene may be up-regulated by mutated or continuously elevated beta-catenin protein and that the matrix metalloproteinase-7 gene may also be targeted in the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in sporadic desmoid tumors."
"Desmoid tumours are rare neoplasms characterised by clonal proliferation of myofibroblasts that do not metastasise, but often exhibit an infiltrative pattern and functional impairment. When desmoids arise in the intestinal mesentery, surgical resection is seldom possible without life-altering loss of intestinal function. METHODS: Retrospective review of the clinical management of 52 consecutive patients treated for desmoids of the intestinal mesentery from January 2001 to August 2006. A multidisciplinary treatment plan was developed based on primary disease extent, tumour behaviour and resectability. Patients with stable but unresectable disease were observed without treatment. Patients with resectable disease underwent surgery, and patients with unresectable progressing disease received chemotherapy, most commonly liposomal doxorubicin, followed by surgery if chemotherapy rendered the disease resectable. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 50.0 months (range 4.6-212), 50 patients (96%) have either no recurrence or radiographically stable disease. No patient requires total parenteral nutrition. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that the extent of disease; tumour behaviour and resectability are the important factors when defining a treatment plan for mesenteric desmoid tumours. A multidisciplinary approach of surgery combined with chemotherapy is an effective and function-sparing strategy for managing this disease."
"a TCAA deletion at codon 1068 and a deletion of a codon at bp 1192-2097. In tumor B, a somatic mutation was found at codon 1041 changing CAA to TAA. We could not detect any somatic mutations in tumor C. We conclude that somatic mutation analysis of the APC gene can be used to identify whether a recurrent desmoid tumor in a patient with FAP is a new primary tumor or a recurrence from microscopic remnants of the original tumor."
"Peptide receptors are frequently overexpressed in human tumors, allowing receptor-targeted scintigraphic imaging and therapy with radiolabeled peptide analogues. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptors are new candidates for these applications, based on their high expression in specific cancers. Because NPY receptors are expressed in selected sarcoma cell lines and because novel treatment options are needed for sarcomas, this study assessed the NPY receptor in primary human sarcomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumor tissues of 88 cases, including Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT), synovial sarcomas, osteosarcomas, chondrosarcomas, liposarcomas, angiosarcomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, leiomyosarcomas, and desmoid tumors, were investigated for NPY receptor protein with in vitro receptor autoradiography using (125)I-labeled NPY receptor ligands and for NPY receptor mRNA expression with in situ hybridization. RESULTS: ESFT expressed the NPY receptor subtype Y1 on tumor cells in remarkably high incidence (84%) and density (mean, 5,314 dpm/mg tissue). Likewise, synovial sarcomas expressed Y1 on tumor cells in high density (mean, 7,497 dpm/mg; incidence, 40%). The remaining tumors expressed NPY receptor subtypes Y1 or Y2 at lower levels. Moreover, many of the sarcomas showed Y1 expression on intratumoral blood vessels. In situ hybridization for Y1 mRNA confirmed the autoradiography results. CONCLUSIONS: NPY receptors are novel molecular markers for human sarcomas. Y1 may inhibit growth of specific sarcomas, as previously shown in an in vivo mouse model of human ESFT. The high Y1 expression on tumor cells of ESFT and synovial sarcomas and on blood vessels in many other sarcomas represents an attractive basis for an in vivo tumor targeting."
"Desmoid tumor of the breast is an extremely rare condition. It is difficult to provide a correct preoperative diagnosis of desmoid tumor of the breast because of its tendency to mimic breast carcinoma on physical examination and conventional imaging such as mammography and sonography. We present a case of desmoid tumor of the breast that mimicked breast carcinoma, in which proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy assisted the result of biopsy, thus enabling a correct preoperative diagnosis."
"Primary sarcomas in the ischiorectal fossa are occasionally reported and represent a significant challenge due to the proximity of rectum, levator muscles and pudendal neurovascular structures. We report a case in which the diagnosis changed between biopsy (desmoid tumour) and resection (malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour), requiring a multidisciplinary surgical approach involving different sub-specialties. It also illustrates the importance of undertaking sarcoma surgery in a recognized sarcoma centre with sarcoma expertise available across a range of disciplines."
"Extraabdominal fibromatosis or desmoid tumor (DT) is a slow growing locally aggressive soft tissue tumor that can occur anywhere in the body. We report the aspiration biopsy cytology features of a case of DT of the right neck area in a 35-year-old man who had a long standing history of tumoral calcinosis. The aspirate was interpreted as ""benign spindle cell lesion"" and confirmed as DT on histologic examination of the resected mass. We discuss the possible differential diagnoses of other benign or malignant lesions on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy and especially discuss the aspiration cytology features of DT compared with those of tumoral calcinosis. We also discuss the value of immunohistochemical markers that help in differentiating DT from other entities."
"This work presents clinical evolution and functional outcome of patients with histologic diagnosis of Muscle-aponeurotic aggressive fibromatosis in 10 years of follow up in the National Rehabilitation Institute. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a descriptive, retrospective, cross sectioned clinical trial in the Bone Tumour Department. We reviewed the clinical and radiological files from 1996 to 2006. INCLUSION CRITERIA: both genres, any age, clinical and histological diagnosis. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: incomplete file, lost to follow up, other diagnosis. Elimination criteria: Death during trial period. Analyzed variables. Age, genre, occupation, birth place, school degree, anatomic situation, signs and symptoms, time of follow up, treatment, relapses. We used statistical computed system Excel 2007, with central trend descriptive variables. RESULTS: Eleven patients (mean age 24.36; SD 18.32, 1-61 years), 9 female (81.8%) 2 male; birth place: Mexico City 7 (63.63%), Puebla 1, Toluca 1, South Baja California 1 and Chiapas 1. Anatomic situation: Pelvis 6 (54.54%), thoracic and gluteus 3. Pain and presence of a mass 10 (90.9%), range of motion limitation 5, edema and erithema 1. Relapses 6 (55%). TREATMENT: broad resection 3 patients, marginal resection 6 patients, radical resection 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: If clinical suspicion of Muscle-aponeurotic fibromatosis appears, one should start protocol work up: laboratory, radiographic assessment, nuclear medicine, biopsy and histologic and immune-histochemistry. One should perform broad resections aiming to preserve the most possible extremity tissue disease free."
"Desmoplastic small round-cell tumors are a rare malignant tumor that affects male children and young adults. It frequently presents as a large abdominal mass with widespread peritoneal involvement at diagnosis. We report two cases of desmoplastic small round-cell tumors, with diffuse infiltration in the abdomen and pelvis in two adult caucasian males. The first case-report is a middle-aged man and the second a young adult man with early recurrence and diffuse metastatic lymph nodes. Both tumors have a distinct morphology, a polyphenotypic differentiation and a t(11;22) (p13;q12) translocation. The prognosis remains poor and leads to death in most cases, despite surgical resection, radiotherapy and high-dose chemotherapy."
"To explore the role of abnormalities of chromosome 8, APC and beta-catenin genes in tumorigenesis of aggressive fibromatosis. METHODS: Trisomy 8 was detected by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The APC gene and beta-catenin gene mutations were detected by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and direct sequence analysis after the PCR transition. RESULTS: The rate of trisomy 8 in recurrent tumors (62.5%, 5/8) was significantly higher than that in the primary tumors (8.3%, 1/12). Somatic substitution of APC gene was found in 18 of 69 (26.1%) aggressive fibrometases. Somatic transition of beta-catenin gene was detected in 13 of 69 (18.8%) and mutation at codon 41 in exon 3 involving threonine residues implicated in the degradation of beta-catenin. The abnormal expression of beta-catenin had no significant correlation with the mutation of APC or beta-catenin gene. The group with positively expressed beta-catenin protein showed a significant higher c-myc protein expression than those without (P = 0.001). The Ki-67 index was extremely low in all the lesions. The apoptosis index (AI) of the groups with positively expressed c-myc and cyclin D1 showed significantly lower AI than those without. CONCLUSION: Trisomy 8 may serve as a useful predictor of recurrence in aggressive fibromatosis. There are somatic mutations of the APC and beta-catenin genes in the aggressive fibromatosis, and there are abnormalities in the Wnt signaling pathway. These abnormalities may result in the aberrances of cell proliferation and apoptosis, which are likely to be import factors in the tumorigenesis."
"We present a rare case of recurrent aggressive fibromatosis of the maxilla in a 61-year-old woman, who was treated by resection of the left maxilla. Adjuvant treatments, particularly radiotherapy, are valuable if the tumour recurs."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumor) is a very rare neoplasm arising from the musculoaponeurotic structures. It is characterized by locally aggressive growth, and a tendency to relapse but not to metastasize. We report on a young woman with a large desmoid tumor of the left foot. Multiple operations and radiotherapy had resulted in local recurrences. Long-term immunointervention with pegylated interferon alfa-2b, however, led to marked clinical improvement of the patient's condition and a radiologically proven stabilization of the disease."
"The term fibromatosis indicates a proliferation of well-differentiated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts that develops in the soft tissue. This tumor has been considered locally aggressive because of the infiltrative growth pattern, but does not metastasize. Its occurrence in the head and neck region is not common, and very sporadically it may occur in the oral cavity or jaw bones. Two cases of adult fibromatosis are described here; one involving the submucosa of the middle hard palate and the other the subcutaneous area of the frontal bone. Tumor growth was rapid and bone involvement occurred in one case. Biopsies were taken and in both cases histological examination showed a tumor consisting of fibroblasts within a collagenous stroma, with rare atypia and mitoses. The patients underwent surgical resection with wide surgical margins; excised material was analyzed microscopically and a diagnosis of fibromatosis was rendered. Immunohistochemistry was positive for actin, vimentin and desmin, and negative for S-100, CD34, the progesterone receptors (PR)-A and PR-B and the estrogen receptors (ER)alpha and ERbeta. Follow-up at 5 years after surgery found both patients to be progression free. The clinical, histological and immunohistochemical features were analyzed to better characterize this form of the disease, that very rarely involves the oral cavity."
"We reviewed four patients diagnosed with a cortical desmoid lesion at the distal posterior medial femur. Each case reflects a clinical scenario that can be present. Cortical desmoid is a benign, self-limited entity which occasionally can exhibit aggressive radiologic features. Here, we present the specific imaging features in association with patients history and clinical findings facilitating establishment of correct diagnosis. Exact diagnosis is important in order to avoid unnecessary biopsy and complicated therapeutic strategies."
"Cranial fasciitis, an unusual fibroproliferative lesion that occurs in the scalp of infants, is considered a posttraumatic reactive process similar to nodular fasciitis. Its pathobiology has not been investigated. Over the last 15 years, we diagnosed cranial fasciitis in six children; in one case, the lesion recurred after 4 years. This lesion and two others showed aberrant, diffuse nuclear reactivity for beta-catenin. One of the lesions with aberrant nuclear beta-catenin occurred in a child with a history of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and a germline frameshift adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutation, c.878delG. The other APC allele in this tumor showed an acquired nonsense mutation, c.4132C --> T. Both these mutations lead to translation of a truncated APC protein. The other two cases of cranial fasciitis with aberrant nuclear beta-catenin occurred sporadically. One of these showed a point mutation, c.122C --> T, in exon 3 of CTNNB1. This mutation causes replacement of threonine with isoleucine at codon 41, leading to loss of a phosphorylation site in the beta-catenin protein. The third case with nuclear beta-catenin staining was the single one that showed recurrence. This tumor did not show mutations in exon 3 of CTNNB1 or in exons 8/9/16 of APC. The results of this small study indicate a dysregulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in a subset of cranial fasciitis, suggesting that this subset is pathobiologically related to desmoid fibromatoses rather than to nodular fasciitis. Occasional cases of cranial fasciitis may be associated with FAP and serve as an early indicator of this disease, information that would be important in the early diagnosis of FAP in patients without a family history of polyposis."
"Desmoid tumours (DTs) are the primary cause of death of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) following restorative proctocolectomy. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for DT in a French population. METHODS: Clinical data for 442 patients with FAP from 1983 to 2004 were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 124 DTs were documented in 50 patients (25 female). DT sites were mesenteric (73 tumours), abdominal wall (44) and extra-abdominal (seven). Female patients developed DT earlier than males. Although DTs appeared after colectomy in 34 patients, the type of surgery did not influence the risk of DT. An identified point mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene after codon 1444 was a significant risk factor (hazard ratio 3.3 (95 per cent confidence interval 1.5 to 7.3)). Belonging to a family affected by DT did not increase the individual's risk in this population. CONCLUSION: No risk factor for life-threatening mesenteric DT could meaningfully modify the management of patients with FAP."
"Desmoid fibromatoses are benign, slow growing fibroblastic neoplasms, arising from musculoaponeurotic stromal elements. Desmoids are characterized by local invasion, with a high rate of local recurrence and a tendency to destroy adjacent structures and organs. Desmoid fibromatoses are rare in children, and though they may occur in the head and neck region, are extremely rare in the paranasal sinuses. Here we report a case of extraabdominal desmoid fibromatosis in a seven-year-old boy involving the sphenoid sinus, one of only six published reports of desmoid fibromatosis of the paranasal sinuses. The expansile soft tissue mass eroded the walls of the sphenoid sinus as well as the posterior ethmoid air cells extending cephalad through the base of the skull. We discuss the clinicopathologic features of this lesion, including structural and ultrastructural characteristics, and we review the literature regarding treatment and outcome."

"Extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) has been shown to stimulate fibroblasts to production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMPs comprise a family of proteolytic enzymes implicated in the degradation of extracellular matrix which has been proposed to be one of the essential steps in tumor invasion and metastases. In the present study we investigated the expression and location of mRNAs for EMMPRIN, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) in mesenchymal tumors with different tendencies to recur or metastasize. SUBJECTS: Eight malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFH), seven aggressive fibromatosis (AF), and six benign fibrous tumors (BF). METHOD: The mRNA-expression of EMMPRIN, MMP-2 and MT1-MMP were studied using mRNA in situ hybridization technique. RESULTS: The mRNA-expression of EMMPRIN, MMP-2 and MT1-MMP respectively were found at varying frequency and level in all tumor types. The mRNAs corresponding to EMMPRIN and MMP-2 were seen in neoplastic cells as well as in endothelial cells both inside and outside the tumor pseudo-capsule, whereas MT1-MMP was seen only within the tumors. The estimated mRNA levels of EMMPRIN and MMP-2 covariated significantly. Overall, the highest expression was found in the MFH tumors and the lowest levels in the BF tumors. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that the MMP-inducer EMMPRIN and the extracellular matrix degrading system involving the metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MT1-MMP is frequently activated in mesenchymal tumors. The covariation between EMMPRIN and MMP-2 support previous findings that EMMPRIN may be an inducer of MMP-2. The high levels of MMP-2 mRNA in MFH indicate a relationship between the proteolytic activity of MMP-2 and the tumor aggressiveness."
"To define the efficacy of postoperative irradiation in patients with recurrent extra-abdominal desmoid tumors in whom surgical intervention has resulted in microscopically or grossly positive surgical margins. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients referred to the department of radiation oncology at the Detroit Medical Center with a diagnosis of recurrent extra-abdominal desmoid tumor. This analysis includes all patients seen from 1 January 1990 through 31 December 1999. A total of 11 patients were treated to 13 sites. Ten had microscopically positive margins and three had gross residual disease. Three patients were noted to have multifocal disease at the time of initial representation. Local control, survival, follow-up, and subsequent development of new tumors are measured from the last day of treatment with irradiation. RESULTS: Thirteen sites were treated. Seven patients had received chemotherapy/hormonal therapy prior to surgery and/or irradiation. The most commonly used drug was tamoxifen (n=6). The type of radiation delivered included external beam irradiation alone (n=3), combined external beam irradiation and brachytherapy (n=4), brachytherapy alone (n=3) and 252-Cf neutron brachytherapy alone (n=3). Follow-up has ranged from 29 to 115 months (median=76 months). Three patients have failed locally at 17, 24 and 29 months. One of these was treated for gross residual disease. No patient has died of tumor-related causes. Salvage at the failed sites was possible in twom of three with re-irradiation using external neutrons and/or aggressive surgical intervention and systemic therapy. Complications were most often noted to include decrease range in motion, especially in joint areas, and skin reactions which were normal in presentation. In one site there was development soft tissue necrosis. CONCLUSION: Based on our experience we recommend postoperative irradiation for all recurrent extra-abdominal desmoid lesions with microscopically or grossly positive surgical margins. Furthermore, patients with recurrent desmoid tumors involving the bony structures of the hand or feet are poor candidates for brachytherapy alone. For patients with extremity lesions, brachytherapy may be a reasonable treatment option provided adequate margins around the tumor bed are covered. The continued recommended use of irradiation in this group of patients is warranted."
"Purpose. Deep fibromatoses are large, often rapidly growing but benign soft tissue tumours. Although surgery is the mainstay of treatment, in unremitting and aggressive cases the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy may produce objective tumour responses. Fresh tumour samples from four patients with fibromatosis were investigated as part of a study of drug resistance in soft tissue tumours.Methods. Following short-term culture of fibromatosis cells in vitro , chemosensitivity to 4-hydroperoxy-ifosfamide, the active form of ifosfamide and doxorubicin was tested. Following 72-h continuous exposure to each drug, surviving cell fraction was assessed using the lactate dehydrogenase assay.Results. Mean IC(50) values for ifosfamide and doxorubicin were 6.2 and 0.35 micromol/l, respectively. In samples of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) from the same study the mean IC(50) values for ifosfamide and doxorubicin were 14.8 and 1.69 micromol. The difference in mean ifosfamide IC(50) values for fibromatosis and STS samples was statistically significant.Discussion. We are not aware of any other report suggesting the use of ifosfamide in this condition. These observations suggest that, for patients with inoperable or progressive lesions of fibromatosis causing significant morbidity, it may be valuable to include ifosfamide in experimental treatment regimens."
"Purpose. Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) is an uncommon locally infiltrating benign disease of soft tissue for which treatment comprises complete surgical resection. Radiotherapy can be given postoperatively if the margin is incompletely resected. If the tumour is inoperable radiotherapy provides an alternative treatment. Hormone therapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy have also been used for unresectable or recurrent disease. All treatment modalities carry an associated morbidity. We believe that the natural history of aggressive fibromatosis may include a period of stable disease without progression, during which time, treatment is not always necessary.Patients and methods. We present a retrospective review of 42 patients referred to the Royal Marsden Hospital between 1988 and 1995 with aggressive fibromatosis. Evidence of periods of stable disease and the relationship to delivered treatment was obtained from the case notes, including the natural history prior to referral to our institution. Stable disease was defined as a period of no objective progression for 6 months or longer.Results. Seventeen patients could be assessed for stable disease and all (100%) experienced at least one episode of stable disease, eight of whom whilst receiving hormonal or cytotoxic therapy. Of the 23 patients who could not be assessed for stable disease, as they underwent surgery at presentation or recurrence of disease, only 2 had persisting disease at last follow-up. Both of these patients had had positive surgical resection margins.Discussion. This study demonstrates the variable natural history of AF, which can include a substantial period of stable disease in a significant number of patients. A less aggressive approach to the management of AF may therefore be appropriate, particularly if a subgroup of patients who are likely to experience a period of stable disease can be identified."
"The chest wall is the most common extraabdominal site for desmoid tumors. However, true intrathoracic desmoid tumors are exceedingly rare with most cases actually representing intrathoracic extension of chest wall tumors. A comprehensive review of the literature was undertaken to identify the prevalence and characteristics of true intrathoracic desmoid tumors. METHODS: A case of surgical treatment of a true intrapleural desmoid tumor in a 42-year-old woman is reported. A comprehensive MEDLINE search was performed to identify all previously reported cases of intrathoracic desmoid tumor. RESULTS: Twenty-two reported cases of true intrathoracic desmoid tumor were identified including the case presented in this report. Of these, 12 were intrapleural in origin. Patient age ranged from 5 to 66 years. Average tumor size was 9.2 cm. All patients underwent surgical resection with negative margins in two-thirds. Twenty-five percent of those patients developed local recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike superficial chest wall desmoid tumors which will create a palpable mass, intrapleural tumors will not cause symptoms until they grow large enough to locally invade chest wall or surrounding structures or compress pulmonary parenchyma. Wide local excision (as is generally recommended for most desmoid tumors) is often impossible because of surrounding vascular and neural structures. Therefore, it may be advisable to consider adjuvant therapy, either radiation directed at known positive margins or antiestrogen therapy."
"This article gives a brief overview of the common histologic subtypes seen in truncal sarcomas and discusses fundamental diagnostic and treatment principles. It also provides a general review of abdominal desmoids. For both truncal sarcomas and desmoids, recurrence rates are high, and definitive recommendations regarding optimal treating are lacking. A multidisciplinary approach to these entities therefore is critical to select appropriate therapeutic strategies for individual patients."
"Breast fibromatosis (BF) is a rare benign pathological entity. Its etiology is unknown, but it has been associated with surgical trauma and certain genetic disorders. CLINICAL CASES: Case 1. The patient was a 17-year-old female with a 20 x 15 cm firm and fixed mass in the right breast. A core-needle biopsy was taken with a pathology report of a phyllodes tumor. Mammography revealed a well-differentiated lesion with no evidence of muscle invasion. The patient underwent wide surgical resection with thoracotomy and chest wall resection of the affected ribs. Pathology reported a 19 x 18 x 9 cm BF with a positive surgical margin. Oral colchicine was administered and at 3 months of follow-up the patient is disease free. CASE 2. The patient was a 49-year-old female with a 7 x 5 cm solid right breast mass located at the medial-upper quadrant and fixed to the pectoralis major muscle. Mammography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass infiltrating thoracic muscles. Wide surgical resection was performed with immediate latissimus dorsi reconstruction. Pathology report showed a BF with muscle invasion. At 3 months postsurgery, the patient is disease free. CONCLUSIONS: BF is a rare entity with a locally aggressive behavior. The infiltrative nature of this disease is associated with a tendency to recur locally. Its clinical and imaging features can mimic breast cancer. Differential diagnosis should be made before attempting treatment. The standard therapeutic modality is wide surgical resection, and radiotherapy is reserved for some cases with positive surgical margins."

"Desmoid tumours are uncommon. They are locally invasive and incomplete excision leads to recurrence, which can pose a significant management challenge. Patients therefore require effective treatment, which essentially entails tumour excision with a clear surgical margin. The resulting wide defect may lead to difficulty in closure of the anterior abdominal wall. We report our experience in treating large desmoid tumours of the anterior abdominal wall. Between January 2000 and December 2001, three patients with large desmoid tumour of the anterior abdominal wall were treated with wide excision, which included a 3-cm margin of uninvolved tissues. This led to a considerable abdominal wall defect. The peritoneal defect was closed as a separate layer, though under considerable tension, while the abdominal wall musculature defect was closed with a polypropylene mesh. All three patients recovered well with no immediate or late postoperative morbidity. Follow-up until December 2006 has not revealed any tumour recurrence or hernia development. Wide excision of an anterior abdominal wall desmoid tumour with a clear margin of 3 cm including the peritoneum should be considered when managing such tumours. Closure under tension of the peritoneum did not seem to produce any morbidity."

"A variety of benign and malignant masses can be found in the inguinal canal (IC). Benign causes of masses in the IC include spermatic cord lipoma, hematoma, abscess, neurofibroma, varicocele, desmoid tumor, air, bowel contrast material, hydrocele, and prostheses. Primary neoplasms of the IC include liposarcoma, Burkitt lymphoma, testicular carcinoma, and sarcoma. Metastases to the IC can occur from alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, monophasic sarcoma, prostate cancer, Wilms tumor, carcinoid tumor, melanoma, or pancreatic cancer. In patients with a known malignancy and peritoneal carcinomatosis, the diagnosis of metastases can be suggested when a mass is detected in the IC. When peritoneal disease is not evident, a mass in the IC is indicative of stage IV disease and may significantly alter clinical and surgical treatment of the patient. A combination of the clinical history, symptoms, laboratory values, and radiologic features aids the radiologist in accurately diagnosing mass lesions of the IC.

"Desmoid tumors are rare, benign soft tissue tumors, characterized by the proliferation of fibroblasts in an abundant collagen extra-cellular matrix. Intra-abdominal forms involve the mesentery and retroperitoneum and usually occur associated with familial adenomatous polyposis or Gardner's syndrome. Sporadic cases are more uncommon. Although desmoid tumors do not metastasize, their evolution can be life-threatening due to aggressive local invasion, such as mesentery involvement. CASE REPORT: We herein report a very rare location of sporadic desmoid tumors involving the pancreatic tail, presenting as a cystic lesion. A 51-year-old woman presented with recurrent abdominal pain and weight loss. The diagnosis of mucinous cystadenocarcinoma was suspected preoperatively and the patient underwent a splenopancreatectomy with en-bloc resection of the left colonic flexure, duodenojejunal junction and part of the posterior gastric wall. Pathological analysis revealed fibroblastic proliferation arising in musculoaponeurotic structures consistent with a desmoid tumor. The diagnosis was confirmed by immunocytochemical analysis and the assessment of the beta-catenin gene mutation. Perioperative examination reported gastric and small-bowel invasion. No treatment was given postoperatively to prevent desmoid tumor recurrence. After a 1-year follow-up, no recurrence was observed. CONCLUSION: Desmoid tumors are very rare in the pancreas and their diagnosis can be difficult, such as in our case where it presented as a cystic lesion. In contrast to intra-abdominal forms, sporadic pancreatic desmoid tumors are more frequent than those associated with familial adenomatous polyposis."

"The heterogeneity that soft tissue sarcomas (STS) exhibit in their clinical behavior, even within histological subtypes, complicates patient care. Histological appearance is determined by gene expression. Morphologic features are generally good predictors of biologic behavior, however, metastatic propensity, tumor growth, and response to chemotherapy may be determined by gene expression patterns that do not correlate well with morphology. One approach to identify heterogeneity is to search for genetic markers that correlate with differences in tumor behavior. Alternatively, subsets may be identified based on gene expression patterns alone, independent of knowledge of clinical outcome. We have reported gene expression patterns that distinguish two subgroups of clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC), and other gene expression patterns that distinguish heterogeneity of serous ovarian carcinoma (OVCA) and aggressive fibromatosis (AF). In this study, gene expression in 53 samples of STS and AF [including 16 malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), 9 leiomyosarcoma, 12 liposarcoma, 4 synovial sarcoma, and 12 samples of AF] was determined at Gene Logic Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD) using Affymetrix GeneChip U_133 arrays containing approximately 40,000 genes/ESTs. Gene expression analysis was performed with the Gene Logic Genesis Enterprise System Software and Expressionist software. Hierarchical clustering of the STS using our three previously reported gene sets, each generated subgroups within the STS that for some subtypes correlated with histology, and also suggested the existence of subsets of MFH. All three gene sets also recognized the same two subsets of the fibromatosis samples that we had found in our earlier study of AF. These results suggest that these subgroups may have biological significance, and that these gene sets may be useful for sub-classification of STS. In addition, several genes that are targets of some anti-tumor drugs were found to be differentially expressed in particular subsets of STS."
"eacam1(-/-) mice. Ceacam1(-/-) intestinal cells exhibited a significant decrease in apoptosis, with no change in proliferation or migration, however. Compound Apc(1638N/+):Ceacam1(-/-) mice demonstrated an increase in intestinal tumor multiplicity and tumor progression. Increases in intussusceptions and desmoid lesions were also observed. We have shown that CEACAM1-L associates with beta-catenin by co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization in CEACAM1-L-transfected CT26 and CT51 mouse colon carcinoma cells. Ceacam1(-/-) enterocytes displayed decreased glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta activity with corresponding nuclear localization of beta-catenin. Increased T-cell factor/Lef transcriptional activity was observed in CEACAM1-null CT51 colonic cells and in Caco2 colon cancer cells in which CEACAM1 was downregulated. A significant increased expression in c-Myc and cyclin D1 targets of the Wnt signaling pathway was also revealed in the Ceacam1(-/-) intestine. CEACAM1 therefore actively participates in Wnt signaling in intestinal cells and its downregulation in intestinal tissue contributes to malignancy by augmenting tumor multiplicity and progression."
"To evaluate the activity of imatinib in treating advanced, life-threatening malignancies expressing one or more imatinib-sensitive tyrosine kinases. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This was a phase II, open-label, single arm study. Patients > or = 15 years old with malignancies showing histologic or molecular evidence of expression/activation of imatinib-sensitive tyrosine kinases were enrolled. Patients were treated with 400 or 800 mg/d imatinib for hematologic malignancy and solid tumors, respectively. Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objective was to identify evidence of imatinib activity with tumor response as the primary end point. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-six patients with 40 different malignancies were enrolled (78.5% solid tumors, 21.5% hematologic malignancies). Confirmed response occurred in 8.9% of solid tumor patients (4 complete, 9 partial) and 27.5% of hematologic malignancy patients (8 complete, 3 partial). Notable activity of imatinib was observed in only five tumor types (aggressive fibromatosis, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, hypereosinophilic syndrome, myeloproliferative disorders, and systemic mastocytosis). A total of 106 tumors were screened for activating mutations: five KIT mutations and no platelet-derived growth factor receptor mutations were found. One patient with systemic mastocytosis and a partial response to therapy had a novel imatinib-sensitive KIT mutation (D816T). There was no clear relationship between expression or activation of wild-type imatinib-sensitive tyrosine kinases and clinical response. CONCLUSION: Clinical benefit was largely confined to diseases with known genomic mechanisms of activation of imatinib target kinases. Our results indicate an important role for molecular characterization of tumors to identify patients likely to benefit from imatinib treatment."
"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children. Highly malignant, RMS frequently fails to respond to conventional aggressive multimodal radiation, surgery, and chemotherapy treatment protocols that also cause significant sequelae in the growing child. Other tumors of mesenchymal origin, such as locally aggressive fibromatoses and desmoid tumors, have been successfully treated with a selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator, tamoxifen. In an effort to identify new targets for RMS therapy, our group investigated the previously uncharacterized ER pathway in RMS cell culture and primary tumors. We detected ER isoform beta (ER beta), but not isoform alpha, RNA, and protein in five RMS cell lines. Immunohistochemical staining of primary RMS tumor sections confirmed high levels of ER beta but not ER alpha protein. RMS cell growth was dramatically inhibited in steroid-free conditions, and this growth inhibition was rescued with 17-beta-estradiol (E2) supplementation. Exposure of RMS cells to 4'OH-tamoxifen (4OHT) decreased cell viability and inhibited colony formation as detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and colony-forming assays. 4OHT also induced apoptotic signaling in RMS cells as detected by cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP)ribose polymerase. This effect increased 3- to 8-fold in steroid-deprived conditions but was rescued by supplementation with E2. Immunofluorescence studies detected a change in the subcellular localization of ER beta in response to 4OHT. Together, these data suggest an active ER beta-mediated signal transduction pathway in RMS. The ability of 4OHT to induce apoptotic signaling and disrupt estradiol-mediated proliferation provides a rationale to explore a role for selective ER modulators in the treatment of RMS."
"Desmoid tumors are a rare form of malignancy with a great propensity for local extension and recurrence. They typically occur in the abdominal wall or within the abdomen but also may occur extra-abdominally. Most cases are sporadic but traumatic, hormonal, and genetic etiologies have been implicated. The only curative treatment is wide surgical excision, but the risk of local recurrence is high. Several adjuvant or complementary treatments have been proposed and the results show promise; the authors review all these therapies."
"Aggressive fibromatosis, e.g., desmoid tumour, is a rare neoplasm of the connective tissue with local infiltrative growth. Because of the high recurrence rates and destruction of the surrounding tissue, these tumours are classified as semi-malignant. However, desmoid tumors tend not to metastasise. Arising from deep musculoaponeurotic structures, a monoclonal proliferation of fibroblasts occurs. Radical surgical treatment with tumour excision accompanied by radiotherapy is the current standard therapy that can be supplemented by pharmacological treatment in a few cases. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We report on 9 patients (5 males and 4 females) with surgical therapy for aggressive fibromatosis. The neoplasm was located on the extremities in 7 cases (4 x upper extremity, 3 x lower extremity), one tumour was situated in the chin and one in the rectus abdominis muscle. All patients were treated with radical tumour resection. Postoperatively, adjuvant radiotherapy was performed depending on the resection level of each patient. RESULTS: In 6 cases complete tumour resection (R0) was achieved. Following surgery, regular follow-ups with a physical examination and MR images were performed. In 3 cases a total tumour resection was impossible (R1 resection). The aggressive fibromatosis had infiltrated the pelvis in 2 cases implying a hemipelvectomy for R0 resection which was not practicable. Furthermore, diffuse locoregional infiltration of the chin region occurred in one case. In these cases, an adjuvant radiotherapy with 25 x 2 Gy was started postoperatively after the accomplished wound healing. Treatment with chemotherapeutic agents was not necessary. DISCUSSION: Aggressive fibromatosis is a semimalignant neoplasm of the connective tissue with an extremely high recurrence rate. Macroscopically, indistinct solid lesions are found with the destruction of muscles and other surrounding structures. Therapy of choice is the radical surgical resection. Radiotherapy is indicated for patients with non-resectable tumours. Pharmacological treatment should be considered for patients with unsuccessful local therapy."
"Fibromatoses are a broad group of fibrous tissue proliferation that arise from the musculoaponeurotic structures. Because of the locally aggressive behaviour and the high recurrence rate of these tumors, various treatment options are suggested but there is still no optimal therapy for these diseases. This paper describes a case of infantile fibromatosis of the submandibular region, which was successfully treated with an interdisciplinary approach using chemotherapy and surgery. A three-year-old girl with a growing submandibular mass over a period of six months is described. The tumor was clinically aggressive, causing bone erosion and invading adjacent soft tissue structures. The diagnosis of infantile fibromatosis was established on histological and immunohistochemical findings. With a combined treatment based on ''low-dose'' chemotherapy including vinblastine and methotrexate and surgery; complete remission was achieved in 30 months. Management of head and neck fibromatoses in child-hood needs a specific approach. Combined treatment by chemotherapy and nonmutilating surgery seems to offer the best potential for cure."
"Fibrous tumors represent a diverse subtype of soft tissue tumors and can represent benign conditions as well as frankly malignant sarcomas. Desmoid tumors and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans are more difficult to classify and tend to be considered in the intermediate risk category. They are distinct entities, but both are locally aggressive processes which are plagued with attendant morbidity and high recurrence rates. Complete surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment."
"Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and the influence of stromal gene and protein expression patterns on the biological and clinical heterogeneity of the disease is poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that evaluation of the gene expression patterns of two soft-tissue tumors (desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF) and solitary fibrous tumor) could be used to identify distinct stromal reaction patterns in breast carcinoma. In the current study, we examined four additional data sets obtained from four different institutions and containing gene expression data from a total of 561 breast cancer patients. We identified a core set of 66 DTF-associated genes that were consistently coordinately expressed in a subset of 25-35% of breast cancers. Breast carcinomas defined by high levels of coordinated expression of DTF core genes tend to be lower grade, express estrogen receptor, and show significantly longer survival across the four data sets. Using multiple tissue microarrays of archival breast cancer specimens obtained from a total of 745 patients, we demonstrated that a subset of breast cancers show coordinate expression of DTF core proteins by stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment. We evaluated the protein expression of a single DTF core protein (SPARC) on a tissue microarray with clinical outcome data and demonstrated that breast cancers with strong stromal protein expression of SPARC show a trend for increased survival. Our data demonstrate that the DTF core gene set is a robust descriptor of a distinct stromal response that is associated with improved clinical outcome in breast cancer patients."
"Desmoid tumors are benign tumors that exhibit varying degrees of local aggressiveness and diverse growth patterns. Magnetic resonance imaging remains the modality of choice for assessment of the nature and size of the soft-tissue lesion and involvement of surrounding structures. Treatment strategies include surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and radiation therapy, either individually or in combination. Despite the benign nature of these tumors, multidisciplinary care is needed to provide combined treatment options. Chemotherapy in low doses is an excellent first-round treatment in any patient in whom contemplated local treatment may produce local morbidity and adjacent tissue injury."
"Calcifying fibrous tumor (CFT) is a rare benign tumor with a predilection for children and young adults that usually arises in the subcutaneous and deep soft tissues, pleura, or peritoneum. It presents histologically as a well-circumscribed mass consisting of hyalinized, hypocellular lamellar collagen, bland spindle cells, chronic inflammatory cell infiltrates, and psammomatous or dystrophic calcifications. Calcifying fibrous tumor of the gastrointestinal tract is exceedingly rare and therefore prone to confusion with other spindle cell lesions more commonly encountered in this location. We describe 4 cases of calcifying fibrous tumor arising in the terminal ileum, one of which caused the heretofore unreported complication of intestinal intussusception, and discuss the differential diagnosis with other common and uncommon spindle cell lesions."
"Amputation proximal to the wrist may be oncologically dictated in cases of upper extremity soft tissue sarcoma and aggressive fibromatosis. Literature on functional long-term results and patient-oriented assessment is sparse. Our study is concerned with subjective impressions of quality of life and upper extremity health status and their importance in the evaluation and interpretation of results after amputation of the hand. PATIENTS/METHODS: Between 1999 and 2007, 14 patients (6 females/8 males; average age: 25 years) were operated because of a soft tissue sarcoma (n = 11) or aggressive fibromatosis (n = 3). Ten patients underwent limb-sparing surgery. There were two amputations at the level of the forearm. Local recurrence following forequarter amputation due to aggressive fibromatosis required reoperation in another patient. A heterotopic replantation after resection was carried out in one patient. In patients with amputations, the self-reported upper extremity-specific health status and quality of life were measured with the DASH score. Disturbances in body image and symptoms of depression were assessed psychiatrically. RESULTS: In two cases with amputations, minimal impairments in everyday life and a high reported quality of life were observed (DASH scores: 3,5). CONCLUSION: Self-reported upper extremity health status and quality of life following amputation of the hand can be in contrast to the objective pathology. In patient-oriented assessment of results, individual psychosocial factors that may affect results must be taken into consideration. They also must not be neglected when determining whether patients are suitable candidates for prosthetic devices."
"Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors associated with familial adenomatous polyposis are heterogeneous. A recent staging system categorizes desmoids according to size, symptoms, and complications. We applied the staging system to determine whether it separates patients into clinically significant groups. METHODS: The staging system was applied to 101 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. RESULTS: There were 21 patients with Stage I tumors, 36 with Stage II, 26 with Stage III, and 18 with Stage IV. Twelve patients with Stage I and five with Stage II tumors needed no treatment. Eight patients with Stage I disease received medical treatment, as did 26 with Stage II, 16 with Stage III, and 15 with Stage IV. Six Stage I tumors had surgery, as did 20 Stage II, 12 Stage III, and 13 Stage IV. Chemotherapy was given to 1 Stage II tumor, 7 Stage III, and 5 Stage IV. No patient with Stages I or II disease died. Four Stage III patients (15 percent) and 8 Stage IV patients (44 percent) died from desmoids. Finally 89 percent with Stage I, 65 percent with Stage II, 59 percent with Stage III, and 50 percent with Stage IV disease were asymptomatic; 81 percent of Stage I desmoids, 78 percent of Stage II, 42 percent of Stage III, and 28 percent of Stage IV were stable or disappeared. CONCLUSION: Desmoid staging identifies tumors by prognosis and its use for designing prospective treatment studies is reasonable."

"We report an aggressive tumour in a 5-year-old girl causing facial disfigurement. Imaging confirmed a solid, diffusely enhancing mass at the right internal pterygoid muscle, infiltrating the adjacent bone. Surgical excision and reconstruction of the mandible were performed. Histology revealed aggressive infantile fibromatosis. No recurrence was noted 7 months later. Infantile fibromatosis may mimic malignancies and should be considered in aggressive mandibular soft tissue masses, in order to carefully plan biopsy and reconstructive surgery."
"Antecedent trauma has been implicated in the causation of soft tissue tumors. Several criteria have been established to define a cause-and-effect relationship. We postulate possible mechanisms in the genesis of soft tissue tumors following antecedent traumatic injury. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 27-year-old woman with a paraspinal desmoid tumor, diagnosed 3-years following a motor vehicle accident. Literature is reviewed. CONCLUSION: Soft tissue tumors arising at the site of previous trauma may be desmoids, pseudolipomas or rarely, other soft tissue growths. The cause-and-effect issue of desmoid or other soft tissue tumors goes beyond their diagnosis and treatment. Surgeons should be acquainted with this diagnostic entity as it may also involve questions of longer follow-up and compensation and disability privileges."
"A 30-year-old man with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) underwent prophylactic proctocolectomy by laparoscopy-assisted surgery. After 10 months, we found an intra-abdominal tumor, which grew rapidly to 25 cm in diameter. We performed an emergency operation, which revealed that it was a desmoid tumor derived mainly from colorectal mesenterium. The tumor was removed with three short segments of intestine and the left ureter. A computed tomography (CT) scan done 3 months later showed a 10 cm mesenteric desmoid tumor at the beginning of jejunum, approaching the root of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). Fortunately, we were able to remove the tumor without injuring the SMA. To our distress, however, another recurrent mesenteric desmoid tumor was discovered in the pelvis one month later, which grew rapidly from 5 cm to 16 cm within 4 months. During this period, we gave the patient several regimens, including antiestrogen (tamoxifen), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammtory drug and imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), which had little or no effect. Finally, when the desmoid occupied the pelvic space, we gave the patient dacarbazine (DTIC) and doxorubicin (DOX). After seven courses, the mesenteric tumor showed an almost complete response (CR). The chemotherapy caused grade 3 to 4 leukocytopenia, but without any hazardous events. No evidence of further recurrence of mesenteric desmoid has been seen for 4 years. This combination chemotherapy is a promising strategy, even against an extremely aggressive, life-threatening mesenteric desmoid associated with FAP."
"Desmoid tumors are rare, accounting for just 0.03% of all neoplasms and less than 3% of all soft tissue tumors. Although these tumors are benign, they are locally invasive and can cause considerable morbidity and mortality. We describe the case of a 16-year-old female who presented with hydronephroureter secondary to an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor. This case report draws the attention of urologists to the diagnostic dilemma and therapeutic challenges associated with an intra-abdominal mass causing ureteral obstruction especially in young patients."
Fibromatosis are uncommon connective tissue tumours arising from musculo-aponeurotic tissue and characterised by spindle cell fibroblastic and myofibroblastic proliferation. The exact aetiology is unknown but several factors are considered to be positively correlated with their development and growth (genetic and hormonal factors and trauma). Although they are considered histologically benign they behave aggressively locally and relapse repeatedly after surgical excision. Mediastinal localisation is very rare. We describe a case of de novo fibromatosis of the posterior mediastinum in a 61 year old man with no history of thoracotomy or trauma. Although mediastinal fibromatosis is very uncommon physicians should be aware of this disease in order to ensure appropriate surgical treatment.

"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a locally aggressive tumor known to have high potential for local recurrence after resection, while it exhibits self-limiting behavior and shows growth arrest or spontaneous regression in many patients. Thus, its natural course is not well known, and the proper treatment has not yet been established. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinical outcome and changes in tumor size in 11 consecutive patients with extremity and trunk desmoid-type fibromatoses, who were basically observed without any treatment after diagnosis. RESULTS: For two patients in whom the tumors were initially incorrectly diagnosed as other tumors, surgical resection was performed. For another two patients, surgical resections were performed in the follow-up periods due to tumor enlargement or joint contracture. In all four patients who underwent surgery, tumors recurred shortly after resection and re-resection was not performed. During the follow-up periods with a median length of 56 months, ten tumors eventually stopped growing, and three of them regressed spontaneously. At the time of final follow-up, ten patients were alive with residual disease without severe morbidity. In one patient, the tumor enlarged to over 30 cm in diameter with a substantial functional deficit. CONCLUSIONS: Simple observation is a noninvasive and function-preserving treatment for desmoid-type fibromatosis."

"Desmoid tumours or fibromatoses are rare entities characterized by the benign proliferation of fibroblasts, which can be life-threatening due to their locally aggressive properties. Surgery is widely accepted as the first line of treatment for extra-abdominal desmoids; however, it is not recommended for intra-abdominal desmoids because of the high-risk of recurrence and difficulties with the operation. Here, we report on a patient with sporadic intra-abdominal desmoid tumours, who showed partial response following the intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old man presented with swelling and pain of the right leg. Computed tomography showed an abnormal multilocular soft-tissue mass (95 x 70 mm) in the right pelvis, which was revealed by biopsy to be a desmoid tumour. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the tumour cells expressed vimentin, but not smooth-muscle actin, CD34, or desmin. Very few Ki-67-positive cells were found. Non-cytotoxic treatment with etodolac (200 mg/day) was chosen because of the patient's age, lack of bowel obstruction, and the likelihood of prostate cancer. Two years after the commencement of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug administration, computed tomography showed a decrease in tumour size (63 x 49 mm), and the disappearance of intratumoural septa. CONCLUSION: Our case report suggests that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment should be taken into consideration for use as first-line treatment in patients with sporadic intra-abdominal desmoid tumours."
"Desmoid tumors are a severe extracolonic manifestation in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Identification of risk factors might be helpful in the management of FAP patients with such tumors. The aim of this study was to assess potential risk factors for the development of desmoids in a cohort of Dutch FAP patients. METHODS: The medical records of 735 FAP patients were analyzed for the occurrence of desmoids. Relative risks and survival times were calculated to assess the influence of potential risk factors (female sex, family history, mutation site, abdominal surgery, and pregnancy) on desmoid development. RESULTS: Desmoid tumors were identified in 66 of the 735 patients (9%). The cumulative risk of developing desmoids was 14%. No correlation was found between specific adenomatous polyposis coli mutation sites and desmoid development. Patients with a positive family history for desmoids had a significant increased risk to develop this tumor (30% vs 6.7%, P < .001). No association was found between female sex or pregnancy and desmoid development. Most desmoid patients (95%) had undergone previous abdominal surgery. In a substantial proportion of patients with an ileorectal anastomosis, it was impossible to convert the ileorectal anastomosis to an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis as a result of desmoid development. CONCLUSIONS: A positive family history of desmoids is an evident risk factor for developing desmoids. Most desmoids develop after colectomy. No correlation was found between desmoids and the adenomatous polyposis coli gene mutation site, female sex, and pregnancy. Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the appropriate type of surgery in FAP patients with a positive family history for desmoids."
"Intracranial desmoid tumors are extremely rare. The association of desmoid tumors with familial adenomatous polyposis coli was reported previously, with the tumors involving trunk and extremities. We report a 3.5-year-old girl with intracranial desmoid tumor with familial adenomatous polyposis coli. This condition in a child is rarely reported. Follow-up of the patient after cranial surgery and of the family for this premalignant inherited condition is necessary."
"To clarify the differences in characteristics of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutations between colorectal tumors from various phenotypes of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and between colorectal and extracolonic tumors, we analyzed APC mutations in 86 colorectal tumors from FAP patients including profuse, sparse and attenuated types, 23 sporadic colorectal tumors and 40 FAP extracolonic tumors including duodenal, gastric and desmoid tumors. In all tumors, 1 allele of the truncated APC gene retained armadillo repeats, 15-amino-acid (aa) repeats and various numbers of 20-aa repeats, but lacked SAMP repeats, as a result of germline and somatic mutations. Regarding 20-aa repeats, the truncated APC gene retained 1 repeat due to allele loss in 96% (27/28) of colorectal tumors from profuse-type FAP, 69% (36/52) of sparse-type retained 2 repeats due to somatic mutation, and 100% (6/6) of attenuated-type retained 2 or 3 repeats due to the third or second hit. In sporadic colorectal tumors 74% (17/23) retained 1 or 2 repeats. The truncated APC gene retained 3 repeats in 88% (7/8) of FAP duodenal tumors, 100% (26/26) of gastric tumors retained 2 or 3 repeats and 83% (5/6) of desmoid tumors retained 2 repeats. These data suggest that the number of beta-catenin downregulating 20-aa repeats in truncated APC gene associated with colorectal tumorigenesis is different in profuse, sparse and attenuated types of FAP, and that the association with tumorigenesis is also different between colorectal and extracolonic tumors."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a rare mesenchymal benign tumor characterized histologically by proliferation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts with marked production of intercellular collagen. Predominant low signal intensity on all pulse sequences is said to be characteristic of, but not specific for, aggressive fibromatosis. The principal role of imaging in the management of aggressive fibromatosis is preoperative planning an the detection of recurrence or disease progression in nonsurgically managed patients."
"Extra-abdominal desmoid tumour is a rare tumour and only a few cases occurring in the limbs have been reported. A 35-year-old woman presented with gradually increasing swelling in the upper leg. She had a mild, dull, aching pain in the tumour. Wide local excision was done and the tumour was found mainly in the subcutaneous tissue, which histopathologically proved to be an extra-abdominal desmoid tumour. This case had an abnormal radiological appearance of peripheral calcification of tumour and saucer-shaped lesion in the underlying tibial cortex. The patient had no recurrence at two years follow-up."
"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a well-described inherited syndrome, which is responsible for <1% of all colorectal cancer (CRC) cases. The syndrome is characterised by the development of hundreds to thousands of adenomas in the colorectum. Almost all patients will develop CRC if they are not identified and treated at an early stage. The syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and caused by mutations in the APC gene. Recently, a second gene has been identified that also gives rise to colonic adenomatous polyposis, although the phenotype is less severe than typical FAP. The gene is the MUTYH gene and the inheritance is autosomal recessive. In April 2006 and February 2007, a workshop was organised in Mallorca by European experts on hereditary gastrointestinal cancer aiming to establish guidelines for the clinical management of FAP and to initiate collaborative studies. Thirty-one experts from nine European countries participated in these workshops. Prior to the meeting, various participants examined the most important management issues according to the latest publications. A systematic literature search using Pubmed and reference lists of retrieved articles, and manual searches of relevant articles, was performed. During the workshop, all recommendations were discussed in detail. Because most of the studies that form the basis for the recommendations were descriptive and/or retrospective in nature, many of them were based on expert opinion. The guidelines described herein may be helpful in the appropriate management of FAP families. In order to improve the care of these families further, prospective controlled studies should be undertaken."

"Desmoid tumors occur infrequently in patients who undergo proctocolectomy for familial adenomatous polyposis but may result in significant morbidity and mortality depending on the sight of desmoid location. A case of successful ileal pouch salvage using a multimodality approach for treatment of a large ileal pouch associated desmoid tumor is presented. This approach used neoadjuvant chemotherapy to induce a partial response, followed by complete surgical excision with pouch preservation. This is the first reported case of combined chemotherapy and surgical treatment of a desmoid tumor involving an ileal pouch, and the second reported successful attempt at surgical excision with pouch salvage."
"Familial adenomatous polyposis is an autosomal-dominant inherited disease with development of as many as thousands of adenomas within colon and rectum. All untreated patients will develop colorectal adenocarcinoma. A variety of extracolonic manifestations can occur, although malignant tumors are rare. An association of familial adenomatous polyposis and sarcomas was reported in a few cases only. METHODS: We present the exceptional case of a 24-year-old male with genetically verified familial adenomatous polyposis (deletion of 10 base pairs at position 228-237 of exon 15A). The patient underwent prophylactic subtotal proctocolectomy and ileal-pouch rectal anastomosis in 2003. Two years later, an obstruction of the left ureter caused by a retroperitoneal mass was diagnosed. RESULTS: Histopathologic findings after complete tumor resection showed a low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma. CT scan and clinical follow-up through 15 months postoperatively revealed no recurrent tumor growth. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of familial adenomatous polyposis with metachronous retroperitoneal fibromyxoid sarcoma. Proctocolectomy or total colectomy and complete tumor resection is the treatment of choice in this case. In addition to more common semimalignant retroperitoneal desmoid tumors in familial adenomatous polyposis patients, a malignant soft-tissue tumor also has to be considered for differential diagnosis."
"We investigated treatment results and the role of potential prognostic factors in patients treated by surgery with or without adjuvant radiotherapy for primary or recurrent extra-abdominal desmoid tumors. METHODS: The study included 38 patients (23 females, 15 males; mean age 24 years; range 5 to 61 years) who underwent surgical treatment for extra-abdominal desmoid tumors. Of these, eight patients (21.1%) already had recurrences before treatment. Involvement was in the upper extremity in 12 cases (31.6%), in the lower extremity in 22 cases (57.9%), and in the axial region in four cases (10.5%). Twenty-two patients received adjuvant radiotherapy following surgical resection. Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. The mean follow-up period was 7.3 years (2.5 to 228 months). RESULTS: Twenty patients (52.6%) developed recurrences after treatment. Of these, recurrences were already present in six patients, and adjuvant radiotherapy was administered to 11 patients (55%). Recurrences developed at the irradiated site in eight patients, and in other regions in three patients. The mean disease-free survival was 38+/-8 months, and eight-year disease-free survival was 35.7+/-8.5%. Disease-free survival did not differ significantly between patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy (47.9+/-7.9 months) and those treated with surgery alone (37.9+/-12.4 months), and between patients who developed a recurrence at the resection site (12.1+/-4.7 months) or at a different site (24.3+/-1.0 months) (p>0.05). None of the potential prognostic factors including gender, age, localization, surgical margin, or adjuvant irradiation were found to affect disease-free survival. CONCLUSION: In our series, no prognostic factor could be identified as having an association with the high recurrence rate."
"We undertook this study to describe the clinical characteristics of primary benign chest wall tumors and to evaluate the results of surgical treatment. METHODS: We included patients with primary benign chest wall tumors who underwent surgical resection at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia from January 1990 to December 2002. All patients had histological confirmation of benign tumor. Descriptive analysis was carried out. RESULTS: There were 17 patients, nine women (53%), with an average age of 35.1 years (interval 16-66 years). The most frequent tumor was chondroma in seven cases (41%), followed by aponeurotic-muscle fibromatosis in five (30%) and the remaining five patients had other tumor types. All patients were subject to thoracic wall resection, including at least one rib in each patient. In three patients the sternum was resected (17.6%), the clavicle in two (11.7%), thoracic vertebrae in one (5.9%) and associated structures in four patients (23.5%). In eight patients (47%) the thoracic wall was reconstructed with marlex mesh, whereas the remaining patients required no reconstruction. Of the 17 patients, 16 are alive without disease and one presented delayed recurrence with an aponeurotic-muscle fibromatosis requiring a new thoracic wall resection. One patient presented with respiratory complications and died after 42 days due to thoracic wall instability. Average follow-up time was 103 months. CONCLUSIONS: Primary benign chest wall tumors are locally aggressive and must be treated with wide resection of the thoracic wall. In addition, surgical reconstruction with prosthetic materials and/or myocutaneous flaps is done prior to resection, for stability of the thorax when the localization is anterior or lateral."
"Endometriosis is a frequent benign disorder. Malignancy arising in extraovarian endometriosis is a rare event. A 49-year-old woman is presented with a large painful abdominal wall mass. She underwent a myomectomy, 20 years before, for uterus leiomyoma. Computed tomography suggested that this was a desmoid tumor and she underwent surgery. Histological examination showed a clear cell adenocarcinoma associated with endometriosis foci. Pelvic ultrasound, computed tomography, and endometrial curettage did not show any malignancy or endometriosis in the uterus and ovaries. Adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended, but the patient was lost to follow up. Six months later, she returned with a recurrence of the abdominal wall mass. She was given chemotherapy and then she was reoperated."
"Tissue infiltration is different in desmoid and fibroma tumours. Both produce high levels of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1), which is related to extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation which in turn regulates cell function and cell migration. Interactions between collagen, proteoglycans and cell surface fibronectin are involved in the assembly and functions of the ECM. As toremifene inhibits collagen and TGFbeta1 synthesis, we tested it in normal, desmoid and fibroma fibroblasts. We will report the changes in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen synthesis, TGFbeta1 activity, fibronectin mRNA expression and TGFbeta1 receptors after toremifene treatment in normal, fibroma and desmoid fibroblasts. We evaluated GAG and collagen synthesis with 3H-glucosamine and 3H-proline incorporation, TGFbeta1 activity with the ELISA method, TGFbeta1 receptor affinity with 125I-TGFbeta1 binding and total RNA with Northern blot analysis. GAG and collagen synthesis, TGFbeta1 activity and fibronectin levels were higher in fibroma and desmoid than normal fibroblasts. The increase was greater in desmoid than fibroma tumour cells. Toremifene treatment reduced GAG and collagen synthesis, TGFbeta1 activity and fibronectin levels in all cell cultures. The percentage reduction in GAG was similar in all cultures; the reduction in collagen synthesis and TGFbeta1 activity was the highest in desmoid fibroblasts. TGFbeta1 receptors were higher in fibroma and desmoid cells than controls. Toremifene reduced TGFbeta1 receptors only in desmoid fibroblasts, with no effect on the changes in type I, II, and III receptors. Our data show that toremifene modifies the ECM components that regulate cytokine activity and cell migration. The reduction in receptor number only in desmoid cells suggests that toremifene may reduce TGFbeta1's affinity for its receptors. Synthesis of a substance regulating protein kinase activity, which is directly involved in the link between TGFbeta1 and its receptors, cannot be excluded."
"The purpose of this study is to report the clinical course and outcome in 7 patients with aggressive fibromatosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between the years 2000 and 2003, 7 patients who were treated with combined modalities were evaluated retrospectively. Patients' demographic information, including age and gender, tumour characteristics, surgical resection, and the use of radiotherapy were recorded and evaluated. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 34 years. The median time to follow-up was 15.5 months. Resection was performed with positive surgical margins in three cases. Three patients were evaluated as inoperable and one patient was treated with debulking surgery. All patients received radiation therapy with a median dose of 51 Gy. At follow-up, three patients had no evidence of disease, three patients were alive with disease, and one patient died 15 days after radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Local control is the primary problem in aggressive fibromatosis. There is no appropriate treatment for aggressive fibromatosis and the type of treatment depends on tumour characteristics and location as well as patient characteristics."
"This article reviews some of the benign and malignant oral soft-tissue swellings that occur in children, with an emphasis on their clinical presentation, etiology, histopathology, and treatment. These lesions include single and multiple nodules, reactive lesions, and benign and malignant neoplasms. Diseases discussed include reactive gingival swelling, generalized gingival fibromatosis, melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy, fibromas, vascular lesions, salivary gland lesions, and infantile rhabdomyomas. Also covered are lesions that may present in multiples, such as neuromas, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b, neurofibromatosis, and human papilloma virus-related benign epithelial lesions. Benign but locally aggressive and malignant neoplasms are discussed, such as aggressive fibromatosis, myofibromatosis, fibrosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma."
"10 weeks to 27 years), and 6 of the patients were male. No nuclear staining for beta-catenin was seen in the fibroma cells by immunoperoxidase methods. The beta-catenin exon 3 sequence data showed no mutations in any of the 9 tumors. We conclude that despite their morphologic similarity, cardiac fibroma and desmoid fibromatosis do not share this common molecular pathway of neoplastic growth."
"To date there are only few reports concerning chromosomal changes in desmoid tumors. To extend the knowledge in this field we examined 19 samples from the patients diagnosed with desmoid tumors. In the present study formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded desmoid tumors were analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a-satellite probes for chromosomes X, Y, 8 and 20. Chromosomal abnormalities were found in 6 cases, both abdominal and extra-abdominal tumors. FISH studies revealed one case of trisomy 8 and trisomy 20. In four patients we have identified monosomy 20. Our findings confirm earlier reports concerning the diversity of chromosomal changes in desmoid tumors and might suggest that both groups of abdominal and extra-abdominal tumors are genuine neoplasms."
"To evaluate long-term outcomes in patients with desmoid fibromatosis treated with radiation therapy (RT), with or without surgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1965 and 2005, 115 patients with desmoid tumors were treated with RT at our institution. The median age was 29 years (range, 8-73 years). Of the patients, 41 (36%) received RT alone (median dose, 56 Gy) for gross disease, and 74 (64%) received combined-modality treatment (CMT) consisting of a combination of surgery and RT (median dose, 50.4 Gy). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 10.1 years. Local control (LC) rates at 5 and 10 years were 75% and 74%, respectively. On univariate analysis, LC was significantly influenced by tumor size (< or =5 cm vs. 5-10 cm vs. >10 cm) (p = 0.02) and age (< or = 30 vs. >30 years) (p = 0.02). There was no significant difference in LC for patients treated with RT alone for gross disease vs. CMT. For patients treated with CMT, only tumor size significantly influenced LC (p = 0.02). Patients with positive margins after surgery did not have poorer LC than those with negative margins (p = 0.38). Radiation-related complications occurred in 20 (17%) of patients and were associated with dose >56 Gy (p = 0.001), age < or =30 years (p = 0.009), and receipt of RT alone vs. CMT (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Desmoid tumors are effectively controlled with RT administered either as an adjuvant to surgery when resection margins are positive or alone for gross disease when surgical resection is not feasible. Doses >56 Gy may not be necessary to control gross disease and are associated with high rates of radiation-related complications."
"Extra-abdominal aggressive fibromatosis (EAAF) is a benign desmoid tumor with a potentially aggressive behavior. Surgical treatment is compromised by a very high rate of recurrence, sometimes with significant morbidity. We conducted a prospective surveillance of our patients (clinical and MRI) with EAAF to search for prognostic factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cohort included 17 patients with EAAF. For nine patients, biopsy alone was performed. For eight, the tumor was a recurrence after surgical removal. Patients were seen for a clinical assessment and MRI every six months. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 42 months (range 6-114). Three patients worsened clinically with pain or functional impairment. One patient required neurosurgery to control pain (good stable outcome). MRI showed progression for two tumors (12%) but with a short follow-up since diagnosis (9 and 14 months), in one case despite medical treatment. Three tumors regressed and twelve remained stable on successive MRI. On average the tumor growth lasted ten months. DISCUSSION: Tumor growth was never noted beyond 36 months. This notion of an interruption in tumor growth is mentioned sporadically in reports on EAAF, which have generally included recurrent tumors. To our knowledge this is the first series reporting tumors left in place a followed with modern imaging techniques. The high rate of spontaneous interruption of tumor growth must be counterbalanced with the difficult task of local treatment: the risk of recurrence is particularly high after surgery and functional sequelae can be significant when wide resection is proposed in an anatomically difficult localization. The precise role for surgery, and combined radiotherapy, remain to be determined. There are only scarce reports on general treatments. Considering these facts, we propose that surgical resection should not be considered the only solution for the treatment of EAAF. Further work is needed to define the useful contribution of simple surveillance of these benign tumors."

"Fibromatosis-type fibromas were found to develop at abdominal surgical sites in 4 heterozygous Nihon rats, a model for the human Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome. In all 4 rats, solitary and firm nodules were located within the lateral abdominal musculature involving the full thickness of the abdominal wall at the sites of laparotomy. Histologically, the nodules consisted of well-differentiated fibroblastic spindle-shaped cells. These cells were surrounded by large amounts of collagen fibers, and appeared to infiltrate within the abdominal musculature. A portion of the spindle-shaped cells showed features of myofibroblasts. These characteristics are consistent with desmoid tumors in human. Although the etiology of desmoid tumors in human remains unclear, they are known to occur in association with hormonal factors, surgical trauma, and familial adenomatous polyposis. In animals, they have been reported in dogs, cats, horses, and genetically modified mouse models for human familial adenomatous polyposis. The development of the tumors in the Nihon rats was apparently associated with surgical incisions. Genetic factor should be involved in the occurrence of the tumor, since it was found only in the Nihon rats among many rats. Our present data suggest that Bhd gene mutation is not likely to be a candidate."
"Desmoid tumor is a monoclonal, fibroblastic proliferation arising in musculoaponeurotic structures. This connective tissue hyperplasia infiltrates locally, recurs frequently after resection but does not metastasize. Abdominal desmoid occurs sporadically, in association with some familial syndromes and often represents a clinical dilemma for surgeons. The enigmatic biology and anatomical location of abdominal desmoids make treatment recommendations difficult. This distinct pathological entity is reviewed with a specific focus on aetiology and management."
"Deep fibromatosis is a rare locally aggressive but not metastasizing proliferation. Intra-abdominal fibromatosis (IAF) occurs either in association with Gardner's syndrome or as a sporadic event and presents in most cases differential diagnostic problems with myofibroblastic or fibroblastic tumors, characterized by a more aggressive biological behaviour such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). In absence of loco-regional and/or distant metastasis differential diagnosis may be difficult and represents a topical issue, since it influences treatment choice. We describe the case of a patient with sporadic IAF in which the tumor locally involved the mesentery and presented no loco-regional and distant spread. On histology, some morphological features of the neoplasm were in common with a GIST. Definitive diagnosis was made, postoperatively, on the basis of immunohistochemical findings."
"Sarcomas comprise a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal neoplasms. They can be grouped into 2 general categories, soft tissue sarcoma and primary bone sarcoma, which have different staging and treatment approaches. This review includes a discussion of both soft tissue sarcomas (malignant fibrous histiocytoma, liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, angiosarcoma, Kaposi sarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, aggressive fibromatosis or desmoid tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, and primary alveolar soft-part sarcoma) and primary bone sarcomas (osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, giant cell tumor, and chondrosarcoma). The 3 most important prognostic variables are grade, size, and location of the primary tumor. The approach to a patient with a sarcoma begins with a biopsy that obtains adequate tissue for diagnosis without interfering with subsequent optimal definitive surgery. Subsequent treatment depends on the specific type of sarcoma. Because sarcomas are relatively uncommon yet comprise a wide variety of different entities, evaluation by oncology teams who have expertise in the field is recommended. Treatment and follow-up guidelines have been published by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (www.nccn.org)."
"Extra-abdominal fibromatosis of the breast is rare with the clinical and radiological features closely resembled malignant breast tumour. We describe, in a 40-year-old Chinese male patient with a palpable left breast mass, the clinical, radiological and pathological features of this benign though locally aggressive tumour."
"To discuss the therapy of aggressive fibromatosis of head and neck in children. METHOD: Three cases of aggressive fibromatosis of head and neck were analyzed retrospectively. RESULT: Total tumor removal was achieved in all cases and the diagnosis was confirmed pathologically. No recurrence was found during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Aggressive fibromatosis is a rare, benign but locally infiltrative condition. Complete surgical removal was a chief treatment. But it was sometimes impossible in the head and neck area because of associated growth problems. Cosmic problems and facial deformity were the main obstacles of surgery."
"Desmoid tumor, also referred to as aggressive fibromatosis, is a relatively rare, locally infiltrative, histologically benign tumor. This report details a case of desmoid tumor presented as a superior sulcus tumor, which showed a unique manifestation in the vertebral bodies on computed tomography."
"Desmoid tumors are monoclonal proliferations that fall within a broad histologic spectrum of fibrous mesenchymal tumors that ranges from benign proliferations of scar tissue to high-grade fibrosarcomas. These low-grade tumors are extremely infiltrative locally, but lack the ability to metastasize systemically. While they are only rarely a direct cause of mortality, using current therapeutic modalities, these tumors have a high rate of local recurrence that can result in significant treatment related morbidity. Sporadic desmoids are usually associated with somatic mutations in codons 41 or 45 of exon 3 of beta-catenin (CTNNB1). Desmoid tumors occurring in the background of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) usually contain inactivating germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. CTNNB1 and APC are part of the Wnt signaling pathway and mutations in either gene result in stabilization of the beta-catenin protein and allow nuclear translocation and binding of beta-catenin to the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/Lef) family of transcription factors, resulting in activation of target genes which may underlie desmoid tumor biology and clinical behavior. In an era of molecularly targeted therapeutics there is a real need to better grasp the molecular mechanisms behind desmoid tumorigenesis and progression. This knowledge will eventually result in the development of patient and tumor tailored therapies and assist in the control and eradication of this disease."
"Actinomycosis is a chronic, suppurative, granulomatous, fibrosing infection that usually occurs in the cervicofacial region. Actinomyces israelii is the most common organism, with sporadic cases being caused by A. odontolyticus. Even though actinomyces are part of the normal oral flora, infections are rare; rarer still is actinomycotic infection of the facial skin. We describe a case of actinomycosis of the skin of the chin, which histologically mimicked a desmoid tumour."
"RNA and protein analysis revealed the consistent upregulation of the neural transcription factors ZIC1 and ZIC4 in desmoid tumors and other fibroproliferative disorders. The 5' flanking region of the ZIC1 promoter was unmethylated in desmoid tumor fibroblasts, while a hypermethylated ZIC1 promoter was found in human and mouse cell lines not expressing the gene. In addition, expressing cells showed a H3K4me2 at the ZIC1 promoter, whereas non-expressing cells showed higher levels of H3K9me2 in the same region. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing ZIC1 expression in mesenchymal proliferations and a role for DNA methylation in the control of ZIC1 expression."
"Non-lymphoid mesenchymal neoplasms of salivary gland origin are rare, accounting for 1.9-5% of major salivary gland tumors. We describe the clinico-pathologic features of 18 cases of mesenchymal neoplasms of the major salivary glands experienced at Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, from 1998 to 2004. Mesenchymal neoplasms accounted for 3.4% of the total of 524 major salivary gland tumors. The parotid gland was the preponderant site (15 cases). Thirteen tumors were benign, constituting 3.5% of the total of 371 benign neoplasms. Schwannomas were the most common benign tumors (six cases), followed by lipomas (three cases), plexiform neurofibroma, hemangioma, desmoid tumor, and solitary fibrous tumor (one each). The malignant tumors consisted of one dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, synovial sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, pleomorphic liposarcoma and desmoplastic small round cell tumor each. Immunohistochemical analysis for the expression of vimentin, actin, desmin, neuron-specific enolase, keratin, CD34, CD99 and bcl-2 contributed to the differential diagnoses. Genetic analysis for fusion transcripts was conclusive in the diagnosis of desmoplastic small round cell tumor, which is extremely rare at this location. Pre-operative imaging study and fine needle aspiration cytology had limitations in prediction of the mesenchymal nature of the tumors, due to either low index of suspicion, similarities to mixed tumors, or specimen inadequacy. Awareness of the development of various mesenchymal tumors in the major salivary glands could increase the accuracy of preoperative and postoperative diagnosis, and therapeutic efficacy."
"Soft tissue sarcomas represent a heterogeneous group of tumours with a wide range of clinical behaviour. Exact determination of diagnosis and prognosis is critical in order to guide surgical decisions and provide systemic therapy or radiation for patients. The value of consultative second opinions has been proven for general surgical pathology; some studies suggest an even higher value for the soft tissue tumour specimens in particular. METHODS: We reviewed 603 patients who were operated on at our institution with the diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma and aggressive fibromatosis; we focused on mismatches in primary and definite tumour-entity and -grading with respect to the diagnosing institution and the primary surgical procedure. RESULTS: We found concordant primary diagnosis in 28.3% for pathologists in private clinics, 29.6% for hospital pathologists, 36.8% for academic medical centres (university hospitals) and 70.5% for the Department of Pathology at our institution. An improvement in diagnosis or confirmation of the correct primary diagnosis by the second opinion was seen in 73.1% of the patients; in 2.5%, the second opinion was false. DISCUSSION: For accurate determination of prognosis and to provide optimal therapeutic decisions we consider expert second opinion essential for optimal treatment of soft tissue sarcomas."
"Desmoid tumors are non-metastasizing fibromatoses that occur in 10%-20% of subjects with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors are a major cause of mortality in FAP. FAP-associated desmoid tumors are linked to trauma, particularly abdominal surgery, family history of desmoids, hormonal factors, and the location of the APC mutation. We hypothesized that prophylactic colectomy at an early age might increase the risk of developing desmoids. The aim of this study was to determine whether colectomy earlier in life is a risk factor for the development of desmoid tumors. METHODS: An analysis was made of the association between development of desmoid and age at colectomy, family history of desmoids, gender, and APC mutation in FAP patients in the Registry (1980-2005) at Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. RESULTS: FAP patients (n = 930) from 365 kindreds were identified. Desmoid prevalence was 14% (n = 121). Female patients were more likely to develop desmoids than male patients (17% vs 11%, P = .03). Female patients who had an early colectomy were more than 2 times more likely to develop a desmoid, compared with women who had a colectomy at >18 years (P = .01). Early colectomy did not increase risk of developing a desmoid in male patients (P = .42). Female patients who had an early colectomy (</=18 years) were 2.5 times more likely to develop desmoids, compared with male patients who had a late colectomy (P = .05). The prevalence of desmoids in the 5' and 3' groups was 13% and 38%, respectively (P = .0005). Patients with a mutation after codon 1399 were found to have 4 times greater chance of developing a desmoid. CONCLUSIONS: Female patients with FAP are more likely to develop desmoids than male patients. Female patients who had an early colectomy are at significantly greater risk of developing a desmoid compared with female patients who had a colectomy in adulthood. Patients with APC mutations beyond codon 1399 are more likely to develop desmoids. These results suggest that delayed colectomy might be considered in young female patients with FAP to decrease the chances of developing desmoids."
"Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is a rare, highly aggressive malignancy with distinctive histological and immunohistochemical features occurring in young population with male predominance. We report a case of DRSCT occurred in a 17 years old patient which presented with a large upper left quadrant abdominal mass that was treated with a very aggressive surgical approach and multi-agent chemotherapy. At a 12 months follow-up he is free of recurrence. This kind of tumour has a very poor prognosis. No standard treatment protocol has been established. Aggressive surgery combined with postoperative multi-agent adjuvant chemotherapy is justified not only to relieve symptoms but also to try to improve the outcome."

"Breast desmoid tumors are rare and often clinically mistaken for carcinoma. We reviewed our 25-year institutional experience with breast desmoid tumors. METHODS: A search of pathology and sarcoma databases (1982-2006) identified 32 patients with pathologically confirmed breast desmoids. Records were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Median presentation age was 45 years (range, 22-76). Eight patients (25%) had prior history of breast cancer and 14 (44%) of breast surgery, with desmoids diagnosed a median of 24 months postoperatively. All presented with physical findings. Mammography visualized the mass in 6/16, ultrasound in 9/9, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 8/8 patients in whom it was performed. In 15 patients with attempted needle biopsy, fine needle aspiration was inconclusive (9/9 patients), and core biopsy demonstrated a spindle cell lesion (6/7 patients). Treatment was surgical, with median tumor size of 2.5 cm (range, 0.3-15). Eight patients (29%) had recurring tumors at a median 15 months. Patients with recurring tumors were younger (median age: 28 vs. 46 years, p = 0.03). A trend toward more frequent recurrences in patients with positive (5/9 patients) versus negative (3/19 patients) margins (p = 0.07) and larger tumors (p = 0.12) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, breast desmoids presented as palpable masses suspicious for carcinoma clinically and radiographically. Therapy remains primarily surgical, and core biopsy aided in operative planning. Recurrences are common, with younger age and possibly positive margin status and larger tumor size associated with increased risk of recurrence. As 5/9 patients with positive and 3/19 patients with negative margins experienced recurrences, clinical judgment should be used prior to extensive and potentially deforming resections."
"Juvenile hyalinefibromatosis (JHF) is a rare autosomal recessive (4q21) genodermatosis characterized by a triad of cephalic fibrous outgrowths, gingival hypertrophy and flexion contractures. This paper presents a case report of juvenile hyaline fibromatosis."
"Report of one case of desmoid tumor in a patient who had been treated of a testicular seminoma 26 months before, with excision of a retroperitoneal mass and chemotherapy. On followup he presented with a mesenteric abdominal mass which was clinically labeleled as a recurrence of the seminoma. RESULTS: Histologically it was reported as a mesenteric desmoid tumor. Differential diagnosis with gastrointestinal stromal tumor was performed with immunohistochemical studies. CONCLUSIONS: Desmoid tumor is rare. There are few cases reported in patients with history of previous testicular tumor. It should be included in the differential diagnosis of testicular tumor recurrences."

"Desmoid tumours, also known as aggressive fibromatosis, are rare lesions with an intermediate biological behaviour between benign fibrous lesions and fibrosarcomas. Although abdominal desmoids have an increased incidence in Gardner's syndrome, they are rarely found in an isolated form. We report the findings of a barium study, ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in a nine-year-old boy with intermittent nausea and vomiting, diagnosed as having a desmoid tumour. Although intra-abdominal desmoids are usually detected as a solitary lesion in sporadic cases, the presented case had two mesenteric lesions in the left upper quadrant. There was intestinal obstruction and the masses had invaded the colon wall."
"In defect reconstruction following radical oncologic resection of malignant chest wall tumors, adequate soft-tissue reconstruction must be achieved along with function, stability, integrity, and aesthetics of the chest wall. The purpose of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate the oncoplastic concept following radical resection of malignant chest wall infiltration with an interdisciplinary approach. Between 1999 and 2005, 36 consecutive patients (nine males, 27 females, mean age 55 years, range 20-78) were treated with resection for malignant tumors of the chest wall. Indications were locally recurrent breast carcinoma (patient n=22), thymoma (n=1), and desmoid tumor (n=1). Primary lesions of the chest wall were spinalioma (n=1), sarcoma (n=7), and non-small-cell lung cancer (n=2). There were distant metastases of colon and cervical cancer in one patient each. Soft-tissue reconstruction was carried out using primary closure (n=1), external oblique flap (n=1), pectoralis major myocutaneous flap (n=3), latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap (n=18), vertical or transversal rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap (n=9), free tensor fascia lata- flap (n=6), trapezius flap (n=1), serratus flap (n=1), and one filet flap. In 15 reconstructive procedures microvascular techniques were used. An average of 3.4 ribs were resected. Stability of the chest wall was obtained with synthetic meshes. The latissimus dorsi flap is considered the flap of choice in chest wall reconstruction. However, alternatives such as pectoralis major flap, VRAM/TRAM flap, free TFL flap, and serratus flap must also be considered. Low mortality and morbidity rates allow tumor resection and chest wall reconstruction even in a palliative setting."
"To explore the molecular bases of potential new pharmacologic targets in aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumor). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumor specimens from 14 patients surgically treated for aggressive fibromatosis (6 familial adenomatous polyposis and 8 sporadic cases), analyzed for adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) mutations, were further investigated for beta-catenin, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor alpha (PDGFRA)/PDGF receptor beta (PDGFRB), their cognate ligands (PDGFA and PDGFB), and KIT using a comprehensive immunohistochemical, biochemical, molecular, and cytogenetic approach. RESULTS: No CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) mutations were found in the familial adenomatous polyposis patients, but previously reported activating mutations were found in six of the eight sporadic patients. All of the cases carrying an altered WNT pathway showed nuclear and cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for beta-catenin, whereas beta-catenin expression was restricted to the cytoplasm in the sporadic patients lacking CTNNB1 mutations. COX-2 protein and mRNA overexpression was detected in all 14 cases, together with the expression and phosphorylation of PDGFRA and PDGFRB, which in turn paralleled the presence of their cognate ligands. No PDGFRB mutations were found. The results are consistent with PDGFRA and PDGFRB activation sustained by an autocrine/paracrine loop. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive fibromatosis is characterized by WNT/oncogene pathway alterations triggering COX-2-mediated constitutive coactivation of PDGFRA and PDGFRB, and may therefore benefit from combined nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug + tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment."
"Cervical carcinosarcomas are rare neoplasms; optimal treatment is unclear. CASE 1: A 42-year-old woman underwent abdominal hysterectomy because of bleeding, anaemia and uterine fibromatosis. Histology showed a homologous carcinosarcoma of the cervix. Laparoscopic re-staging (pelvic lymphadenectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) was negative for neoplasia. Adjuvant chemotherapy with ifosfamide and cisplatin was performed. At 48 months of follow-up, the patient is NED. CASE 2: A 74-year-old woman reporting vaginal bleeding, with carcinosarcoma on the cervical biopsy, underwent radical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic and paraortic lymphadenectomy. Histology confirmed a homologous carcinosarcoma of the cervix, stage IIb. Whole-pelvis irradiation and brachytherapy were carried out. Nine months later, the patient developed systemic recurrence and died of disease. Aggressive primary therapy can result in cure of early-stage cervical carcinosarcomas. Extracervical disease is associated with a poor prognosis."

"Desmoid tumors, or aggressive fibromatoses, are rare, histologically benign tumors with biologic behavior that is intermediate between benign fibrous proliferations and low-grade fibrosarcoma. These tumors can cause significant morbidity and mortality by their propensity for local invasion and recurrence following surgical excision. A case of an anterior mediastinal desmoid tumor in a 67-year-old woman is reported with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a locally aggressive deep soft tissue tumor. Some cases are associated with adenosis polyposis coli germline mutations whereas others harbor somatic beta-catenin point mutations mainly in exon 3, codons 41 and 45. These mutations result in stabilization of beta-catenin, and activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. The aim of this study was to determine the specificity and sensitivity of these 3 most common beta-catenin mutations in the diagnosis of desmoid-type fibromatosis using paraffin-embedded material. The results were compared with nuclear expression of beta-catenin. Mutation-specific restriction enzyme digestion methodology was employed to detect the 3 mutations. One hundred and thirty-three cases were analyzed, including 76 desmoid-type, and 18 superficial fibromatosis, in addition to a further 39 fibromatosis mimics. A restriction site was present for analysis of the codon 41 mutation. Mismatch primers were designed for the codon 45 mutations. Mutations were detected in 66 cases (87%) of 76 desmoid-type fibromatosis (71 extra-abdominal). Of these, 34 (45%) were in codon 45 (TCT>TTT), 27 (35%) in codon 41 (ACC>GCC), and 5 (7%) in codon 45 (TCT>CCT). No mutations were detected in the other lesions studied. All desmoid-type fibromatosis cases and 72% of the mimics tested showed nuclear positivity for beta-catenin indicating immunohistochemistry is a sensitive but not a specific test for desmoid-type fibromatosis. In contrast, to date, beta-catenin mutations have not been detected in any lesions which mimic desmoid-type fibromatosis. Mutation-specific restriction enzyme digestion, a simple and efficient means of detecting the common beta-catenin mutations in desmoid-type fibromatosis, complements light microscopy in reaching a diagnosis."
"Desmoid tumors are rare, benign, fibromatous lesions that are the result of abnormal proliferation of myofibroblasts. Desmoid tumors can be classified as extra-abdominal and abdominal. Abdominal desmoid tumors are either superficial or intraabdominal. These tumors are associated with a high recurrence rates, even if their microscopic characters indicate a benign disease; their biologic behavior often indicates rather a ""malignant"" disease, which can cause even the death. Intraabdominal desmoid tumors can engulf surrounding viscera and vessels, thereby greatly complicating their surgical treatment. Management is multidisciplinary. Simple observation is a reasonable management option for asymptomatic patients; spontaneous regression of these tumors may be observed. Complete excision is the treatment of choice for tumors causing symptoms or complications. Surgery should be minimized as much as feasible, while at the same time achieving free margins. Adjuvant therapy should be considered in selected cases; the role of other management options (including gene transfer therapy) is currently under intensive investigation."
"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is characterized by the presence of numerous colorectal adenomatous polyps that progress to colorectal cancer if left untreated. Following colorectal cancer, periampullary cancer and aggressive desmoid tumor are also the common causes of death. The purpose of the present study was to describe the clinical course of FAP patients. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The authors conducted a retrospective study of 31 FAP patients who were treated at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (KCMH) between March 2000 and March 2006. Demographic data, family history, symptoms, extracolonic manifestations, operative procedures, pathologic findings, and postoperative results were collected. RESULTS: Two patients were excludedfrom the present study. The average age of the 29 patients was 33.48 years with the sex ratio (male/female) of 0.93. Seventeen of the 29 patients (58.6%) had a family history of FAP Sixteen of 29 patients were discovered with colorectal cancer with a mean age of34.56 years. Mucous bloody stool was the most common presenting symptom and most of the patients with this symptom (11/13) already had colorectal cancer Gastroduodenal polyps and desmoid tumor were common extracolonic manifestations. The most common operative procedure was restorative proctocolectomy with ileal J pouch (RPC). Wound infection and gut obstruction were the frequent complications. Functional outcomes of patients with RPC were good. The mean age ofpatients with colon cancer was older than the mean age ofpatients without colon cancer However, there was no significant difference between the two groups. The sex ratio and family history of FAP were not statistically different. No significant differences were found in surgical procedures and postoperative complications. On the follow up period, two patients in the later group died of desmoid tumor and pancreatic cancer while seven patients in the former group died of metastatic colon cancer and one with desmoid tumor CONCLUSION: The proportion ofpatients who were discovered with colorectal cancer in the present study was high with young age onset of cancer Moreover, patients in this group had poorer outcome compared to the group of patients without colorectal cancer; of which, metastatic colorectal cancer was the major cause of death. This result may be due to aggressiveness and advanced stage of disease at the first diagnosis."
"Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (YHF) is a rare inherited disorder characterized by tumorous growth of hyalinized fibrous tissue. No report on cytomorphology of this condition is available in English on MEDLINE. CASE REPORT: A 6-year-old girl had multiple nontender nodules on both ear lobes, nose and scalp. Fine needle aspiration of the nodule on the left ear revealed benign, spindle-shaped cells with an eosinophilic ground substance in the background. The diagnosis of JHF was made following cytologic and histopathologic studies. CONCLUSION: Fine needle aspiration cytology is reliable for the diagnosis of JHF."
"The outcome of desmoid tumor in children cannot be reliably predicted on the basis of histologic findings. We sought to determine whether the postoperative presence of residual or recurrent tumor can be predicted on the basis of demographic variables and baseline MRI features of the tumor. We also aimed to determine how imaging features change during adjuvant treatment and how the imaging features relate to the histologic features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two radiologists retrospectively reviewed images from 281 MRI examinations performed at baseline and during postoperative therapy for desmoid tumor. The examinations had been performed on 17 children treated between September 1991 and March 2003. Tumor volume; distinctness of margins; involvement of bone and neurovascular bundle; and T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and STIR signal intensity and contrast enhancement pattern were recorded. Baseline imaging and demographic features were correlated with the postoperative presence of residual or recurrent tumor. Imaging changes during follow-up were compared with treatment response and outcome. The imaging features of eight tumors were compared with percentage cellularity and collagen deposition in biopsy samples obtained within 30 days of imaging. RESULTS: Baseline involvement of the neurovascular bundle approached significance as a predictor of the presence of residual or recurrent tumor (p = 0.08). Other baseline imaging and demographic features were not predictive (p > or = 0.4). Changes in imaging features were variable during follow-up. T2-weighted and STIR signal intensity may be correlated with percentage cellularity and collagen deposition. CONCLUSION: MRI has limited value in prediction of the postoperative presence of residual or recurrent desmoid tumor in children. It is useful, however, for detecting disease and monitoring postoperative adjuvant therapy."
"Nuclear staining for beta-catenin by immunohistochemistry is being used increasingly to diagnose desmoid tumours (deep fibromatoses), especially where the differential diagnosis includes other abdominal spindle cell neoplasms. This study aimed to define the prevalence of beta-catenin positivity in desmoid tumours and other morphologically similar spindle cell neoplasms. METHOD AND RESULTS: Nuclear beta-catenin expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 270 soft tissue tumours. Nuclear immunopositivity was detected in 80% of cases of sporadic desmoid fibromatosis (24/30) and in 67% of tumours in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (8/12). Nuclear positivity was also present in 14/25 superficial fibromatoses (56%), 3/10 low-grade myofibroblastic sarcomas (30%), 5/23 solitary fibrous tumours (22%), 1/5 infantile fibrosarcomas (20%), 1/18 desmoplastic fibroblastomas (6%) and 1/21 gastrointestinal stromal tumours (5%). No nuclear immunoreactivity was present in neurofibromas (0/26), schwannomas (0/25), nodular fasciitis (0/19), leiomyosarcomas (0/16), inflammatory myofibroblastic tumours (0/12), fibromas of tendon sheath (0/9), lipofibromatoses (0/5), Gardner fibromas (0/4), calcifying aponeurotic fibromas (0/4) or fibromatosis colli (0/1). CONCLUSION: Nuclear staining for beta-catenin is supportive, but not definitive, of the diagnosis of desmoid fibromatosis. No significant difference in immunoreactivity was observed between sporadic and familial desmoid fibromatoses. beta-Catenin negativity does not preclude the diagnosis of fibromatosis."
"the reduction in FDG uptake was consistent with the histological evidence of fibrosis and reduction in mitosis. Hence, a baseline FDG-PET can serve a valuable role in monitoring the effect of systemic pharmacotherapy in patients with recurrent progressive disease after unsuccessful local-regional treatment. The findings in this report can be extrapolated and have implications for studying the utility of FDG-PET in defining aggressiveness, guiding biopsy and defining excision site in a large tumour and in monitoring therapy in fibromatosis."
"To evaluate the impact of surgery as first-line treatment on event-free survival (EFS) of primary aggressive fibromatosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Treatments were categorized into: surgery with or without radiotherapy and nonsurgical strategies with systemic treatment alone or wait and see policy. Eighty-nine patients had initial resection of their primary tumour followed by postoperative radiotherapy in 13 cases. Twenty-three did not undergo surgery but received systemic treatment or watch and wait policy. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 76 months. Overall 3 years EFS was 49%. In the univariate analysis, patients with microscopically complete surgery had a similar outcome to patients in the no-surgery group (3 years EFS of 65% and 68%, respectively). Gender, age, tumour size, treatment period and strategy (surgery versus no-surgery) were not statistically significant. Quality of resection according to margins and the tumour site were the only prognostic factors. There was a significant correlation between tumour site and quality of surgery (p=0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: A subset of patients with extra-abdominal fibromatosis could be managed with a nonaggressive policy, as growth arrest concerned 2/3 of nonoperated patients. When surgery is finally necessary, it should be performed with the aim of achieving negative margins."

"Aggressive fibromatosis (also called desmoid tumor) is a benign, locally invasive, soft tissue tumor composed of cells with mesenchymal characteristics. These tumors are characterized by increased levels of beta-catenin-mediated T-cell factor (TCF)-dependent transcriptional activation. We found that type 1 IFN signaling is activated in human and murine aggressive fibromatosis tumors and that the expression of associated response genes is regulated by beta-catenin. When mice deficient for the type 1 IFN receptor (Ifnar1-/-) were crossed with mice predisposed to developing aggressive fibromatosis tumors (Apc/Apc1638N), a significant decrease in aggressive fibromatosis tumor formation was observed compared with littermate controls, showing a novel role for type 1 IFN signaling in promoting tumor formation. Type 1 IFN activation inhibits cell proliferation but does not alter cell apoptosis or the level of beta-catenin-mediated TCF-dependent transcriptional activation in aggressive fibromatosis cell cultures. Thus, these changes cannot explain our in vivo results. Intriguingly, Ifnar1-/- mice have smaller numbers of mesenchymal progenitor cells compared with littermate controls, and treatment of aggressive fibromatosis cell cultures with IFN increases the proportion of cells that exclude Hoechst dye and sort to the side population, raising the possibility that type 1 IFN signaling regulates the number of precursor cells present that drive aggressive fibromatosis tumor formation and maintenance. This study identified a novel role for IFN type 1 signaling as a positive regulator of neoplasia and suggests that IFN treatment is a less than optimal therapy for this tumor type."
"Mesenchymal tumors of the digestive tract are rare and display variable morphological appearances. Thanks to immunohistochemistry and molecular biology, these tumors are now better classified and dominated by stromal tumors. AIMS: the aim of this article is to study morphological characteristics of mesenchymal tumors of the digestive tract and to insist on immunohistochemistry contribution to diagnosis, especially the c-Kit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: this is a retrospective study of 40 mesenchymal tumors of the digestive tract diagnosed before the event of c-Kit, from 1985 to 1999 in the pathology laboratory of F. Hached hospital in Sousse. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on these tumors with the following antibodies: c-Kit, CD34, smooth muscle actin and S-100 protein. RESULTS: after immunostaining, the tumors were reclassified as the following: 33 stromal tumors, 4 leiomyosarcomas, 1 leiomyoma, 1 schwannoma and 1 desmoid tumor. CONCLUSION: mesenchymal tumors of the digestive tract are dominated by stromal tumors. The latter are defined usually by a spindle cell proliferation, often expressing the c-Kit protein which must be used in all mesenchymal tumors of the digestive tract."
"Desmoid-type fibromatosis involving the brachial plexus is a rare and challenging disease. Due to involvement of crucial neurovascular structures, wide local excision of the associated fibromas is rarely feasible and recurrence is common. The authors describe their experience in four surgically treated patients with desmoid-type fibromatosis involving the brachial plexus and review the relevant neurosurgical literature. All tumors were assessed for c-KIT oncogene mutations in hopes of establishing a biological basis for using the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatimib mesylate as an adjuvant therapy. Three patients experienced tumor recurrence requiring reoperation. Fractionated radiotherapy achieved local control in three patients, and the disease in one patient progressed beyond the treatment field. Single base pair changes at exon 10 of the c-KIT oncogene were identified in three tumors. One tumor with this mutation did not respond to treatment with imatimib mesylate. A review of the literature revealed 17 additional patients in two different case series. Analysis of these cases emphasizes the need for careful resection in patients with desmoid-type fibromatosis and supports the conclusion that without adjuvant radiotherapy a high local recurrence rate can be anticipated. For optimal local disease control, the authors recommend postsurgical radiation therapy regardless of the extent of resection achieved. The mutational status of the c-KIT oncogene remains an intriguing biological marker that in the future may predict which lesions will be responsive to imatimib mesylate; larger series will be necessary to test this hypothesis."
"Desmoid tumors are fibrous, slow-growing, nonmalignant tumors with a low potential for metastasis. These lesions show a high propensity for infiltrative growth with local invasion. METHODS: The authors undertook a retrospective study of 15 desmoid tumors in 11 women and four men (ranging in age from 32 to 67 years; median 48 years) treated at their institution. This study included further resection for recurrent tumors in nine of 15 patients (60%). RESULTS: There were 13 patients (86%) with brachial plexus lesions, one patient (7%) with a lumbar plexus lesion, and one (7%) with a peroneal nerve lesion. There was a female predominance in the study group of 2.75:1. Four patients (27%) reported improvement in pain status, six (40%) reported no change from their preoperative pain levels, and five (33%) reported worsened pain symptoms. There was tumor recurrence in two patients (13%) leading to further surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This case series included many recurrent desmoid tumors of the brachial plexus. Most of these lesions were relatively large tumors, predominantly involved with the plexal elements adding to the challenge of the resection. Currently, function-sparing excision is considered the optimal treatment for desmoid tumors arising in extraabdominal sites. Adjunctive radiation or brachytherapy is reserved for a patient with further recurrence in whom resection would be disfiguring or in whom the disease is more refractory."
"Here for the first time we showed, despite the oncogenic mutations in beta-Catenin, that TGF-beta is a modulator of beta-Catenin levels in tumoral fibroblasts as well as non-tumoral fibroblasts. The results show that the TGF-beta pathway is active in desmoids cells and in in situ tumors. A dose dependent increase in beta-Catenin protein levels was observed after TGF-beta treatment in combination with an increased repression of GSK-3beta both in normal and tumoral fibroblasts. TGF-beta stimulation also led to an altered -- up to 5 fold -- transcriptional activity of beta-Catenin responsive promoters, such as IGFBP6 as well as increase of TOPflash activity. TGF-beta stimulation increased cell proliferation and BrdU incorporation 2.5 times. Taken together, we propose that TGF-beta is a modulator of beta-Catenin levels in tumoral fibroblasts and non-tumoral fibroblasts, despite the oncogenic mutations already present in this gene in tumoral fibroblasts of desmoid tumors. This modulation of beta-Catenin levels by TGF-beta may be involved in determining the tumoral phenotype of the cells."
"Describe the course and immediate post-operative care in patients with intestinal transplant. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Descriptive, prospective study conducted in the Polyvalent Intensive Care Unit of a tertiary hospital for one year. Variables analyzed during the first 48 hours of the post-operative period: vital signs, O2 saturation, weaning time, diuresis, glycemia, catheters, drains, ileostomy, gastrostomy, TISS, NEMS, nursing cares, APACHE II and SAPS II on admission. Statistical analysis with SPSS 11.0. RESULTS: Four patients, 50% women, mean age 42 +/- 8 years. Reason for intestinal transplant: 75% familial adenomatous polyposis with desmoid tumor and 25% mesenteric artery obstruction. They were administered alemtuzumab and tacrolimus. All the patients were carrier of central and arterial venous catheters, and Jackson Pratt abdominal drains (50% two, 50% three). Intubation time (median) 15 hours. APACHE II 10 +/- 6 y SAPS II 16 +/- 4. Means on first and second day of: systolic/diastolic blood pressure 132 +/- 23/73 +/- 11; 130 +/- 25/74 +/- 13 mmHg; glycemia 136 +/- 26/119 +/- 25 mg/dl; diuresis 95 +/- 34/125 +/- 30 cc/hour; TISS28 49 +/- 4/38 +/- 11 and NEMS 27 +/- 0/25 +/- 10, respectively. One re-operation due to hemorrhagic shock. Median study in Intensive Care Unit of 4 days. CONCLUSIONS: 1) They are hemodynamically stable patients with short weaning. They do not have many catheters, functioning ileostomy since the first day and TISS28 and NEMS in the middle of the range. 2) The most specific cares of the intestinal transplant are: surgical wound, drains, ileostomy, gastrostomy. 3) The need for intense immunosuppression implies strict isolation and nursing:patient ratio of 1:1."
"The abnormalities of the Wnt signalling pathway in desmoid-type fibromatosis were analysed, with the purpose of exploring the mechanism of tumorigenesis and progression. METHODS: The clinical and histopathological features of 96 cases were analysed. Beta-catenin, cyclin-D1, c-myc, and Ki-67 proteins were detected in 69 cases using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. Using the same materials, apoptosis of the tumour cells was investigated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end-labelling (TUNEL) testing. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) assay, and sequencing were performed to detect abnormalities of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and beta-catenin genes. RESULTS: APC gene mutations were found in 18 cases (26.1%, 18/69). Somatic mutations of codon 41 in exon 3 of beta-catenin were detected in 13 cases (18.8%, 13/69). No correlation of beta-catenin abnormal expression with the mutations of APC gene or beta-catenin gene was identified (p>0.05). The cases with abnormal beta-catenin expression showed a higher level of c-myc protein expression (69.7%, 23/33) than those without (22.2%, 8/36, p = 0.001). The apoptotic indices (AIs) were significantly lower in cyclin-D1 positive cases and c-myc positive cases (p = 0.015, p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: There are somatic mutations of the APC and beta-catenin gene in desmoid-type fibromatosis, and there are abnormalities in the Wnt signalling pathway. These abnormalities may result in aberrant cell proliferation and apoptosis, which are likely to be important factors in tumorigenesis and progression."
"A 53-year-old man was admitted hospital because of frequent vomiting and poor digestion. Abdominal computed tomography showed a tumor, about 5 cm in diameter at the duodeno-jejunal junction. A barium contrast duodeno-small bowel series revealed stenosis in the therd portion, where push enteroscopy could not pass with normal mucosa. The preoperative diagnosis was submucosal or mesenteric tumor. Open surgery was performed. The tumor derived from the mesenterium and involved the anal side of the small intestine. The tumor was removed with partial excision of the upper jejunum. The diagnosis of mesenteric desmoid tumor was confirmed, histologically."
Primary mesenteric fibromatosis is a rare condition. The aggressive nature of these tumors and the potential for major morbidity secondary to resection makes it a challenging disease for the surgeon. We report a case of mesenteric fibromatosis with involvement of small bowel.
"Sarcomas are mesenchymal cancers, which, in many cases, have distinctive molecular features. Limb-sparing surgery delivered at specialised sarcoma centres as part of a multidisciplinary approach has become the standard treatment for most patients and usually provides excellent local control. Preoperative treatment with chemotherapy is most common for patients with bone sarcomas. The ideal sequence of surgery and radiation for local management of soft-tissue sarcoma remains controversial on the basis of early versus late treatment complications, although preoperative radiation can provide the best results for improved long-term function. New methods for radiation delivery and tumour sensitisation might provide further improvements. However, metastatic disease is common, and conventional chemotherapy provides for only a narrow therapeutic window outside of a few responsive pathological subtypes. Targeting underlying molecular events in specific sarcomas can provide for dramatic benefits, as has been seen with imatinib treatment for gastrointestinal stromal tumours and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Trials of agents targeting the cell cycle and angiogenesis in soft-tissue sarcomas, and of those targeting osteoclasts in bone sarcomas, are currently underway. Biological data and preclinical studies support trials using inhibitors of hedgehog signalling in chondrosarcoma, inhibitors of wnt/beta-catenin in osteosarcoma and aggressive fibromatosis, and inhibitors of histone deacetylases in synovial sarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. Pharmacogenetic approaches will be needed to identify individual determinants of response and outcome in order to maximise the benefits of targeting specific molecular events and keep side-effects to a minimum. Research in stem-cell biology and nanotechnology holds promise for additional novel treatment options in the future."

"Vacuum-assisted closure(VAC) is a simple wound healing tool in plastic surgery. We report a large thoracic defect in a child, in which the VAC was used to cover an exposed polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis. The VAC saved the prosthesis and induced complete granulation of the wound, which healed completely in five weeks."
"cortical desmoid, Brodie abscess, synovial herniation pit, pseudocyst, enostosis, intraosseous ganglion cyst, fibrous dysplasia, stress fracture, avulsion fracture (healing stage), bone infarct, myositis ossificans, brown tumor, and subchondral cyst. Accurate diagnosis and management of these lesions require a basic understanding of their epidemiology, clinical presentations, anatomic distributions, imaging features, differential considerations, and therapeutic options. This in-depth review of 13 potential bone tumor mimics will assist the radiologist in correctly identifying these benign lesions and in avoiding misdiagnosis and related morbidity. This review will also aid the radiologist in making appropriate recommendations to the referring physician for management or further imaging."
"Deep fibromatosis or desmoid tumor (DF/DT) is a low-grade, soft tissue lesion that is notable for its infiltration and local recurrence and its inability to metastasize. Although the histologic features of DF/DT are well described, there is a paucity of literature regarding cytologic findings. METHODS: The surgical pathology files of The Johns Hopkins Hospital revealed 17 patients with a diagnosis of DF/DT with prior cytology in a 16-year period (1989-2005). The clinicoradiologic findings were noted, and the fine-needle aspiration (FNA) slides were available for review in 8 patients. In patients with archived tissue, an immunohistochemical panel was performed that included beta-catenin, desmin, CD-34, and c-kit. RESULTS: There was a wide age range and a wide range of anatomic distribution for DF/DT in this series. Eleven patients (65%) had a prior history of surgery at or near the site of DF/DT. Radiologically, 5 of 11 patients (45%) who had in-house studies available and no history of DF/DT were diagnosed as suspicious for malignancy. Predominantly bland spindled cells with long, fusiform nuclei and metachromatic matrix material were present in most tumors. The tumor cells were present both singly and as fragments embedded in the matrix. Nine patients had paraffin-embedded tissue samples available for immunohistochemical staining. Six of those samples demonstrated nuclear beta-catenin reactivity, and all 9 samples were negative for desmin, CD-34, and c-kit. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that clinical history in patients with suspected DF/DT is important. Because of the infiltrative nature of DF/DT, the radiographic impression often is over-called as suspicious for malignancy. The cytomorphology is nonspecific, often resulting in descriptive diagnoses. Immunohistochemical stains increase the yield of FNA."
During the last 20 years we observed 3 cases with the rare condition of desmoid fibromatosis in childhood. This benign tumor with infiltrating potential has therapeutic difficulties for the achievement of a stable local tumor control (LTC). In this paper we present our experience with the therapeutic manipulations applied to our patients and go through the relevant literature on desmoids tumors.
"This study compared a large series of desmoid patients treated at a single institution to a previously published series from the same institution to determine if patient population characteristics, treatment approaches, and clinical outcomes had undergone change over the two study periods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from a prospective soft tissue tumor database was used to analyze clinical courses of 189 desmoid patients treated at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) from 1995 to 2005 as compared with 189 UTMDACC desmoid patients treated between 1965 and 1994. RESULTS: A nearly three-fold increase in annualized UTMDACC desmoid referral volume with significantly higher percentages and numbers of primary desmoid tumor referrals to UTMDACC was observed in the most recent study period. Significantly increased systemic therapy use and decreased reliance on surgery alone was observed more recently. While the recent series patients had higher rates of macroscopic residual disease and equivalent rates of positive microscopic margins after definitive surgery, the estimated 5-year local recurrence rate of 20% was improved compared with the 30% rate observed in the earlier series. CONCLUSION: Increased awareness of the complex multidisciplinary management needed for desmoid tumor control may underlie significantly increased numbers of referrals to UTMDACC, especially primary untreated desmoids. Increased neoadjuvant treatments may be associated with improved desmoid patient outcomes. These trends should be supported, particularly if personalized molecular-based therapies are to be rapidly and effectively deployed for the benefit of those afflicted by this rare and potentially debilitating disease."
"Extra-abdominal desmoid tumors are rare neoplasms with variable biological behavior. The mainstay of treatment is surgery. Complementary treatment with tyrosine-kinase receptor inhibitor drugs, particularly imatinib mesylate, has been reported in the literature. The purpose of this study was to determine the possible presence of tyrosine-kinase receptors in extra-abdominal desmoid tumors as a marker for imatinib mesylate therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1999 to 2004, immunohistochemical methods were carried-out in 14 patients with histologically confirmed extra-abdominal desmoid tumors to determine c-KIT positivity (existence of tyrosine-kinase receptors and PDGFRA and PDGFRB). RESULTS: All desmoid tumors were c-KIT negative, which demonstrates absence of tyrosine-kinase receptors. CONCLUSION: The histological c-KIT markup is an easy and reliable method that can detect whether a desmoid tumor is sensitive to additional treatment with a tyrosine-kinase receptor inhibitor. Molecular biological analysis for the identification of KIT and PDGFR mutation should be performed before imatinib mesylate is included in any treatment protocol."
"Mesenteric fibromatosis is a rare benign nonmetastatic neoplasm that appears as a sporadic lesion or occurs in patients with familial polyposis, while chylous ascites associated with aggressive mesenteric fibromatosis during pregnancy has never been reported thus far. Here we present the case of a 28-year old pregnant woman, in whom an aggressive mesenteric fibromatosis with chylous ascites was detected, involving the jejunum, superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and pancreas. One year after a successful surgical excision, the patient had no signs of recurrence. The authors report the case for its rarity and emphasize on combining clinicopathological, radiological and immunohistochemistry analysis for management of the disease."
"There has been only one report available that focuses on the treatment with imatinib mesylate of two individual persons with aggressive fibromatosis. The authors concluded that after long-term treatment, for 9 and 11 months, with imatinib mesylate, both patients demonstrated radiographic and clinical responses. The novel therapy should be considered as salvage in patients with aggressive fibromatosis expressed platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alfa, beta (PDGFR-alfa, PDGFR-beta), and/or c-kit, whose tumors are uncontrollable by the standard management. On the other hand, the number of kinases blocked by imatinib mesylate is notching up, for instance the tyrosine kinase, which is associated with macrophage-colony stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR). METHODS: The patient was suffering from aggressive fibromatosis after prior therapy including surgery (R2), radiotherapy, and systemic treatment with combination of tamoxifen and sulindac. The tumor specimen was immunostained for PDGFR-beta and c-kit (CD117), and PDGFR-alfa and cytokines platelet-derived growth factor-alfa and beta were not assessed. The tests for both assessed molecules revealed negative results. In spite of this, the patient underwent a unique treatment with imatinib mesylate at the dose of 400 mg orally once daily for 3 years and 2 months. RESULTS: After three months of the therapy, radiographic (met criteria of SD but small decrease of the tumor was noted) and clinical responses were recorded for the first time. The same was seen after 6 and 13 months of therapy continuation with imatinib mesylate. Currently, the patient is treated with imatinib mesylate (400 mg orally once daily) without any toxicity effects. The last MRI revealed readily a smaller tumor (35 x 20 mm) after such a therapy lasted more than 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with imatinib mesylate has been a well-accepted therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). There have been established four kinases (p210(bcr/abl), c-kit, PDGFR-alfa, PDGFR-beta) suggested as the target for imatinib mesylate. Other potential targets will be discovered as it has lately been determined that M-CSFR kinase activity was blocked by imatinib mesylate. The salvage therapy for aggressive fibromatosis with imatinib mesylate seems to be an attractive opportunity for patients with the advanced disease, whose prior therapy failed."
"desmoid tumors, smooth muscle tumors (leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas), gastrointestinal schwannomas, inflammatory fibroid polyps, and solitary fibrous tumors. Pertinent differences between each of these tumors and GIST in terms of gross appearance, histologic features, and immunophenotype will be emphasized. It is important to separate GISTs from these potential mimics because their treatment and prognosis can differ markedly."
"To determine the prognostic significance of beta-catenin in aggressive fibromatosis and to identify potential molecular markers for new targeted therapies. METHODS AND RESULTS: A tissue microarray of 37 cases of deep aggressive fibromatosis was constructed and subjected to immunohistochemical analysis for beta-catenin, p53, smooth muscle actin (SMA), desmin, Ki67, c-erbB2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), c-kit, CD34 and S100. Complete clinical follow-up was available for 23 patients. Nuclear beta-catenin expression was associated with an increased rate of local tumour recurrence (60.0% 1-year and 0% 5-year event-free survival; P < 0.05). Furthermore, p53 expression was associated with an increased risk of tumour recurrence (50% 1-year event-free survival rate and 0% 5-years event-free survival rate, P < 0.05). The coexpression of p53 and beta-catenin was significantly correlated (P < 0.05). No statistically significant association was seen between MIB1 and p53 or beta-catenin expression, respectively. No expression of EGFR, c-erbB2 or c-kit was seen. CONCLUSIONS: The overexpression of beta-catenin and p53 is associated with a decreased event-free survival in deep aggressive fibromatosis. Further studies are required to establish whether these findings can lead to an improvement in the treatment of this rare neoplasm."
"A 45-year-old man presented with dysphagia. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed an abnormal shadow in the paraesophageal mediastinum, which a thoracoscopic biopsy revealed to be a desmoid tumor that had infiltrated the surrounding tissues. We attempted esophageal stent placement; however, the esophageal stenosis could not be dilated, and bypass surgery was performed first, with tumor resection postponed, and radiation and hormonal therapy were added. Mediastinum desmoid tumors are rare, with only 22 other cases reported in the English language literature. Herein, we report the details of our patient and provide a review of other cases."
"Desmoid tumors may occur sporadically or as part of the extraintestinal manifestations of familial adenomatous polyposis. Different phenotypes have been described and some genotype-phenotype correlations have been raised, associated with different sites of germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. We report on a 42-year-old woman ascertained for a large desmoid tumor of the anterior chest wall with pleural involvement, which persistently recurred despite a decade of treatment including hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery. Spontaneous disappearance of the tumor was later noted after 1 year without any treatment and confirmed after 4 years of regular follow-up. Repeated colonoscopies were normal in the proband and DNA sequencing showed a frameshift mutation due to a single adenosine deletion at position 5772 (codon 1924). This mutation, located in the exon 15 at the 3' end of the APC gene, leads to an unusual and late onset phenotype. The pedigree revealed other isolated or familial adenomatous polyposis-associated cases of desmoid tumors. This family report shows that a molecular analysis of the APC gene should be performed in familial desmoid tumors for accurate genetic counseling and follow-up."

"Tumors of the small bowel are rare, accounting for about 3-6% of all gastrointestinal neoplasms. However, diagnosis and treatment are difficult and an ongoing challenge. METHODOLOGY: Follow-up and clinical data of 43 patients with small bowel cancer who underwent surgery at our hospital. RESULTS: Subgroups consisted of adenocarcinoma (n=16; 37.2%), neuroendocrine tumors (n=12; 27.9%), gastrointestinal stroma tumor (GIST) (n=10; 23.3%), lymphoma (n=3; 7%) and desmoid tumor (n=2; 4.6%). Tumor localizations were within duodenum (46.5%), jejunum (16.3%) and ileum (37.2%). Thirty patients were curatively operated, 13 for palliative treatment or diagnostic purpose. Adenocarcinoma patients showed preponderance of advanced tumor stages: stage I/II in 5 pts, III/IV in 11 patients. Stage distribution for patients with neuroendocrine tumors was 3 each for I and II and 6 for III. Localization was predominantly within the ileum (n=7). Overall survival after five/ten years was 48/37%. Patients with neuroendocrine tumors showed best survival results (75/57%), GIST patients 60/35% and adenocarcinoma (27% each). There was a strong trend towards better survival at early tumor stages in patients with adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis is essential for prognosis of small bowel malignancies. Cure is unlikely if lymph node or distant metastases have already developed."
"Aggressive fibromatoses, also known as desmoid tumours, are rare fibrous tissue proliferations with a tendency for slow, local infiltrative growth. There is an association with Gardner's syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis. Histologically they are fairly bland with no abnormal mitoses or necrosis. They do not metastasize, but can cause significant morbidity through their locally destructive effects. Magnetic resonance imaging is the method of choice for diagnosis, pre-treatment planning and post-treatment follow-up. Surgical excision with a wide margin is the treatment of choice. However, there is a tendency for local recurrence and repeated excision may result in a poor functional or cosmetic outcome. Radiotherapy is used to reduce local recurrence rates after excision and is also used to treat inoperable tumours. Long-lasting remissions can be obtained. Treatment is now planned using modern three-dimensional conformal techniques, similar to those used in soft tissue sarcoma management. There is no definite dose-response relationship, but doses of 50-60 Gy in 1.8-2 Gy fractions are recommended. Systemic therapy has been used for lesions not controlled by surgery or radiotherapy, or less commonly, as a primary treatment. Tamoxifen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used most often as they are relatively non-toxic, but there is limited experience with cytotoxic chemotherapy and biological agents. There are no randomised trials to help guide the management of this locally aggressive 'benign' tumour and treatment decisions are best made by the local soft tissue sarcoma multidisciplinary team."
"Tumefaction arising lately after latissimus dorsi flap harvest are rare and observed in 1 or 2% of the cases. These lesions are frequently related to kystic sero-hematoma and are easily and efficiently treated with surgical excision. In some rare circumstances, a tumoral evolution can mimic a kystic sero-hematoma. We will discuss one case of desmoid tumor arising from a latissimus dorsi flap donor-site scar. The subject was a 45 years old woman who had a breast reconstruction following mastectomy. A dorsal tumefaction, with a benign aspect, was observed during the follow-up period. The biopsy showed an extra-abdominal desmoid tumor. The patient was treated with a large excision of the lesion and reconstructed using two opposing local cutaneous advancing flaps. No radicalization was necessary. No sign of recurrence has been observed at 4 years follow-up."

":The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) who had mutations in the desmoid region of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene that phenotypically expresses desmoid disease, and to determine the role for surgery in these patients. METHODS: Data from the North West Region FAP database and case notes were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Of 363 patients with FAP, 47 from ten families had APC mutations in the desmoid region 3' to codon 1399. Of 22 patients undergoing surgery, 16 developed desmoids, and of these 12 had mesenteric desmoid disease. Complications from mesenteric desmoids were death (two patients), enterectomy (three), local resection (three), fistula (one), cholangitis and local resection (one), bowel obstruction (one) and bowel and ureteric obstruction (one). Preoperative polyp burden ranged from 0 to 100 in eight patients (median age 24.5 (range 16-39) years) and more than 100 in seven (median age 39 (range 31-64) years). One patient had no record of polyp burden. CONCLUSION: In individuals with 3' APC mutations, abdominal surgery is associated with a 65 per cent risk of developing mesenteric desmoids. An alternative strategy might be to attempt to manage the polyps endoscopically."
"Neoplasia can be driven by mutations resulting in dysregulation of transcription. In the mesenchymal neoplasm, aggressive fibromatosis, subtractive hybridization identified sterile alpha motif domain 9 (SAMD9) as a substantially down regulated gene in neoplasia. SAMD9 was recently found to be mutated in normophosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis. In this study, we studied the gene structure and function of SAMD9, and its paralogous gene, SAMD9L, and examined these in a variety of species. RESULTS: SAMD9 is located on human chromosome 7q21.2 with a paralogous gene sterile alpha motif domain 9 like (SAMD9L) in the head-to-tail orientation. Although both genes are present in a variety of species, the orthologue for SAMD9 is lost in the mouse lineage due to a unique genomic rearrangement. Both SAMD9 and SAMD9L are ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. SAMD9 is expressed at a lower level in a variety of neoplasms associated with beta-catenin stabilization, such as aggressive fibromatosis, breast, and colon cancers. SAMD9 and SAMD9L contain an amino-terminal SAM domain, but the remainder of the predicted protein structure does not exhibit substantial homology to other known protein motifs. The putative protein product of SAMD9 localizes to the cytoplasm. In vitro data shows that SAMD9 negatively regulates cell proliferation. Over expression of SAMD9 in the colon cancer cell line, SW480, reduces the volume of tumors formed when transplanted into immune-deficient mice. CONCLUSION: SAMD9 and SAMD9L are a novel family of genes, which play a role regulating cell proliferation and suppressing the neoplastic phenotype. This is the first report as far as we know about a human gene that exists in rat, but is lost in mouse, due to a mouse specific rearrangement, resulting in the loss of the SAMD9 gene."
"Radiotherapy of benign diseases has become a frequently discussed subject while there are neither generally accepted guidelines about the indications of radiotherapy, doses and fractionation schedules nor adequate data about the risks and the effectiveness of irradiation. We have retrospectively analyzed the patients who were irradiated for benign diseases in our department. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During the period 1978-1997, a total of 262 patients were irradiated for benign diseases. Megavoltage equipment was used for irradiation of 253 patients, while the remaining 9 patients were irradiated by orthovoltage equipments. The diseases were grouped in 5 categories, and the distribution of the patients referred and irradiated per year was analyzed. Radiotherapy doses, fractionation, response rates and follow-up were evaluated. RESULTS: The number of irradiated patients has been increasing since the 1990's. The most common indication for irradiation was Graves' ophthalmopathy and the incidence of this group has increased after 1992. On the other hand, the number of patients irradiated for soft tissue, bone and skin diseases, except aggressive fibromatosis, has declined in the past 15 years. Response rates were more than 60% for most of the diseases. The patients' follow-up ranged between 1 and 156 months (median 4 months), but it was rather short for most of them. CONCLUSION: We observed common problems about the irradiation of benign diseases such as variations on the accepted indications, the treatment schedules and followup."
"This study was an attempt to evaluate the possible role of chemo-hormonotherapy as a possible approach in managing inoperable, deep extra-abdominal aggressive fibromatosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A series of patients with inoperable, deep extra-abdominal aggressive fibromatosis, were treated with combination chemo-hormotherapy. Therapy consisted of 6 cycles standard CVP (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m(2) and vincristine 1.2 mg/m(2), given bolus intravenously (i.v.) on day 1, plus prednisone 40 mg/m(2)/day, days 1-5, every 3 weeks) and tamoxifen 20 mg daily. RESULTS: From 1995 to 2004, 9 patients, concomitantly, without selection, were included in this investigation. Their median age was 24 years (range 18-47), with predominantly male sex (6/9). Extremities were the most frequent localization (5/9), followed by chest wall in 3 and abdominal wall in one patient. Tumor size in most patients was 5-10 cm, and 3 patients had bulky disease (over 10 cm). Five patients had undergone previous surgery (3 wide excisions and 2 palliative interventions). Complete remission (CR) was observed in one patient, partial remission (PR) in 4 and stabilization of disease (SD) in 4 patients. In responders, the median duration to the onset of response was 10 months (range 4-14); median response duration was 32+ months (range 14-82). No relapse of disease was observed up until now. CONCLUSION: Systemic treatment should be considered in patients with aggressive fibromatosis for whom local treatment approaches are not possible or have failed. All patients should be included in clinical trials."
"The telomere biology of extra-abdominal desmoids was investigated. In 12 specimens, telomere length was assessed by Southern-blot analysis and telomerase activity was measured using a PCR-based TRAP assay. There was a significant correlation between telomere length and tumor size, with telomeres being shorter with increasing tumor size (p = 0.049), and between telomere length and PCNA-positive cell rate, with telomere shortening with increased positive cell rate (p = 0.017). There was a significant correlation between telomerase activity and age at surgery, with increased activity with younger age (p = 0.015). Telomere length increased with recurrence, but telomerase activity decreased, and rate of PCNA-positive cells became lower, whenever the tumors were recurrent. Decreasing telomere length correlated with tumor size, probably due to increased duration of proliferation in the tumor, and tumor aggressiveness. Recurrent case results may be due to a lower rate of cell division and the presence of telomerase activity."
"We report a rare case of desmoid tumor of the chest wall. A 75-year-old female visited our hospital due to a feeling of oppression in the left chest. A chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large mass in the left thorax. Surgical resection of the tumor was performed under the left standard thoracotomy. The tumor was 90 x 80 x 75 mm in size and diagnosed pathologically as desmoid tumor which showed proliferation of spindle shape cells and collagen fibers. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the tumor cells were positive for vimentin, alpha-smooth muscle actin and negative for CD34. The patient has been well without recurrence for 2 years and 2 months after surgery."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a rare histologically benign fibrous tumor with a potential for locoregional aggression. Treatment is not well defined and several therapeutic approaches have been proposed. Surgical treatment is the reference, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and homonotherapy being proposed as complementary treatment or for inoperable tumors. CASE REPORT: A three-year-old patient underwent surgery for removal of a mandibular tumor. Pathology reported aggressive fibromatosis. The patient was given conservative treatment and was free of recurrence nine years after resection. DISCUSSION: Conservative surgery for aggressive mandibular fibromatosis appears to be preferable to radical mutilating surgery which would have a major impact on facial growth in children."
"A multi-centre study to assess the value of combined surgical resection and radiotherapy for the treatment of desmoid tumours. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and ten patients from several European countries qualified for this study. Pathology slides of all patients were reviewed by an independent pathologist. Sixty-eight patients received post-operative radiotherapy and 42 surgery only. Median follow-up was 6 years (1 to 44). The progression-free survival time (PFS) and prognostic factors were analysed. RESULTS: The combined treatment with radiotherapy showed a significantly longer progression-free survival than surgical resection alone (p smaller than 0.001). Extremities could be preserved in all patients treated with combined surgery and radiotherapy for tumours located in the limb, whereas amputation was necessary for 23% of patients treated with surgery alone. A comparison of PFS for tumour locations proved the abdominal wall to be a positive prognostic factor and a localization in the extremities to be a negative prognostic factor. Additional irradiation, a fraction size larger than or equal to 2 Gy and a total dose larger than 50 Gy to the tumour were found to be positive prognostic factors with a significantly lower risk for a recurrence in the univariate analysis. This analysis revealed radiotherapy at recurrence as a significantly worse prognostic factor compared with adjuvant radiotherapy. The addition of radiotherapy to the treatment concept was a positive prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Postoperative radiotherapy significantly improved the PFS compared to surgery alone. Therefore it should always be considered after a non-radical tumour resection and should be given preferably in an adjuvant setting. It is effective in limb preservation and for preserving the function of joints in situations where surgery alone would result in deficits, which is especially important in young patients."
We describe a case of a desmoid tumour occurring 15 months following an uncomplicated fracture of the left distal radius. The occurrence of a desmoid tumour after fracture is extremely rare and a Medline search revealed only two previous reports. The correlation between the site of trauma and the tumour and the time interval between trauma and presentation strongly supports a causal role of the fracture in the occurrence of this tumour.

"Gardner fibroma (GAF) is a benign soft tissue lesion with a predilection for childhood and adolescence and an association with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and desmoid type fibromatosis (desmoid). We report 45 patients with GAF with clinicopathologic correlation and immunohistochemical analysis for beta-catenin and related proteins. Forty-five patients with 57 GAFs were identified from surgical pathology and consultation files. Immunohistochemistry for beta-catenin, cyclin-D1, and C-myc was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues using standard techniques in 25 GAFs from 24 patients. Information about family history, intestinal polyps, colon cancer, and soft tissue tumors was available in 23 patients. Sixty-nine percent had known FAP or adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), 22% had no history of familial polyps or soft tissue tumors, and 13% had an individual or family history of soft tissue masses and/or desmoids, with follow-up periods of 6 months to 26 years (median 3 y, mean 5 y). The age range at initial diagnosis was 2 months to 36 years. Seventy-eight percent were diagnosed in the first decade, 15% in the second decade, and 7% in the third decade. Eight patients (18%) had documented desmoids concurrently or later; 4 of these had FAP and 1 had familial desmoids. Sites of GAF included the back and paraspinal region in 61%, the head and neck in 14%, the extremities in 14%, and the chest and abdomen in 11%. All displayed a bland hypocellular proliferation of haphazardly arranged coarse collagen fibers with a bland hypocellular proliferation of inconspicuous spindle cells, small blood vessels, and a sparse mast cell infiltrate. Immunohistochemically, 64% showed nuclear reactivity for beta-catenin (9 patients with known APC, 5 without definite information about FAP). One hundred percent showed nuclear reactivity for both cyclin-D1 and C-myc. beta-catenin reactivity had no correlation with age, site, or recurrence. Two beta-catenin-negative GAFs were from FAP patients. In conclusion, GAF has a predilection for childhood and early adulthood, a strong association with FAP/APC, an association with concurrent or subsequent development of desmoids, and overexpression of beta-catenin and other proteins in the APC and Wnt pathways. The proportion of sporadic GAFs that have APC mutation remains to be determined."

"Abdominal desmoid tumor is one of the forms of deep (musculoaponeurotic) fibromatosis. It occurs more often as a desmoid tumor in the abdominal wall, less often in various intra-abdominal locations. In this work, we performed retrospective study concerning diagnostic problems of this disease with the use of imaging techniques. METHOD: Four patients (three females and one male) were examined by postcontrast CT (computed tomography) and one of them also by MR (magnetic resonance). All findings were correlated with the operational findings and histologic examination. RESULTS: The findings were typical only in the case with the lesion located in the abdominal wall, three described cases of the intra-abdominal desmoid provided a broad range of differentially diagnostic possibilities (metastases, GIT tumors, lymphomas, etc.). In particular, the findings in infiltrative processes in intra-abdominal location and retroperitoneal involvement were less typical. Ultimately, the histological findings were decisive. CONCLUSION: The possibility of the occurrence of intra-abdominal desmoid tumor must be considered particularly in younger individuals with rapidly growing tumorous process, which does not immediately arise from the surrounding organs (digestive tract, internal genitalia, etc.), and is located in the abdominal wall or in the abdominal cavity."
Periosteal desmoid is a benign tumor like reactive fibrous lesion developed by repeated micro trauma. We describe the case of a 14 year old boy with pain in his right knee who underwent plain radiography followed by radionuclide bone scan. The final diagnosis was that of periosteal desmoid.
"To find a better condition for KIT immunostaining, five antibodies against KIT were compared, including a widely used polyclonal antibody (pAb) A4502, three mouse-derived mAb (MMA; T595, 1DC3, K45), and a newly developed rabbit-derived mAb (RabMA; Y145). Twenty-three gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) were stained, including five KIT-weak or -negative GIST with PDGFRA gene mutations from a previous report, six Ewing/malignant primitive peripheral neuroectodermal tumor, six malignant melanomas, two neuroblastomas, six seminomas, seven thymic carcinoma and seven small cell carcinomas of the lung as KIT-expressing tumors, and four leiomyomas, six leiomyosarcomas, five gastric schwannomas, four solitary fibrous tumors, one inflammatory fibroid polyp and six desmoid tumors as KIT-non-expressing tumors. The positive rates of RabMA Y145 in KIT-expressing tumors were almost equal to pAb A4502, whereas those of three MMA had lower rates. MMA T595 was positive for mast cells, but negative for interstitial cells of Cajal and some GIST. None of the KIT-non-expressing tumors was positive for Y145, whereas some leiomyosarcomas and desmoid tumors were positive for A4502. At present, pAb A4502 or RabMA Y145 seems to be suitable for KIT immunostaining in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor specimens, especially in the differential diagnosis of GIST from other mesenchymal tumors."
"A giant retroperitoneal desmoid (30 x 15 cm), in a 16-year old girl arising from psoas fascia is reported. Despite debulking surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy, anti-oestrogen agents and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, 3 years later she died from tumour invasion of major blood vessels and bowel, leading to massive gastrointestinal bleeding."

"1) a 55 years old man admitted for acute abdomen and submitted, in emergency, to a laparotomy with excision of a mesenteric abscess including a jejunal loop at about one meter from Treitz; 2) 52 years old man, submitted to an elective excision of a capsulated neoplasm of the little omentum, which had caused an oppressive abdominal pain. In both cases the hystological diagnosis has been desmoid tumor. Surgical treatment of desmoid tumors must aim at radical excision to avoid frequent recurrences (25-65%); these have stimulated the research of other kinds of treatments, since a new surgical operation itself can lead to a further recurrence. Radiotherapy has been investigated with results in 79-96% of cases, antiestrogenic therapy has been used with success in 51% of patients, and high dose tamoxifen seemed to obtain a stable disease in non operable cases. Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been experimented in association with tamoxifen and chemotherapy. Conclusive results on the efficacy of these treatments have not been obtained yet, because of the rarity of the desmoid tumors even in greater Centres."
"A 37-year-old man was admitted with an extrathoracic desmoid tumor invading the brachial plexus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thorax demonstrated a 20 x 9 x 14 cm mass in the supraclavicular fossa, axillary fossa and the right side of the chest. It invaded the brachial plexus and circumscribed the subclavian and axillary arteries concentrically. Biopsy revealed desmoid tumor which was resected subtotally with the brachial plexus. The gross residual mass was treated postoperatively with radiotherapy (60 Gy) which resulted in major regression of the mass. Following radiotherapy, ethodolac with ascorbic acid were administered. The tumor was clinically indiscernible 35 months post-radiotherapy. This case shows the high effectiveness of radiotherapy along with less toxic medical treatment modalities in instances where local control is hard to achieve with surgery and highlights the importance of using multidisciplinary treatments to maintain good functional results."
"Desmoid tumor (aggressive fibromatosis), as a member of a group of borderline neoplasms, is a rare tumor of fibroblastic origin that remains difficult to treat. Treatments with surgery, radiotherapy and different medical protocols including interferon (IFN)-alpha, hormonal agents such as tamoxifen (anti-estrogen) as well as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and low-dose antineoplastic agents have been reported. In this report we describe a new patient with multifocal aggressive fibromatosis who was successfully treated with low-dose chemotherapy consisting of methotrexate and vinblastine."
"To determine the efficacy and safety of using vinblastine (Vbl) and methotrexate (Mtx) in children with desmoid-type fibromatosis that is recurrent or not amenable to treatment with radiation or surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A phase II study was conducted within the Pediatric Oncology Group. Patients were treated using Vbl (5 mg/m2/dose) and Mtx (30 mg/m2/dose), both administered by intravenous injection weekly for 26 weeks and every other week for an additional 26 weeks. Response was assessed by bidimensional measurements of tumor on axial imaging (magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography). RESULTS: Over 35 months, 28 patients were enrolled; 27 were eligible, and 26 were assessable for response. A measurable response was documented in eight patients (31%), and 10 patients had stable disease documented as the best response to treatment. Eighteen patients had disease progression at a median time of 9.1 months. Eight patients remain free of disease progression at a median of 43.4 months from study entry. Nine patients reported no to moderate toxicity. Neutropenia was the most common toxicity (n = 22) and the most common grade 4 toxicity (n = 5). Anemia, nausea, vomiting, and elevations in hepatic transaminases were also common and were reversible with interruption of chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Vbl and Mtx are well tolerated in children with desmoid-type fibromatosis. Furthermore, this combination can promote tumor regression or block tumor growth in most children."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumor) is an uncommon locally invasive non-metastasizing neoplasm lesion. Desmoid tumor consists of fibroblasts, miofibroblasts and a significant amount of extracellular matrix. p27KIP1 (p27) protein is a member of the universal cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) family that regulates progression through the cell cycle. In various human neoplasms the decreased level of p27 was observed. There were analysed 42 specimens of aggressive fibromatosis, in which there were 24 abdominal and 18 extra-abdominal cases. There was performed immunohistochemical analysis employing a monoclonal antibody against p27 protein and Ki-67 (Novocastra, UK). The sections for immunohistochemical study were stained using the streptavidin - biotin method. The average percentage of cells stained positively for all cases for p27 and Ki-67 was 22.1% (SD=29.2) and 6.0% (SD=8.8) respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between Ki-67 or p27 expression in abdominal and extra-abdominal location. Analysis of p27 and Ki-67 expression levels might indicate that low proliferating activity of desmoid fibroblasts is connected with another mechanism than the one, in which p27 takes part."
"Until now, surgical treatment has been the mainstay in the treatment of desmoid tumors, even though it is associated with a high recurrence rate. There have, however, been occasional case reports showing that desmoid tumors may spontaneously decrease in size or even disappear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective review of 8 patients with abdominal (5) or extra-abdominal (3) desmoid tumors who were followed both clinically and with imaging techniques (sonography, CT or MRI). Mean follow-up time was 4.4 (0.8-7.5) years. Tumor volume was assessed in each investigation and followed over time. RESULTS: 3 tumors disappeared, 2 diminished in size, 1 did not change and 2 tumors became larger, 1 of which had tripled in volume at the latest follow-up. INTERPRETATION: Desmoid tumors have probably been overtreated in the past. Many of them tend to regress spontaneously."
"Desmoid tumors have a tendency to recur locally, and traditionally they have been treated surgically. No treatment is sometimes indicated, however; this requires a morphological diagnosis that is not based on a surgical specimen. In this study we aimed to identify the diagnostic accuracy of needle and core biopsy for the morphological diagnosis of desmoid. METHODS: We compared the diagnostic accuracy of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and core needle biopsy (CNB) in 69 and 26 patients, respectively, who had had surgical resections for desmoid. We also reviewed 15 additional cases that had been incorrectly diagnosed as desmoid on FNA but which had different diagnoses after surgery. RESULTS: FNA-based diagnoses of desmoid/fibromatosis were rendered in 35 of 69 cases, and other benign spindle cell proliferations in 26 cases and spindle cell sarcoma in the remaining 4 cases. All 26 CNBs were either suggested to correspond to desmoid (24) or other benign spindle cell lesions (2). Of the 15 FNAs incorrectly diagnosed as desmoid, 2 were found to be sarcomas. INTERPRETATION: FNA is fairly reliable for recognition of the benign nature of desmoids. Occasional over- and under-diagnosis of malignancy can occur, however. CNB appears to be more reliable."

"Desmoid tumors or fibromatoses comprise a number of benign fibrous proliferative lesions that have local infiltrative growth and tendency to recur after incomplete excision. They never metastasize. The authors present a 31-year-old woman who, due to epigastric pain and palpable mass detected on presentation, underwent the excision of firm tumorous mass, 210 x 140 x 115 mm in diameter, from the lesser sac. Compressing the splenic vein, the tumor caused left-sided portal hypertension which subsided after the mass was removed. The recovery was uneventful. The histological examination verified typical desmoid tumor. Twelve years after surgery, the patient remained symptom-free with no signs of recurrence."
"Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF) is an extremely rare hereditary genetic disease of autosomal recessive transmission that is characterized by large cutaneous tumors commonly involving the scalp, papulonodular skin lesions, flexural joint contractures, gingival hyperplasia, and osteolytic bone lesions. JHF is usually diagnosed in young infants and in children younger than 5 years, and the lesions characteristic of this disorder consist of fibrous tissue and homogenous amorphous eosinophilic hyaline material. We report the case of a 9-year-old girl with severe gingival hyperplasia, nasal enlargement, mild osteoporosis, and multiple papulonodular skin lesions. Her two brothers (7 and 13 years of age, respectively) were also diagnosed as having JHF. In the patient described in this report, the maintenance of oral hygiene after gingivectomy enabled the continued resolution of gingival hyperplasia, although skin lesions recurred and nasal overgrowth persisted."
"Benign fibrous (fibroblastic or myofibroblastic) soft-tissue tumors are a heterogeneous group of fibrous lesions with widely varied anatomic locations, biologic behavior, and pathologic features. The four broad categories of fibrous proliferation are benign fibrous proliferations, fibromatoses, fibrosarcomas, and fibrous proliferations of infancy and childhood. The first two categories include nonaggressive fibroblastic lesions such as nodular fasciitis, as well as fibromatoses that demonstrate more aggressive biologic behavior (eg, desmoid tumors). In adults, fibrous tumors are among the most common soft-tissue lesions encountered in clinical practice. MR imaging can be useful for defining the intrinsic signal characteristics, size, and compartmental extension of these lesions. Histologic features of the tumor also may be depicted on T2-weighted MR images. Hypocellular fibrous tumors with dense collagenous components tend to have lower signal intensity on T2-weighted images than do lesions that are more cellular or that contain greater amounts of extracellular myxoid matrix. When interpreting MR images of soft-tissue masses in adults, radiologists should be aware of the clinical behavior, common sites of occurrence, and histopathologic and imaging features of the common benign fibrous soft-tissue tumors."
"Desmoid tumors of the head and neck, also known as aggressive fibromatoses, are rare. They are soft tissue neoplasms arising from musculoaponeurotic structures and characterized of locally aggressive infiltration and recurrences. Complete surgical excision of desmoid tumors is considered to be the only effective method of cure. It is likewise important to make a function-preserving surgery. In addition to the radicality this aspect should be a primary goal to minimize morbidity. MRI is the first choice in the preoperative evaluation of neck desmoids. We describe the successful treatment of desmoid tumors in two cases (M. sternocleidomastoideus, M. levator scapulae). Intraoperative neuromonitoring was very helpful for identification and protection of the motor nerves."

"Desmoid tumor is a benign microscopic tumor that belongs to the group of the deep fibromatosis. It usually arises from facial or musculoaponeurotic structures in the abdomen but rarely is located in the head or neck. Locally, it is characterized by a massive invasion with strong potential for recurrence. CASE REPORT: A 37-year-old woman was hospitalized for a swelling of the left parotid gland region which had progressed for eight years. Physical examination revealed a tumor in the parotid gland, which was hard and adherent deeply, measuring 4 cm/3 cm and sensitive to palpation; without satellite nodes nor facial paralysis. The treatment consisted in a superficial parotidectomy. Pathology was in favor of a desmoid tumor. After an 18-month follow-up, the patient is healthy without any sign of recurrence. DISCUSSION: Desmoid tumors are deep fibromatosis characterized by their slow growth and especially by considerable infiltration of the adjacent structures but without potential for metastasis. Although very rare, the cervical localizations are especially aggressive. This clinical case illustrates the clinical features of this rare affection and offers matter for discussion of therapeutic difficulties."
"Aggressive fibromatoses (AF) are locally aggressive neoplasms that do not metastasize but are frequently associated with one or more recurrences and subsequent associated morbidity. AF in the urological system is quite rare and has mainly been described in single case reports or as isolated cases in a large series of extra-abdominal desmoid tumors. We report 2 cases of AF in the bladder and scrotum, and provide a review of similar published cases."
"The observation of a primary chest wall desmoid tumor discovered incidentally in a young patient is an opportunity to review the nosology, diagnosis and treatment of this uncommon pathology. Surgical intervention should aim at resecting completely the lesion with sufficient margins. Subsequent reconstruction of the bony thorax uses synthetic materials and muscle or myocutaneous flaps."
A case of fibromatosis of the breast in a 30 years old female is described. Only a few cases have been previously reported. It is anticipated that fibromatosis of breast behaves in a similar fashion to fibromatosis occurring in other sites. It is a locally aggressive lesion which exhibits a high incidence of local recurrence following incomplete excision.
"Desmoid tumors that present as a part of Gardener's syndrome can present very difficult management problems. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of intra-abdominal desmoid tumor causing distal small bowel obstruction that complicated the management of a more proximal enterocutaneous fistula from the jejunum. After failure of more conventional management options including imatinib, the patient's disease responded to doxorubicin and ifosfamide. The response resolved the bowel obstruction and allowed small intestinal resection to resolve the enterocutaneous fistula. CONCLUSION: Systemic cytotoxic therapy with doxorubicin and ifosfamide can be useful for patients with complications from intra-abdominal desmoid tumor."
Aggressive fibromatosis (or desmoid tumor) refers to a histologically benign but locally aggressive lesion arising from musculoaponeurotic structures in various anatomic sites. Extra-abdominal desmoids represent about one third of all desmoid tumors; of these only about 11 to 15% arise in the head and neck. Desmoid tumors arising in the infratemporal fossa are exceedingly rare; to our knowledge only one such tumor has been reported in the literature. We present a desmoid tumor arising in the infratemporal fossa with intracranial extension in a twenty-seven year old male and review the literature on this rare condition.

"To determine the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) alpha and beta status of desmoid tumours. Desmoid tumours are rare monoclonal neoplasms that appear to have no metastatic potential. Surgical resection and radiotherapy in the event of a positive surgical margin is the first-line treatment. Recurrences are frequent. Treatment results using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, anti-oestrogen compounds and other agents such as Imatinib mesylate have been published. Therapy with Imatinib has been proposed as a therapeutic option, although in most reports desmoid tumours are reported to be c-kit-. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed immunohistochemical analysis on 124 archived samples (85 patients) of desmoid tumours using antibodies to PDGFalpha, PDGFbeta, PDGFRalpha and PDGFRbeta. All desmoid tumours showed immunoreactivity with antibodies to PDGFalpha and PDGFRalpha, whereas with antibodies to PDGFbeta and PDGFRbeta no specific reaction could be detected. Mutational analysis of PDGFRalpha (exons 11, 12, 17 and 18) and PDGFRbeta (exon 12) on frozen material from 14 patients was performed, but no mutations leading to amino acid changes in the mature protein were identified. CONCLUSION: The absence of an activating mutation in a protooncogene does not exclude the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors through other possible mechanisms, and these might be a therapeutic option for patients with desmoid tumours in whom established local and systemic approaches fail to control the disease."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a mesenchymal neoplasm associated with mutations resulting in beta-catenin mediated transcriptional activation. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is expressed at a high level in aggressive fibromatosis, and using transgenic mice, we found that PAI-1 plays an important role in aggressive fibromatosis tumor formation. Familial adenomatous polyposis is associated with Adenomatous Polyposis Coli gene mutations resulting in beta-catenin mediated transcriptional activation, yet only some patients develop aggressive fibromatosis. Since PAI-1 expression is influenced by a promoter 4G/5G polymorphism, we investigated the incidence of this polymorphism in familial adenomatous polyposis patients who did and who did not develop aggressive fibromatosis, as well as sporadic aggressive fibromatosis patients. There was a trend towards association of the 4G allele (associated with high PAI-1 expression) with the development of aggressive fibromatosis in familial adenomatous polyposis patients (50% vs. 19%, P = 0.1). In familial adenomatous polyposis patients who did not develop aggressive fibromatosis, there was a significantly lower proportion of patients with a 4G allele compared to the healthy control (19% vs. 51%, P = 0.0286). The lower incidence of 4G polymorphism in the PAI-1 promoter may be preventive against the development of aggressive fibromatosis. This data provides additional evidence supporting an important role for PAI-1 in the pathogenesis of aggressive fibromatosis."
"The Authors report on a patient personally observed owing to a tumefaction, mimicking a pomelo, located on the posterior chest wall, in the same site of another past surgical operation dating back to four years ago. This tumefaction was clear at the inspection, not aching and hard-elastic at the palpation, mobile synchronously with respiratory movements, but unable to alter respiratory mechanics. CASE REPORT: The patient was subjected to laboratory tests, which showed nothing pathological, and to instrumental tests (RX and TAC of the chest, bony scintigraphy) which showed a roundish solid tumefaction, with no ""secondary"" interest of bony tissue. In this case, it was executed a posterior-lateral thoracothomy, at the VI intercostal space, in the area circumscribing the past surgical scar. The careful removal of the adhesions between the mass and the costal plane, not without the sacrifice of the periosteum, permitted us the total exeresis. The anatomo-pathological test showed a desmoid fibromatosis (desmoid tumor) extra-abdominal (12.5 x 9 x 5 cm). About this kind of neoplastic masses, the risk of post-surgical relapse is very high; so many Authors consider opportune a radio-chemical adjuvant therapy. In this case, the radical excision allowed the Authors to avoid the post surgery pharmacological treatment and to get no relapses after two years from the operation."
"Desmoid and fibroma tumours are characterized by cell proliferation, glycosaminoglycan and collagen fibre accumulation, high levels of transforming growth factor beta(1) (TGFbeta(1)) and different patterns of tissue infiltration. TGFbeta(1) is related to extracellular matrix (ECM) composition which, in turn, regulates cell functions and cell migration. In this study we report changes in cell proliferation, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen synthesis, TGFbeta(1) mRNA expression and fibronectin levels in normal, desmoid and fibroma fibroblast cultures before and after TGFbeta(1) stimulation. Our data showed cell proliferation, GAG and collagen synthesis, transforming growth factor beta(1) mRNA expression and fibronectin levels were significantly higher in desmoid than in fibroma cultures. TGFbeta(1) treatment had no effect on cell proliferation, but increased TGFbeta(1) mRNA expression, GAG, fibronectin and collagen synthesis in desmoid and fibroma fibroblasts. Its effects were more marked in desmoid cells. Fibronectin favours cell migration, while changes in GAG composition alter cell behaviour and ECM organization. In conclusion our data suggest that the different patterns of infiltration in desmoid and fibroma tumours are due to changes in ECM components and cell-ECM interactions which can be ascribed to altered TGFbeta(1) mRNA expression and TGFbeta(1) activity."
"Analysis of APC mutations in colonic and duodenal tumours from familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients has shown that the site of the first hit, the germline mutation, can predict the type and position of the somatic mutation or 'second hit'. The two APC mutations are selected on the basis of a 'just right' level of beta-catenin signalling in intestinal tumours achieved through retention of some of the seven 20-amino-acid beta-catenin degradation repeats. Desmoids are a life threatening extra-colonic manifestation in FAP patients. These aggressive tumours of mesenchymal origin are, at present, poorly characterized in terms of mutational APC spectra. We have investigated somatic mutations in the largest cohort of FAP-associated desmoids to date, and combined our results with previously published data. Somatic mutations were found to occur non-randomly and the position of the germline mutation shown to be a major determinant of the somatic mutation, a characteristic shared with intestinal tumours from FAP patients. In contrast to colonic polyps, loss of heterozygosity in desmoids involved deletion rather than mitotic recombination. While tumours from the colorectum and upper gastrointestinal tract usually retain one to two and three to four beta-catenin degradation repeats, respectively, most desmoids preferentially retain two repeats (P < 0.001, chi2 test). In addition, most desmoids with two APC hits (87%, 26/30) had one mutated allele with no 20-amino acid repeats (P < 0.001). This feature, unique among FAP tumours, indicates that a mutation deleting all repeats from one allele may be an important component in maintaining appropriate levels of beta-catenin signalling levels in desmoid tumour cells."
"Desmoplastic fibroma of bone is a rare tumor demonstrating the same histologic and biologic features of its soft tissue counterpart, aggressive fibromatosis. We report the second case of desmoplastic fibroma of bone with extensive chondroid metaplasia. The tumor arose in the left ischium of a 51-year-old male, with extension into adjacent musculature as a pseudoencapsulated mass. The infiltrating growth and quality of the fibrous component are characteristic of desmoplastic fibroma, and in addition, abrupt transitions into bland hyalin cartilage were frequent. Discriminating features of this lesion from other bone tumors capable of biphasic expression of fibrous and chondroid elements are discussed."
"Anemia is frequently observed in patients with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. The identification of the underlying causes can be challenging. This study was designed to define the prevalence and to identify etiologic factors for anemia in this patient population. METHODS: A prospectively maintained database and medical records of patients who had restorative proctocolectomy between 1998 and 2005 were reviewed. All patients with laboratory evaluation at least six months after the surgery were studied. The last reported hemoglobin served as the index value. All patients with anemia (hemoglobin < 13.5 g/dl for males, <12 g/dl for females) were identified. A second group of randomly selected, ileal-pouch patients with normal hemoglobin served as control. Demographic and clinical variables were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 389 patients (214 males) had documented hemoglobin values. Sixty-seven patients (17 percent; 40 males) had anemia. The prevalence of anemia was 19 and 15 percent in males and females, respectively. The prevalence was 17 percent among patients with underlying ulcerative colitis vs. 26 percent in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (P = 0.27). The mean hemoglobin in the anemia group was 11.4 (median, 11.7) g/dl. One patient (2 percent) had severe (<7 g/dl), 11 (16 percent) had moderate (7-9.9 g/dl), and 55 (82 percent) had mild (> or =10 g/dl) anemia. One patient (2 percent) had macrocytic, 16 (24 percent) had microcytic, and 49 (74 percent) had normocytic anemia. Sixteen patients (24 percent) had unidentified causes for anemia. Multivariable analysis showed that the presence of malignancy or desmoid tumor and the J-pouch configuration were the only independent risk factors associated with anemia. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia is common in ileal-pouch patients. Malignancy or desmoid tumor and J-pouch configuration are independent risk factors for anemia. One-fourth of the patients with anemia have unclear etiology."
"Our objective is to describe pouchography, CT, and MRI features of the J-shaped pouch, both normal and with pouch-related complications. CONCLUSION: Pouchography is performed before closure of the loop ileostomy to assess the integrity of the ileal pouch and anastomosis. CT and MRI can be performed when postoperative complications, such as small-bowel obstruction, pouchitis, leakage, abscess, intramural hematoma, desmoid tumor, or recurrent Crohn's disease, are suspected."
"Desmoid tumors are rare solid tumors that arise from musculoaponeurotic tissues. They are classified as benign as they do not metastasize. Desmoid tumors can, however, exhibit rapid local growth and clinically they can mimic sarcomas. Their histological appearance can also resemble some malignant neoplasms such as low grade sarcomas, rendering the differential diagnosis difficult. The present report describes a 60-year-old woman with a history of left mastectomy, performed for a lymph node negative adenocarcinoma. At follow-up 4 years later, a solid nodule was palpated below the right breast. The tumor increased in size over several weeks and caused local radiating chest pain. Clinically a breast cancer metastasis was suspected. Open biopsy revealed a desmoid tumor. The tumor was resected together with a part of the anterior hemithorax, and the defect in the chest wall covered with a Goretex-patch. Six months postoperatively, the patient is doing well with no signs of locally recurrent disease."
"Desmoid tumors arising in the lung and pleura are extremely rare and can resemble other, more common neoplasms native to these sites. Alterations of the adenomatous polyposis coli/beta-catenin pathway have been detected in sporadic desmoid tumors and have been associated with nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and overexpression of cyclin D1. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the expression of beta-catenin and cyclin D1 in desmoid tumors and solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs), and to compare the utilities of these substances for distinguishing between these entities with those of other, more commonly used stains. DESIGN: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of 4 desmoid tumors (1 pulmonary, 1 pleural, 2 pleural/chest wall), and 5 benign and 6 malignant SFTs of the pleura were immunostained for beta-catenin, cyclin D1, ALK1, CD34, vimentin, desmin, smooth muscle actin, muscle-specific actin, S100, and pancytokeratin. Staining intensity and the percentage of stained tumor cells were assessed semiquantitatively. RESULTS: Diffuse moderate or strong nuclear staining for beta-catenin was found in all desmoid tumors, 4 of 5 benign SFTs, and 2 of 6 malignant SFTs. All cases except 1 benign SFT showed concurrent cytoplasmic staining. Nuclear and cytoplasmic cyclin D1 staining was increased in all groups. The best distinction between desmoid tumors and SFTs was provided by CD34 (desmoid tumors, 0/4; SFTs, 8/11) and smooth muscle actin (desmoid tumors, 4/4; SFTs, 0/11). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that alterations in the adenomatous polyposis coli/beta-catenin pathway and cyclin D1 dysregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of pleuropulmonary desmoid tumors and SFTs. CD34 and smooth muscle actin stains are particularly useful for differentiating between pleuropulmonary desmoid tumors and SFTs."
"This study examined the mutational profile of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene in relation to the development of desmoid tumors in familial adenomatous polyposis patients from a predominantly Chinese population. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of all patients with familial adenomatous polyposis coli from the Singapore Polyposis Registry. Identification of specific adenomatous polyposis coli gene mutation was performed and clinical course of associated desmoid disease obtained from case records and a computerized database. RESULTS: Two hundred five patients from 75 families afflicted with familial adenomatous polyposis coli were reviewed, with gene mutations identified in 107 patients. Of these, 23 (11.2 percent) developed desmoids. The male-to-female ratio was 1:1.3 and the ethnic distribution was Chinese (n=17) and Malay (n=6). Of the 92 patients with mutations 5' to codon 1444, 11 patients (12 percent) developed desmoids compared with 6 of 15 (40 percent) patients with adenomatous polyposis coli gene mutations 3' to codon 1444 (P<0.01). The clinical course of desmoid tumors can be divided into stable (n=11), variable (n=3), progressive (n=6), and aggressive growth (n=3). Only 3 (13 percent) patients with aggressive tumor growth required chemotherapy. There was no correlation between the site of mutation and the clinical progression of the desmoids. Seventy-four percent of these desmoids (17/23) developed at a mean interval of 2.98 years after restorative proctocolectomy, while only 30 percent (7/23) were diagnosed preoperatively or discovered during the initial surgery. The most common complications related to the mesenteric desmoids were intestinal obstruction (21.7 percent), ureteric obstruction (17.4 percent), and encasement of superior mesenteric vessels (13 percent). CONCLUSION: The clinical course of desmoids in an individual familial adenomatous polyposis patient remains unpredictable and no reliable genetic marker is available for prognostication in desmoid disease."
"Desmoid tumors are benign fibrous neoplasms which arise from the fibrous tissue of intra- and extra- abdominal sites, but their clinical management is sometimes difficult because of extensive infiltration into the surrounding tissues. Desmoid tumors commonly occur in women, especially after childbirth. Recently, both clinical and experimental findings indicate the possible roles of sex steroids in the development and progression of desmoid tumors but detailed information is still ambiguous. In this study, we first examined immunoreactivity of sex steroid receptors in desmoid tumors (27 cases) by immunohistochemistry and compared the findings with those in reactive self-limiting lesions associated with fibrosis (8 cases). Estrogen receptor (ER) alpha and ERbeta immunoreactivities were detected in 7.4% (2/27) and 7.4% (2/27) of desmoid tumors, respectively. One desmoid tumor expressed both ERalpha and ERbeta. Progesterone receptor (PR)-A and PR-B were detected in 25.9% (7/27) and 33.3% (9/27), respectively, and androgen receptor (AR) in 52.9% (14/27). In reactive lesions with fibrosis, only AR was detected in 37.5% (3/8). Sex steroid receptor mRNAs was further examined by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis using fresh frozen tissues, demonstrating the expression of PR (PR-A and/or PR-B) and AR mRNAs in eight desmoid tumors examined and all cases of reactive fibrosis. These results indicate that sex steroid hormones might play an important role in the pathogenesis of desmoid tumors and could lead to the introduction of novel hormone therapeutic approaches in managing patients with recurrent desmoid tumors."

"Desmoid tumour of the breast is a rare lesion. Only 9 cases in which the origin of the tumour was linked to a breast implant had been published up to 2004. We report a case of aggressive fibromatosis which developed on the thoracic wall two years after implantation of a mammary prosthesis. This tumour was locally aggressive. Radical surgery is the treatment of choice and in this case required a wide surgical resection, including removal of the chest wall, to gain control. The application of adjuvant radiation therapy is controversial."
"Hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF) is a rare condition characterized by progressive enlargement of the gingiva. Most cases follow autosomal dominant genetics, with a reported incidence of 1 in 750,000. In addition to cosmetic concerns, the compromised oral cavity may cause difficulty with eating, speech, hygiene, and oral competence. In addition, social consequences can be dramatic, forcing patients to lead isolated, reclusive lives. Traditional therapy uses serial gingival resections (""quadrantectomies"") with primary closure. However, this method is associated with frequent recurrence and additional resections. We report on a family of 12 siblings, 8 of whom, including monozygotic twins, are affected with HGF. We describe corrective surgery for 3 siblings, as well as their long-term follow-up. METHODS: Three sisters suffered from severe maxillary and mandibular gingival hyperplasia. All complained similarly of weight loss, difficulty with articulation, and social isolation. Physical examination revealed massive overgrowth of both maxillary and mandibular gingiva, as well as multiple ectopic teeth. Following diagnostic biopsy, all 3 patients underwent staged resections. The first stage involved resection of the maxillary component, followed by a planned second-stage resection of the mandibular component. All resections included gingivectomies, odontectomies, and alveolar ridge ostectomies. The oral cavity was allowed to heal by secondary intention. RESULTS: All 3 patients were female, and ages ranged from 34-48 years (mean: 43). Follow-up on the 3 patients ranged from 3-18 months (mean: 11 months). There has been no evidence of recurrence to date. The gingiva remucosalized uneventfully within several weeks, and all patients are tolerating solid food. All patients report dramatically improved speech, oral hygiene, and self-confidence. CONCLUSIONS: In an effort to address the high recurrence rate, we describe our aggressive surgical approach, including resection of the hypertrophied gingiva and alveolar processes. Two-staged gingival resection, as opposed to the more traditional 4-stage quadrantectomy approach, has resulted in no recurrence to date, suggesting an improved outcome over the traditional techniques."
"Intraabdominal or mesenteric fibromatosis is a rare benign nonmetastatic neoplasm that appears as a sporadic lesion or in patients with familiar polyposis. Its evolution is unpredictable. About 10% of the cases shaw a very aggressive growth. CASE REPORT: We presented a 22-year-old woman in whom an aggressive intraabdominal fibromatosis had appeared during the first pregnancy as a well circumscribed ovoid tumor, involving the terminal ileum, the caecum, the ascending colon, the right kidney, the ureter, and the right common iliac artery. The tumor was excised with right colectomy, nephroureterectomy and resection of the involved artery using arterial reconstruction with graft interposition. Two years after the surgery the patient developed an inoperable tumor recurrency with a fatal outcome. CONCLUSION: In spite of a successful surgical excision during the original surgery intraabdominal or mesenteric fibromatosis might have an aggressive evolution leading to an inoperable tumor recurrency and a fatal outcome."
"Desmoid tumors (aggressive fibromatosis) are rare neoplastic tumors that may occur sporadically or in association with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). The etiology of these tumors is unknown, but hormonal, genetic, and physical factors play a role in their development and growth. A distinction is often made between desmoids in patients with FAP and those in patients without FAP, but clinically these tumors are treated the same; the only difference is the preferential intra-abdominal location of FAP desmoids. The goal of desmoid treatment is local control. Choosing the appropriate method for achieving local control may be complex as the functional and cosmetic outcomes of each method must be considered. In addition, because desmoids spontaneously regress, any claim of successful intervention must be viewed skeptically. Local control is mainly achieved by surgical intervention and may be improved with the addition of radiation therapy (RT). For patients who cannot undergo surgery, the options for local control include RT and systemic therapies such as hormones, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), interferon, and chemotherapy. Patients with symptomatic, progressive disease who can tolerate chemotherapy should be presented with the option of low-dose or standard antisarcoma chemotherapy. Although it is unclear which regimen is better, patients appear to have quicker responses to the standard antisarcoma therapy. Hormone therapy, NSAIDs, and interferon are used often, with varying success, and should be reserved for minimally symptomatic patients or for patients who do not want or are not candidates for chemotherapy. The treatment of desmoid tumors remains an enigma. As more options become available, selecting the correct therapy becomes more nuanced. Further clinical trials are needed to help the clinician navigate his or her way through the morass of desmoid tumor therapies."
"The tumors of chest wall can be responsible of large full-thickness defects. The skeletal stabilization by different synthetic materials with numerous modalities of use and the superficial coverage of the defect by a musculocutaneous flap are the two imperatives parts of this reconstruction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1997 to January 2006, 14 patients, 10 males and 4 females, aged between 17 and 63 years old and suffering from full-thickness chest wall defects secondary to tumor resection have benefited from a simple reconstruction, wherever the defect, by a Mersilene Mesh and a muscular or musculocutaneous flap. These defects measured between 8 x 12 cm and 14 x 16 cm and were located in the anterior part of the chest in 3 cases, with resection of the upper half of the sternum and the internal part of both clavicles and the first three ribs, and in the lateral part of the chest in 11 cases with resection between 3 and 5 ribs. The histological diagnoses of these tumors were 3 chondrosarcomas, 3 sternum and 1 rib metastases, 2 desmoid tumors, 1 Ewing's sarcoma, 4 benign tumors. The flaps used were pedicled in 13 cases and based on the latissimus dorsi muscle, the serratus muscle and the pectoralis major muscle; in 1 case, the latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap was free. RESULTS: The skeletal stabilisation seems satisfying. There was no problems with the pulmonary function except in 4 cases where a dyspnea appears in sustained effort. No vascular complication on these flaps was noted. With a mean follow up of 46 months, there was no local recurrence of the malignant tumors. Two patients were deceased 1 year after surgery.0. CONCLUSION: The Mersilene mesh associated with a locoregional musculocutaneous flap represent a simple and efficient solution for the treatment of such defects."

"This rare entity is characterized by multiple nodular lesions largely composed of collagen-forming spindle cells and involving the subcutis, skeletal muscle, bone and viscera of newborns and infants that occurs in either a solitary or multicentric form. The clinical course of a case is presented. The patient is a 2-year-old male who was brought to our hospital because of a large cervical mass. On physical examination a firm, subcutaneous, immobile painless mass measuring 4.5x6 cm was palpated at right side of neck. After the first admission, 13 complete surgical resections were performed. This patient is the eleventh familial case in the literature. The patient died 10 years after the first surgery."
"Aggressive fibromatosis, usually termed desmoid tumor, develops from muscle connective tissue, fasciae and aponeuroses. Aggressive fibromatosis located in various parts of the body demonstrates differentiated biological behavior. Abnormalities in TGF-beta expression are very common in many disease processes, including neoplasms. Immunohistochemical analysis employing a monoclonal antibody against TGF-beta was performed on archival material, consisting of 38 cases of aggressive fibromatosis, among which 23 represented abdominal, 11 extra-abdominal and 4 intra-abdominal localizations. The sections for immunohistochemical study were stained using the streptavidin-biotin (ABC) method. The average percentage of cells positively stained for TGF-beta protein was 40.2% in the group of extra-abdominal, 58.5% in the group of abdominal and 72.8% in the group of intra-abdominal localizations. There were significant differences observed between the analyzed groups of desmoid tumor (p<0.05). A positive cytoplasmic reaction for TGF-beta was noted in 65.8% (25/38) of the aggressive fibromatoses. Overexpression of TGF-beta protein was noted in 39.5% (15/38) of the aggressive fibromatoses. High expression noticed in desmoid fibroblasts might indicate that this protein plays a crucial role in the development of aggressive fibromatosis."
"Chest wall desmoid tumors (DT) are rare pathologic entities with microscopic features similar to, or undistinguishable from, fibromas or fibrosarcomas. From 1996 to 2001, four patients with DT were surgically managed in our department. Their ages ranged from 27 years to 43 years (mean 32.25 years, median 29.5 years). A resection of the lesion was performed with negative margins of 4 cm around the tumor (wide resection). A reconstruction of the chest wall was also performed with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in 2 patients and methylmethacrolate with Marlex mesh in 1 patient. One patient had a recurrence 15 months later, and was admitted for complementary resection, and remains disease-free for 5 years. The rest 3 patients are disease-free for 6 months to 5 years. Resection must include all adjacent, overlying and underlying musculature as well as soft tissues and any spare skin from the procedure should be used. Prognosis after a wide resection is good."
"Fibromatosis of the breast is a benign but locally aggressive neoplasm, which has been described under various names including extra-abdominal desmoid tumour and aggressive fibromatosis. It is a rare condition, accounting for approximately 0.2% of all solid tumours of the breast. Clinically and radiologically the lesion mimics breast cancer and the definitive diagnosis is provided by histology. A high risk of local recurrence is a characteristic of this disease. Radical excision of the tumour with clear histological margins decreases the likelihood of recurrence. The possible association between breast implants and mammary fibromatosis has been reported. In this study we report a case of giant fibromatosis of the breast observed in a young patient and its extensive recurrence, involving all quadrants of the breast, the pectoralis major muscle, the rectus abdominis muscle sheath and the costal layer. The main clinical and pathological characteristics of this rare disease are illustrated, emphasizing the difficulties encountered both in the diagnosis of the primary lesion and in the management of its giant recurrence, particularly as regards the possibility of obtaining a radical surgical excision and the option of performing breast reconstruction."
"Desmoid tumours are rare neoplasms of fibroblastic origin which arise with disproportionate frequency in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). They are thought to develop in about 10-25% of FAP patients and may be the leading cause of death amongst those who have undergone colectomy. Risk factors include trauma, having a distal germline APC mutation, having a family history of desmoids, and probably oestrogens. In very high-risk individuals there may be a case for delay of colectomy or chemoprophylaxis at the time of surgery. Desmoids are now known to be true neoplasms but with normal telomere length and telomerase activity. FAP-associated tumours seem to carry biallelic APC mutations, one of which lies in the distal part of the gene. Such loss of wild-type APC seems to occur relatively late in tumour development. It is likely that beta-catenin plays an important role in tumourigenesis. FAP-associated desmoids tend to arise in the abdomen or abdominal wall. CT scanning gives the best information on tumour anatomy whilst T2-weighted MRI indicates likely behaviour. Treatment may simply consist of observation. Otherwise, usual first-line therapy is with sulindac with or without an anti-oestrogen. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is an option in unresectable tumours. Surgery is a reasonable first-line treatment in abdominal wall tumours but is risky for intra-abdominal tumours and may necessitate massive small bowel resection. Desmoids are the greatest remaining challenge in the management of FAP and further research into their aetiology needs to be combined with multicentre clinical trials of new treatments in order to improve management of the disease."
"Desmoid tumors are nonencapsulated, locally invasive tumors of fibrous origin. Although lacking the ability to metastasize, they are notorious for recurrence. A wide variety of locations have been documented in the literature with respect to the origin of these tumors. Intra-abdominal desmoids are commonly found in the mesentery. We present the report of a case in which a sporadic desmoid tumor originated from the wall of the ileum. The patient was successfully treated with surgery alone, and has remained recurrence free on follow-up. Modalities of treatment documented in the literature include surgery, nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs such as sulindac, and chemotherapeutic drugs such as vinblastine and methotrexate, radiotherapy, and, recently, tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as Imatinib (gleevec). Of all the options described, surgery with tumor-free margins has been defined as the best treatment modality."
"The purpose of this study was to characterize the anatomic appearance and metabolic activity of nonossifying fibromas, fibrous cortical defects, and cortical desmoids on PET/CT images. CONCLUSION: Over a 14-month period, we identified eight nonossifying fibromas, four fibrous cortical defects, and two cortical desmoids in 330 children who underwent PET/CT for the evaluation of a known or suspected malignancy. CT, conventional radiography, MRI, or clinical follow-up was used to confirm the diagnoses of these fibroosseous lesions. Eleven of the 14 children underwent multiple PET/CT examinations; thus, 34 studies were included. The lesions showed variable metabolic activity as indicated by 18F-FDG uptake: 19 PET/CT examinations showed lesions with mild 18F-FDG uptake, eight showed moderate 18F-FDG uptake, and seven showed intense uptake. When PET reveals metabolically active osseous abnormalities in children who are at risk for bone metastases, benign fibroosseous lesions should be considered in the differential diagnosis before additional diagnostic procedures are undertaken. Benign fibroosseous lesions may be metabolically active and thus mimic metastatic osseous disease in children with underlying malignancies. Correlative CT or other anatomic imaging can confirm the benign nature of these lesions."
"[corrected] Desmoid tumors are rare benign tumors but have a tendency toward local recurrence after resection because of their infiltrative growth and frequent entrapment of vital structures in the head and neck region. We report 24 desmoid tumors of the head and neck and propose a reasonable approach in the management of such cases. METHODS: Twenty-four patients (9 male and 15 female; median age, 33 years; range, 0-66 years) with a desmoid tumor of the head and neck (neck, 15 patients; head, 9 patients) treated from 1990 to 2004 were retrospectively analyzed. The size ranged from 0.5 to 13 cm in diameter (mean, 3.6 cm). In the neck, 8 tumors were around the superficial layer of deep cervical fascia, whereas 4 tumors of the neck involved the prevertebral fascia and 2 involved brachial plexus. RESULTS: Twenty patients received complete resection of the tumor, but the section margin was positive in 8 patients, of which 6 patients remained free of disease in a period of 13 to 105 months. Three patients, including 2 with positive section margin and 1 with negative margin, developed recurrences, which were successfully removed again. Two patients underwent partial resection of the tumor because of brachial plexus involvement. One of them achieved regression after postoperative radiotherapy and the other had spontaneous regression. The hypopharygneal tumor in a newborn had spontaneously complete regression, and tracheostomy was closed at the age of 6 years. One patient remained with stable disease for 14 months after biopsy of the tumor without excision. CONCLUSION: The overall prognosis is still good despite frequent incomplete resection. Surgical resection of the tumor with close observation is suggested even if the section margin is positive. If a desmoid tumor cannot be removed grossly, regression or arrested growth of the remaining tumor is expected. Radiotherapy might be reserved for a growing tumor."
"A 66-year-old woman had a recurrent desmoid tumor in the right thoracic apex. The tumor infiltrated the brachial plexus and eventually rendered the upper right extremity functionless. The tumor was removed by aggressive wide resection of the right upper hemithorax with simultaneous amputation of the functionless right arm. Reconstruction of the chest wall was accomplished, utilizing the soft tissues of the remnant arm as a pedicled flap to cover the full-thickness defect. Aggressive wide resection of the chest wall with limb amputation is technically challenging but unavoidable in some cases of recurrent desmoid tumor."
"Desmoid tumours affect 10-25 per cent of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Surgery for intra-abdominal desmoids has traditionally been used as a last resort or to manage obstructive complications. The aim was to review 10 years of desmoid surgery in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis from a single centre. METHODS: Patients who had surgery for desmoid disease between 1994 and 2004 were identified from the Polyposis Registry database and their hospital notes reviewed. RESULTS: Twenty patients had surgery to remove 32 desmoid tumours (16 intra-abdominal, 12 abdominal wall, four extra-abdominal). Complete clearance was achieved in 19 tumours and, of these, clinically significant recurrence occurred in eight. There was no difference in recurrence rates for site or sex. There was no operative mortality. Intra-abdominal desmoid resection was associated with a mean resection of 45.55 (range 10-200) cm of small bowel. One patient required long-term parenteral feeding. Median follow-up was 5 (range 0.6-10) years. During this period, one patient died (metastatic duodenal cancer); there was no mortality from desmoid disease. CONCLUSION: Surgery for intra-abdominal desmoids in selected patients is less hazardous than previously reported. Surgery for abdominal wall and extra-abdominal tumours is safe. However, disease recurrence remains a major problem."

"A diagnosis of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) remains problematic because of its bland-looking histologic features that can be potentially confused with other benign or low-grade fibromyxoid lesions. Recent cytogenetic and molecular analyses have shown that most LGFMSs have a characteristic chromosomal abnormality, t(7;16)(q33;p11), resulting in the FUS-CREB3L2 fusion gene. However, such assays have only rarely been used to analyze formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples. In the present study, we conducted a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay to detect the FUS-CREB3L2 fusion transcripts using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue specimens from 16 LGFMSs including 3 cases with giant collagen rosettes. The primers were newly designed to specifically amplify most of the junctional regions of the FUS-CREB3L2 fusion gene transcripts previously reported. The FUS-CREB3L2 fusion gene transcripts were detected in 14/16 (88%) cases of LGFMS. A nucleotide sequence analysis of the PCR products revealed that different portions of the FUS exon 6 or 7 were fused with various sites of the CREB3L2 exon 5, resulting in 12 different nucleotide sequences. We also tested a primer set to detect the FUS-CREB3L1 fusion transcript, which is a rare variant of the gene fusion in LGFMS, although no PCR products were identified in any case. The FUS-CREB3L2 fusion transcripts were not detected in any of the 123 other soft-tissue tumors, including desmoid-type fibromatoses, myxofibrosarcomas, soft-tissue perineuriomas, and congenital or adult fibrosarcomas. These data suggest that our reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay is a reliable method to detect FUS-CREB3L2, which can thus help in accurately diagnosing LGFMS."
"Fibromatosis or desmoid tumor of the breast is an extremely rare entity. While it lacks a metastatic potential, it can grow aggressively in a locally infiltrating pattern. The failure to recognize this as a finite entity within the breast can lead to local recurrence after incomplete excision. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 70 year old patient with a remote history of invasive breast cancer (treated twelve years earlier by lumpectomy, axillary lymph node dissection, postoperative radiation therapy, and five years of tamoxifen) who developed fibromatosis within another quadrant of the same breast that clinically, mammographically, and sonographically mimicked that of the development of an ipsilateral metachronous breast cancer. After the initial diagnosis of fibromatosis was made on a minimally invasive ultrasound guided biopsy, it was successfully treated by wide local excision. CONCLUSION: After appropriate recognition, wide local excision can be the appropriate surgical management strategy for fibromatosis of the breast."
"Fibromatosis is a locally aggressive, proliferative fibroblastic lesion affecting musculoaponeurotic structures, most often in the limbs and trunk. Intracranial fibromatosis is extremely rare and requires aggressive treatment to prevent recurrence. CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a 20 year old woman with aggressive skull base fibromatosis. The lesion extended through the sphenoid, ethmoid sinus and nasal cavity, destroying the right roof of the orbit and penetrating in anterior skull base. A combined anterior craniofacial approach was performed; complete resection with surgical margin was impossible due to the localization of the tumor and relation to important neurovascular structures. Complete resection with surgical margin is often impossible because of its widely infiltrative nature. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are often required to improve local control of the lesion."
"Constitutive activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is a hallmark of many cancers, including familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)-related desmoid tumors. Endostatin is a well-known antiangiogenic protein that has been described recently as a potential inhibitor of this signaling pathway. Here, we show that endostatin directly induces apoptosis and inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway in colorectal cancer cell lines bearing mutations on the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene as a model of FAP-related malignant cells. We then explore the relationship between apoptosis and inhibition of this pathway and show that they are not correlated. These results seem to contradict a well-recognized study, showing that reintroduction of the APC cDNA in APC-deficient cells leads to apoptosis. To reconcile our conclusions with the literature, we further show that a truncated fragment of APC capable of inhibiting the Wnt signaling pathway in SW480 cells is incapable of inducing apoptosis in these cells, confirming that APC-mediated apoptosis is uncoupled to the inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway. Finally, we show that endostatin directly induces cell death on primary FAP-related desmoid tumor cells in culture. This phenomenon is also independent of the inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway. Considering the current lack of effective treatment against desmoid tumors, we advocate that endostatin gene therapy represents an attractive new therapeutic approach for this disease."
"A 69-year-old male who developed a desmoid tumor at the site of his end colostomy after abdominoperineal resection for rectal carcinoma is reported. The tumor was resected with wide margins. Histopathology revealed desmoid tumor of the anterior abdominal wall with no malignant features. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course. To our knowledge, this is the first case of solitary desmoid tumor of anterior abdominal wall at the colostomy site reported in the literature."

"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by multiple colorectal adenomas that can progress to carcinoma. FAP can be associated with diverse extracolonic manifestation, including desmoid tumors and adrenal masses. We report our experience with a patient diagnosed of FAP, who developed a desmoid tumor and an adrenal mass in the follow-up. To our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature in which a hypersecretion of aldosterone and cortisol in the adrenal mass of a patient diagnosed of FAP has been demonstrated."
"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an inherited condition causing numerous adenomatous colorectal polyps and a markedly elevated risk of colon cancer. FAP may be associated with various extracolonic manifestations such as desmoid fibromatosis and osteomas (termed Gardner's syndrome) and brain tumors, usually medulloblastoma or glioma [termed Brain Tumor Polyposis (BTP) syndrome type 2]. We describe a pediatric patient who initially presented with prolactinoma and later was found to have Gardner's syndrome. A germline mutation of the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) gene was identified. Our case illustrates the association between prolactinoma and FAP, which may represent a rare subtype of Gardner's and BTP syndromes."

"Intra-thoracic desmoid tumours with mediastinal invasion are very rare. Although rare they have to be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of a thoracic mass and therapeutic options have to be weighted since surgical treatment may require wide excision. CASE PRESENTATION: A 48-year-old male diabetic, dyslipidaemic, former heavy smoker with psychiatric illness was operated by sternotomy for a triple aorto-coronary bypass 4 years before, presented with complains of recent onset such as constant and oppressive chest pain. At surgery a mass extending from the aortic arch into the entire anterior mediastinum and to most of the right pleural cavity was found. The mass was separated from sternal periosteum and vessels of aorto-coronary by pass were isolated starting from the aortic arch up to the pericardium. The histological examination revealed aggressive fibromatosis. CONCLUSION: Although technically demanding, radical surgical excision is actually the most indicated therapeutic approach for intra-thoracic desmoid tumours."

"Colorectal cancer is rare in childhood. The 2 best characterized familial syndromes, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, Lynch syndrome) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), are autosomal dominant inherited disorders. HNPCC is relevant to pediatric gastroenterology practice because children and adolescents with underlying colorectal cancer can have germ-line mutations of mismatch repair genes. Recent attention has focused on characterizing genetic predisposition to attenuated FAP in individuals who do not have germ-line mutations in the APC gene. The identification of a second mechanistic explanation called MYH-associated polyposis (MAP), which is an autosomal-recessive condition, has important implications for both screening and management strategies. Hereditary colorectal cancer including HNPCC, FAP, attenuated FAP and MYH-associated polyposis in children are the subject of this review."
"The tensor fascia lata is a versatile flap with many uses in reconstructive plastic surgery. As a pedicled flap its reach to the lower abdomen and groin made it an attractive option for reconstructing soft tissue defects after tumor ablation. However, debate exists on the safe dimension of the flap, as distal tip necrosis is common. Also, the adequacy of the fascia lata as a sole substitute for abdominal wall muscles has been disputable. The aim of the current study is to report our experience and clinical observations with this flap in reconstructing those challenging defects and to discuss the possible options to minimize the latter disputable issues. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From April 2001 to April 2004, 12 pedicled TFL flaps were used to reconstruct 5 central abdominal wall full thickness defects and 6 groin soft tissue defects following tumor resection. In one case, bilateral flaps were used to reconstruct a large central abdominal wall defect. There were 4 males and 7 females. Their age ranged from 19 to 60. From the abdominal wall defects group, all repairs were enforced primarily with a prolene mesh except for one patient who was the first in this study. Patients presenting with groin defects required coverage of exposed vessels following tumor resection. All patients in the current study underwent immediate reconstruction. RESULTS: The resulting soft tissue defects in this study were due to resection of 4 abdominal wall desmoid tumors, a colonic carcinoma infiltrating the abdominal wall, 4 primary groin soft tissue sarcomas, a metastatic SCC of the leg to groin nodes, and a primary SCC of the groin. The size of the flaps used ranged from 20 x 10 cm to 31 x 18 cm. All flaps survived. However, distal flap necrosis occurred in 4 cases. Three of those cases developed in flaps reconstructing abdominal wall defects, and one case developed in a flap used to cover a groin defect. In the former 3 cases, the flap was simply transposed without complete islanding of the flap. In the latter case, a very large flap was harvested beyond the safe limits with its distal edge just above the knee. In addition, wound dehiscence of the flap occurred in 2 other cases from the groin 132 group. Nevertheless, all the wounds healed spontaneously with repeated dressings. Out of the 5 cases that underwent abdominal wall reconstruction, one case developed ventral hernia, in which bilateral TFL flaps were used without mesh enforcement. There was minimal donor site morbidity in the form of partial skin graft loss in 2 cases. The average follow up period in this study ranged from 6 months to 2 years. Only one patient died of distant metastasis of a SCC of the groin skin, 8 months postoperatively and another 2 patients with abdominal desmoid tumors developed local recurrence. CONCLUSION: The tensor fascia lata flap is a reliable and a versatile flap, with minimal donor site morbidity. Problems with the flap's vascularity of its distal part should not be encountered, if the flap is harvested within the safe limits and properly designed and the edges comfortably insetted to the defect. A pedicled flap would be appropriate for lower abdominal wall defects, and is better islanded to achieve extra mobilization and allow a tension free closure, while for groin defects, simple flap transposition should be enough. Nevertheless, reconstruction for full thickness abdominal wall defects by this flap is a static reconstruction. We therefore strongly recommend enforcing the repair with a synthetic mesh primarily to minimize the incidence of ventral hernia. However, further studies with larger number of cases are needed to confirm this observation."

"Intra-abdominal fibromatosis or desmoid tumors are rare forms of connective tissue cellular dysplasia characterized by proliferation of fibroblasts and abundant collagen. Most often these tumors associated with familial adenomatous polyposis or Gardner's syndrome. Those tumors not associated with polyposis are termed sporadic desmoids and tend to be locally aggressive in nature. Sporadic intra-abdominal desmoids involving the pancreas are quite rare, as only six previously reported cases exist. In this report we present a seventh case of a sporadic intraabdominal desmoid involving the pancreas. The patient, a 63-year-old white man, developed the desmoid tumor following a pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy for an insulinoma. The patient was managed via further pancreatectomy, consisting of a distal pancreatectomy with en bloc splenectomy, sparing a 6-cm portion of pancreatic neck and proximal body. Finally, we present a complete review of the six previous cases of sporadic pancreatic fibromatosis."
"Fibromatosis or desmoid tumor is a rare soft tissue tumor that lacks a metastatic potential, but is characterized by a locally aggressive and infiltrating growth pattern and a high propensity toward local recurrence if incompletely excised. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a patient with three post-surgical recurrences of fibromatosis of the breast over a seven year period. The fibromatosis was found to be involving the chest wall musculature and causing persistent and worsening pain. An aggressive operative strategy was undertaken, consisting of mastectomy with en bloc resection of the underlying chest wall musculature, ribs, and parietal pleura. CONCLUSION: Aggressive surgical management of fibromatosis of the breast with suspected chest wall involvement is appropriate to attempt to obtain a long-term durable cure."
"Infantile fibromatosis represents the childhood counter part of musculoaponeurotic fibromatosis & arises as a solitary mass in skeletal muscle, adjacent fascia, aponeurosis or periosteum. The lesion is extremely rare. Microscopically it exists in two forms diffuse (mesenchymal) & desmoid. The less common desmoid form rarely occurs in infancy. Immunophenotype shows vimentin positivity with variable positivity with muscle markers. The differential diagnosis of this type is infantile fibrosarcoma. The tumor may locally recur if inadequately excised. We report a case of infantile fibromatosis of desmoid type occurring in 10 months male child for its extreme rarity."
"Desmoid tumor is a rare entity, and most desmoid tumors are located in abdominal wall or extra-abdominal tissues. Occurrence of desmoid tumor in mesentry is extremely rare. CASE PRESENTATION: we report a mesenteric desmoid tumor in a 73-years-old woman who had undergone total gastrectomy reconstructed with jejunal pouch interposition for gastric carcinoma. After 1 year, a tumor was originating from mesentery of the interposed jejunal pouch was identified, and the patient underwent resection of the large mass which was found to invade pancreas. Histological examination revealed desmoid tumor. CONCLUSION: Desmoid tumor is rare, and it was difficult for the differential diagnosis of desmoid tumor or recurrent tumor."
"extra-abdominal in the area of the shoulder and pelvic girdle or chest and neck wall; abdominal in abdominal wall muscles; intra-abdominal concerning pelvis, mesentery connective tissue or retroperitoneal space. Desmoid tumor is a neoplasm which rarely turns malignant and is non-metastasizing but demonstrates ability to local infiltration into tissue and is characterized by high risk of recurrence (25-65%) after surgical treatment. Desmoid tumor etiology is uncertain. This neoplasm occurs in sporadic (idiopathic) form and is also associated with some familial neoplastic syndromes. Most sporadic cases of aggressive fibromatosis contain a somatic mutation in either the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) or beta-catenin genes. Sporadic tumors are more frequent in women than in men from 2 : 1 to 5 : 1. In about 10-15 per cent of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), aggressive fibromatosis is a parenteral manifestation of this familial syndrome conditioned by APC gene mutation. Abdomen injury--most frequently due to surgery is said to play an important role in the initiation of fibrous tissue proliferative process in the cases of abdominal and intra abdominal forms. High cells growth potential with relatively high local malignancy is observed in about 10% of cases with sporadic tumors as well as in those FAP-associated."
"Desmoid tumors occur with high frequency in individuals with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP). Because of this, individuals developing desmoid tumors may be referred for genetic risk assessment. Determining whether a person has a FAP-related desmoid tumor or a sporadic desmoid can be challenging. We sought to characterize the patients who were seen at our institution to determine if there were clinical differences in presentation between FAP-associated and sporadic desmoid tumors. We searched the Mayo Clinic-modified H-ICDA (Hospital adaptation of the International Classification of Diseases) diagnostic codes for all diagnoses of desmoid tumors in patients seen between 1976 and 1999. Charts were reviewed to determine accuracy of diagnosis, age when seen, gender, site of tumor, and presence of polyposis. A total of 454 patients (174 males and 280 females) met the search criterion. Of the 447 patients on whom all data was obtained, 70 had FAP and 377 had no evidence of FAP. The female/male ratio for FAP cases was 1.12 compared to female/male ratio of 1.71 for non-FAP cases. (P=0.17). Location of development of desmoid tumors was correlated with but not specific for distinguishing FAP from non-FAP desmoids. Abdominal desmoids comprised the majority of FAP desmoids and extra-abdominal desmoids comprised the majority of non-FAP desmoids (P<0.001) but age was not a discriminating factor. Using Bayesian analysis, we demonstrate how these findings can assist genetic professionals in their evaluation of patients with desmoid tumors by providing prior probabilities of FAP based upon clinical presentation."
"immunocytochemistry, immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and two-color Western blot detection with the Odyssey infrared imaging system. Through this comparative analysis, Western blot with Odyssey was recognized as the best method to analyze the expression particularly of low expressed proteins in desmoid-derived cells. The use of a specific and reliable assessment method becomes fundamental in the evaluation of the presence and modulation of proteins which are important but weakly expressed in these rare tumors."
"Dramatic advances in the understanding of the genetic basis for inherited diseases and in diagnosis and treatment are particularly applicable to intestinal polyposis. Recent contributions have impacted our understanding of the molecular basis for the disease and improved our ability to treat them. RECENT FINDINGS: Insights into the genetic basis of the spectrum of disease and refinement of genetic screening, diagnostic tests, and surgical management of intestinal polyposis and extraintestinal manifestations are reviewed. SUMMARY: Our understanding of the genetic basis for the intestinal polyposis syndromes remains incomplete, but recent studies have contributed to filling in significant gaps in our knowledge. Specific genetic alterations have been identified in the majority of the 30% of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis that do not test positive for mutations in the APC gene with routine testing. A novel gene ENG has been identified in a subgroup of patients with Peutz-Jegher's syndrome and a hypothesis has been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of the mucosal defects. Technological advancements in diagnosis and treatment include the use of capsule endoscopy for screening and the minimally invasive approach to total colectomy with ileoanal pullthrough. Treatment of desmoid tumors remains a challenge, but new chemotherapy regimens show some promise in treating this rare, but devastating, extraintestinal manifestation."
"Mesenteric fibromatosis is a proliferative fibroblastic neoplasia of the small intestine mesentery that may occur as a unique or multiple formation. Mesenteric fibromatosis is a rare, locally aggressive neoplasm and may present with abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, weight loss, or symptoms of ureteral obstruction, mesenteric ischemia, or intestinal obstruction. It is of the utmost importance to distinguish mesenteric fibromatosis from gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Histopathology accurately differentiates between these two distinct entities. The preferred treatment is local surgical excision with a margin of uninvolved tissue. The involvement of important structures like the superior mesenteric artery and the superior mesenteric vein may pose a challenge during resection, but these tumors can be excised and the vessels repaired primarily."
"Desmoid-type fibromatoses are a locally invasive soft-tissue lesion that is most commonly encountered in abdominal sites. The tumor also affects head and neck areas, particularly the supraclavicular region, where it may encase and distort the brachial plexus and compromise neurovascular structures. Neurosurgeons may be called on to treat desmoid-type fibromatoses in these sites. The authors describe their experience in treating four patients with desmoid-type fibromatoses involving the brachial plexus and report the results of immunohistochemical analysis of the tumors. METHODS: Gross-total excision with nerve sparing was the first-line therapy of choice, although the surgery was challenging. Intraoperative identification of the site of tumor origin from musculoaponeurotic tissues by the neurosurgeon was necessary in two of the four cases to achieve a correct frozen section or final pathological diagnosis. Immunostaining for c-KIT (CD117) was undertaken in all cases in light of a previous report of positive CD117 immunoreactivity in abdominal desmoid-type fibromatoses. All four tumors manifested weak focal immunostaining for c-KIT. One of the patients was given adjuvant imatinib mesylate therapy, with limited success. Subsequent polymerase chain reaction testing revealed that three of the four tumors manifested a single base pair change in exon 10 of the c-KIT gene (A to C in two cases and A to G in one case). There was local recurrence in three patients, despite gross-total excision. With the combination of surgery and radiation therapy, local disease control was achieved in three of the four patients. CONCLUSIONS: This represents the first report of c-KIT sequencing in desmoid-type fibromatoses and suggests a possible biological basis for continuing to explore the use of adjuvant imatinib mesylate therapy."

"Since their initial description in 1832, desmoid tumors have been reported to occur in virtually every part of the body. Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors, or mesenteric fibromatosis, are often associated with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis mutation in a syndrome known as Gardner's Syndrome. Although sporadic cases of desmoid tumors do occur, unlike Gardner's Syndrome, they predominantly occur extra-abdominally. CASE: Case report of a 61-year-old female who presented with two months of abdominal pain, progressive lower abdominal distension and a 10-15 pound weight gain accompanied by one week of urinary hesitancy and frequency. Patient underwent a diagnostic workup for an ovarian neoplasm, but was found at surgery to have mesentric fibromatosis. CONCLUSION: Although uncommon, mesentric fibromatosis must be considered in the differential diagnosis when evaluating a patient with an abdominal mass of unknown origin."
"Heterozygous germline DNA mismatch repair gene mutations are typically associated with HNPCC. Here we report the case of a proband whose father was known for familial adenomatous polyposis. The number of polyps (less than ten) was not typical of polyposis; therefore, the diagnosis of HNPCC was entertained. Microsatellite instability analyses were performed on peripheral blood and biopsy of a right-sided dysplastic adenoma. The tumor tissue showed high-grade instability, and a subsequent, immunohistochemistry showed that neither MSH2 nor MSH6 proteins were expressed in tumor cells. Prophylactic colectomy was performed, and an adenocarcinoma developing within the adenoma was diagnosed (pT1N0). Genomic DNA analysis revealed a novel mutation in MSH2 as a frameshift mutation in exon 7 (c.1191_1192dupG). Both parents of the proband were analysed for MSH2 and APC mutations, and in the father, a truncating mutation in exon 15 of APC was identified as del3471-3473GAGA. This mutation was found to be present in the proband. His mother was found to bear the MSH2 exon 7 mutation. At the follow-up, the proband was diagnosed with fundic, antral and duodenal adenomas (one fundic adenoma showed low-grade dysplasia). Several tubular rectal adenomas with low-grade dysplasia were excised. The patient later developed an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor."

"Desmoid tumors are histologically benign but locally invasive tumors that can occur in the head and neck. We present the rare case of a desmoid tumor that occurred in the surgical corridor after suboccipital craniotomy for recurrent low-grade astrocytoma. A 30-year-old woman underwent a repeat suboccipital craniotomy for recurrent low-grade astrocytoma. A gross total resection was achieved. Nine months later, a firm, palpable mass was noted near the surgical scar. No new neurologic deficits were noted on exam. A magnetic resonance imaging scan demonstrated a homogeneously enhancing lesion superficial to the dural graft. Surgical resection of the lesion was performed through the original midline incision. The mass was resected en bloc. Histology demonstrated clear surgical margins and a tumor of low cellularity consistent with a desmoid tumor. Desmoid tumors should be considered in the differential diagnosis for superficial masses occurring in the surgical bed after posterior cervical surgery."
"Fibrous hamartoma (FH) of infancy is a benign mesenchymal tumor, occurring as a superficial mass. Complete excision is curative. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: The clinical features and treatment results of 18 children with FH are described. RESULTS: Local excision was the most common procedure. Surgery was radical in 10 patients, with microscopic residual disease in 6; all of them are alive with no evidence of disease 2 to 49 months after diagnosis. One patient, treated with a local reexcision for macroscopic residual disease (and chemotherapy for a synchronous desmoid fibromatosis) is well 83 months after diagnosis; the last patient, with a lesion of the labia majora, only underwent biopsy and is doing well, awaiting plastic surgery. LIMITATIONS: The results did not reach statistical significance due to difficulties in collecting cases. CONCLUSIONS: FH should be treated by complete excision; in our experience a nonradical excision was also able to achieve the cure. An aggressive approach should be avoided, as the overall prognosis is excellent."
"To study the clinicopathological and genetic features of desmoid-type fibromatosis, and to investigate the feasibility of detecting trisomy 8 in formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). METHODS: A total of 96 cases were included in this study. All patients had clinical information. Histopathologic and immunohistochemical evaluations were available in 69 cases, and ultrastructural evaluation was done in 2 cases of desmoid-type fibromatosis. FFPE tissue sections were available in 20 tumors for the trisomy 8 detection by FISH. RESULTS: There were 20 male and 76 female patients with ages ranging from 8 to 86 years (mean 35.3 years). Clinically, there were 44 extra-abdominal tumors, 28 abdominal wall tumors and 23 intra-abdominal lesions mostly involving the mesentery. Most cases presented with nodular or funicular masses with white firm cut surfaces, measuring 0.6 to 24.0 cm (mean 8.4 cm) in size. Histologically, desmoid-type fibromatoses showed longitudinal fascicles of spindle fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in a predominantly collagenous background. The tumor cells stained positive for vimentin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, desmin, and beta-catenin (47.8%, 33/69). Ultrastructurally, most tumor cells had features of fibroblasts, including rich endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Some tumor cells were myofibroblast-like cells exhibiting intercellular junctions, fibronexous junctions and stress fibers. Trisomy 8 was detected in 6 of 20 cases of desmoid-type fibromatosis including 5 of the 8 recurrent tumors but only one of the 12 primary tumors. The latter tumor also recurred three years later. CONCLUSIONS: Desmoid-type fibromatosis is an intermediate (locally aggressive) tumor that occurs predominantly in young females. The lesion consists of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts with the latter showing characteristic features including stress fibers and fibronexous junctions. Trisomy 8 can be detected in FFPE tissue by FISH, and its presence serves as a useful predictor of tumor recurrence and may define a subtype of desmoid-type fibromatosis with high recurrence rate."
"Extra-abdominal aggressive fibromatosis is a benign fibroblastic neoplasia with an infiltrative nature and a high tendency of local recurrence. Here, we report on a very rare case of multicentric fibromatosis. Low complaints led to considerable size of the tumours. The aim of the multimodal treatment was a limb salvage procedure. Adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy was necessary because of the renunciation of wide resections in favour of the functionality of the limb."
"We present a rare case of a desmoid tumour presenting with perforation of the small bowel. Although desmoid is classified pathologically as a benign tumour, its infiltrative nature leads to a locally aggressive mass, which can invade surrounding structures and organs making surgical resection difficult. Some unresectable tumours show oestrogen receptor positive cells and can be managed with tamoxifen. The aetiology, investigation and management options are briefly described."
"We report a case of a young woman with recurrent desmoid tumor. Computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest showed a large mass in the left chest wall. The tumor was unresectable because of the involvement of adjacent structures. Tamoxifen therapy led to marked tumor regression within 3 months. She had preserved her fertility, and thereafter she conceived a baby. In young women with recurrent desmoid tumor, tamoxifen should be considered as the first choice of treatment."
"To determine the impact of prognostic variables on local control in patients with aggressive fibromatosis treated with or without radiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients presenting to the combined sarcoma clinic at Johannesburg Hospital with aggressive fibromatosis from 1990 to 2003 were analysed retrospectively. There were 14 males and 28 females. The lesions involved the head and neck in 6 cases (14%), the thorax in 6 (14%), the extremities in 19 (45%) and the abdomen in 11 (26%). Thirty-seven patients (88%) presented to the clinic for the first time, whereas 5 (12%) had recurrent disease at presentation. Fifteen patients (36%) underwent excision only, 15 (36%) had excision followed by postoperative radiation, 8 (19%) had biopsy only, and 4 (9%) had radiation only. The median dose of radiation was 60 Gy (range 9 - 70 Gy). RESULTS: One patient had local failure following excision and postoperative radiation therapy. The local control was 100% for surgery alone and 86% for surgery followed by postoperative radiation at > or = 24 months. On univariate analysis, age, sex, positive margins, primary or recurrent presentation, site of involvement and initial treatment did not affect local control significantly. Eight of 19 patients (42%) receiving radiation developed severe moist desquamation following treatment, and all these patients had doses of 60 Gy or more. CONCLUSION: Surgery with or without radiation therapy gave excellent local control. The addition of radiation therapy to surgery as well as other known prognostic parameters did not impact on local control. The morbidity of radiation treatment is considerable, as noted in this series, and adjuvant radiation therapy should therefore be considered only in situations where the risk of recurrence and the morbidity of re-excision are high."
"This 50-year-old woman presented with a paravertebral lumbar fibromatosis (desmoid tumor) after undergoing the placement of instrumentation for lumbar spondylolisthesis. The tumor developed just cranial to the previous skin incision. Fibromatoses, or desmoid tumors, are uncommon infiltrative lesions that affect musculoaponeurotic structures, most often of the trunk and limbs. They are known to occur in association with surgery-related scars or implants and only rare examples appear in the neurosurgical and spine-related literature. In cases involving well-defined tumors in which radical resection is possible, surgery is the treatment of choice; however, the recurrence rate is high. The patient in the present case was followed for 14 months postoperatively and did not undergo radiotherapy; there was no recurrence. Although rare, this distinctive tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis of postoperative paravertebral bulgings after neurosurgical and spinal operations."
"Gardner's syndrome can occasionally be complicated with intra-abdominal desmoid tumor. These tumors usually remain asymptomatic but can exhibit symptoms due to intestinal, vascular and ureteral compression and obstruction. CASE PRESENTATION: A rare case of a 41-year-old male patient with Gardner's syndrome complicated with intra-abdominal desmoid tumor, which first presented as acute abdomen, is presented. CONCLUSION: Extra-abdominal manifestations of Gardner's syndrome along with a palpable abdominal mass would raise suspicion for the presence of a desmoid tumor in the majority of cases. In life-threatening cases, surgical treatment should be considered as a palliative approach, though the extent of excision remains debatable."
"the cytological diagnosis was suspicious for an indeterminate (mesenchymal) neoplasm. Histological diagnosis, after extensive surgery, indicated aggressive fibromatosis. Immunohistochemistry was positive for vimentin and negative for thyroglobulin. After surgery, nuclear magnetic resonance showed a persistent mass of approximately 2 cm; dysphagia and pain persisted. Therefore, the patient received external radiation therapy (total dose 60 Gy) with clinical benefit. The patient is without symptoms 1 yr after surgery."
"Desmoplastic fibroma or desmoid bone tumor is a rare tumor described for the first time by Jaffe in 1958. It accounts for 0.1 to 0.3% of all benign bone tumors. To date, about 150 cases involving the locomotor system have been reported. Histology is required for certain diagnosis of desmoplastic fibroma. The tumor is composed of sparse fibroblasts in a rich background of collagen fibers, a histological presentation exactly the same as soft tissue desmoid fibroma. We report two new cases of desmoplastic fibroma of the locomotor system. The observations illustrate the radiological diagnosis. MRI was used to search for local extension in bone or soft tissues. Biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The histological presentation may be difficult to recognized and distinguish from low grade fibrosarcoma. After treatment, the rate of local recurrence is high in the event of partial resection. Surgery is the optimal treatment, with tumor resection as wide as possible depending on the localization."
A 3-year-old girl with desmoid tumor of the right orbit initially presented with a 4-month history of unilateral ptosis and was subsequentially found to have fullness of the right upper eyelid. Computed tomography of the orbit revealed a soft tissue density in the superolateral quadrant of the right orbit. Histopathology from a biopsy revealed a desmoid tumor with positive margins. The patient subsequently underwent compete excision of the tumor and is presently doing well.
"superficial and deep; the first is not aggressive whilst the second invades other tissues deeply. This is a case report of the deep variant of juvenile aggressive fibromatosis of the lateral mandible affecting a 24-month-old young female patient. The tumour has been treated surgically by resection of the mandible and reconstruction with a rib-graft. To by-passs resorption of the rib-graft and to re-establish the correct three-dimensional shape of the facial skeleton, osteodistraction of the reconstructed mandible was performed six months post-peratively. In this article the surgical techniques to reconstruct the mandible in young children are discussed."
"The authors studied the concordance among seven pathologists for the histologic diagnosis, interpretation of KIT immunostaining, and determining MIB-1 labeling indices (LI) in 80 adult patients with primary spindle cell tumors, mainly of the gastrointestinal tract, mesentery, retroperitoneum, and pelvis, based on the review of tissue sections using an immunohistochemical panel of antibodies for KIT/CD117, CD34, desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), and S-100 protein. Tumors included 30 gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), 10 leiomyomas, 10 leiomyosarcomas, 10 schwannomas, 10 solitary fibrous tumors, and 10 desmoid-type fibromatoses. The overall concordance with the original diagnosis of each histologic type was 97.9%, the kappa value ranging from 0.95 to 1.00 (mean 0.97), indicating a perfect agreement. The overall interlaboratory concordance with the original interpretation of KIT immunostaining was 91.3%, the kappa value ranging from 0.77 to 0.90 (mean 0.86). The overall interlaboratory concordance with the original interpretation of KIT immunostaining was 91.9%, the kappa value ranging from 0.72 to 0.93 (mean 0.85). The overall concordance for determining MIB-1 LI was 90% with the original evaluation, and the overall kappa value ranged from 0.62 to 0.86 (mean 0.77). These results indicate that it is possible to reliably diagnose GIST and other spindle cell tumors of the gastrointestinal tract with the use of an immunohistochemical panel of antibodies for KIT, CD34, desmin, SMA, and S-100 protein. Although there is clearly unavoidable inter-observer and interlaboratory variability in the interpretation of KIT immunostained sections and interobserver variability in the determination of MIB-1 LI, the concordance between observes is very acceptable, and in most instances such variability can be eliminated by careful reviewing of the hematoxylin and eosin and immunostained sections."
"Soft tissue sarcomas in the first year of life are rare, and the most common sarcomas in infancy are embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor, congenital infantile fibrosarcoma, and primitive sarcomas such as undifferentiated sarcoma. In this study, we report 6 cases of a primitive myxoid mesenchymal tumor of infancy (PMMTI), which previously may have been included under the diagnostic categories of congenital-infantile fibrosarcoma or infantile fibromatosis. PMMTI occurred in 6 infants, 3 of whom had a congenital presentation of a soft tissue mass. All patients were otherwise healthy. The tumors occurred on the trunk, extremities, and head and neck. Grossly, the tumors were nonencapsulated and had a multinodular appearance with focal infiltrative growth, a white fleshy cut surface, and a tumor diameter ranging from 2 to 15 cm. Histologically, a diffuse growth of primitive spindle, polygonal, and round cells occurred in a myxoid background. The tumor cells were arranged in a vaguely nodular pattern with peripheral collagenized stroma, higher cellularity at the periphery, and a delicate vascular network in the background. Immunohistochemically, the tumors displayed diffuse reactivity for vimentin and no reactivity for smooth muscle actin, muscle specific actin, desmin, S-100 protein, or myogenin. Electron microscopy documented a poorly differentiated fibroblastic proliferation. Four cases tested negative for the ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion by RT-PCR. One tumor had a complex karyotypic abnormality with rearrangements involving chromosomes Y, 9, and 3. Three patients had recurrences or metastasis treated with a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. One patient is alive with persistent locally aggressive disease, 2 are alive with no evidence of recurrence, 1 had a recurrence treated surgically without further follow-up information, 1 patient died with persistent tumor and sepsis 6 weeks after diagnosis, and 1 patient was lost to follow-up. The morphologic appearance combined with the ultrastructural features and absence of the typical gene rearrangement of congenital-infantile fibrosarcoma are unique, and we propose that PMMTI represents a new category of pediatric fibroblastic-myofibroblastic tumor."
"We report a 42 years old female that presented with abdominal pain and no palpable mass. Imaging abdominal ultrasound, CAT scan and magnetic resonance showed a solid tumor located in the retroperitoneum. The patient was operated on excising the tumor. Pathological examination of the surgical piece disclosed a retroperitoneal fibromatosis or desmoid tumor. Postoperative evolution of the patient was uneventful and she was discharged 12 days after the surgical procedure."
"We present the case of large desmoid tumor of the anterior chest wall with pleural involvement, which persistently progressed despite hormonotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery. After many years of therapeutic failures, given the tumor size and its hemodynamic repercussions, the patient was presumed to be incurable and only supportive measures were given. One year later, the desmoid tumor had completely disappeared. Even though wide surgical excision is an essential element in the treatment of desmoid tumors, spontaneous regression may occur in very advanced disease."

"D-type simian retrovirus-2 (SRV-2) causes an AIDS-like immune deficiency syndrome (SAIDS) in various macaque species. SAIDS is often accompanied by retroperitoneal fibromatosis (RF), an aggressive fibroproliferative disorder reminiscent of Kaposi's sarcoma in patients with HIV-induced AIDS. In order to determine the association of SRV-2 subtypes with SAIDS-RF, and study the evolution and transmission of SRV-2 in captive macaque populations, we have molecularly characterized the env gene of a number of SRV-2 isolates from different macaque species with and without RF. RESULTS: We sequenced the env gene from eighteen SRV-2 isolates and performed sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses. Our studies revealed the presence of six distinct subtypes of SRV-2, three of which were associated with SAIDS-RF cases. We found no association between SRV-2 subtypes and a particular macaque species. Little sequence variation was detected in SRV-2 isolates from the same individual, even after many years of infection, or from macaques housed together or related by descent from a common infected parent. Seventy-two amino acid changes were identified, most occurring in the larger gp70 surface protein subunit. In contrast to the lentiviruses, none of the amino acid variations involved potential N-linked glycosylation sites. Structural analysis of a domain within the gp22/gp20 transmembrane subunit that was 100% conserved between SRV-2 subtypes, revealed strong similarities to a disulfide-bonded loop that is crucial for virus-cell fusion and is found in retroviruses and filoviruses. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that separate introductions of at least six parental SRV-2 subtypes into the captive macaque populations in the U.S. have occurred with subsequent horizontal transfer between macaque species and primate centers. No specific association of a single SRV-2 subtype with SAIDS-RF was seen. The minimal genetic variability of the env gene within a subtype over time suggests that a strong degree of adaptation to its primate host has occurred during evolution of the virus."
"To determine the clinical efficacy of imatinib in patients with advanced aggressive fibromatosis (AF) and to identify the molecular basis of response/nonresponse to this agent. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients with AF were treated with imatinib (800 mg/d) as part of a phase II clinical study. Tumor specimens were analyzed for mutations of KIT, PDGFRA, PDGFRB, and CTNNB1 (beta-catenin). Tumor expression of total and activated KIT, PDGFRA, and PDGFRB were assessed using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting techniques. We also measured plasma levels of PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB in patients and normal patient controls. RESULTS: Three of 19 patients (15.7%) had a partial response to treatment, with four additional patients having stable disease that lasted more than 1 year (overall 1 year tumor control rate of 36.8%). No mutations of KIT, PDGFRA, or PDGFRB were found. Sixteen of 19 patients (84%) had mutations involving the WNT pathway (APC or CTNNB1). However, there was no correlation between WNT pathway mutations and clinical response to imatinib. AF tumors expressed minimal to null levels of KIT and PDGFRA but expressed levels of PDGFRB that are comparable with normal fibroblasts. However, PDGFRB phosphorylation was not detected, suggesting that PDGFRB is only weakly activated. AF patients had elevated levels of PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB compared with normal patient controls. Notably, the plasma level of PDGF-BB was inversely correlated with time to treatment failure. CONCLUSION: Imatinib is an active agent in the treatment of advanced AF. Imatinib response in AF patients may be mediated by inhibition of PDGFRB kinase activity."
"Desmoplastic fibroma is a very rare primary tumor of bone, closely related to aggressive fibromatosis of soft tissue. Although considered a benign lesion, it can be very aggressive locally and has a high rate of local recurrence after incomplete surgical excision. Radiologically, the lesion shows no distinctive features, often simulating osteosarcoma, fibrous dysplasia, or fibrosarcoma. Rib involvement by desmoplastic fibroma is extremely rare. We present two cases of desmoplastic fibroma involving this unusual location with lytic costal lesion and chest wall extension. Histological examination after surgical resection revealed that the tumor consisted of spindle cells with small, elongated nuclei in a background of numerous collagen fibers and infiltrating lamellar bone. There was no evidence of nuclear atypia, mitotic activity, or necrosis. We also discuss histological differential diagnosis as well as clinical features and the radiological and pathologic findings of this rare disease. Recognition of this entity is important to ensure proper surgical treatment."
"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are mesenchymal tumors that arise from the wall of the gastrointestinal tract expressing CD117 and/or the CD34. Similar tumors were described in the soft tissue of the abdomen and are so-called extragastrointestinal stromal tumors (EGIST). We report 4 new cases of EGIST. The tumors occurred in 2 women and 2 men, who ranged in age from 42 to 71 years. Three tumors arose from the soft tissue of the abdominal cavity, and the remainder arose from the retroperitoneum. They ranged in size from 10 to 27 cm. Three cases were composed purely of short fusiform cells tumors, the last case showed an epithelioid pattern. All the tumors expressed CD117. One patient presented with local recurrence and metastasis, one was lost to the follow-up and two patients were doing well. Immunohistochemistry is useful in distinguishing EGIST from other mesenchymal tumors. Intra-abdominal aggressive fibromatosis may express actin and CD117 but catenin is also positive, leiomyosarcoma expresses the actin and/or desmin but CD117 is usually negative, retroperitoneal dedifferentiated liposarcoma is CD117 negative and PS100 positive, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor is negative for CD117 and CD34. The solitary fibrous tumor expresses CD34 and is negative to CD117. Some tumors expressing CD117 such desmoplastic round cell tumor should not be confused with EGIST. On the occasion of these four observations, we will discuss the clinical aspects and the main differential diagnoses of this tumor."
"The purpose of our report is to illustrate an aggressive case of mesenteric fibromatosis in a 17-year-old girl with a ureteric fistula and to review imaging and pathological features, natural history and treatment options of this disease. Our patient underwent computed tomography that revealed a widespread intra-abdominal mass. The necrotic centre of this mass had a fistulous communication with the right ureter. Fibromatoses represent a spectrum of uncommon benign conditions characterised by proliferating fibrous tissue. The deep intra-abdominal form of mesenteric fibromatosis (MF), one of the rare subtypes of the 'fibromatoses' or 'desmoid tumours', grows rapidly and may become extensive. Surgery provides good results in limited disease and non-surgical modalities in cases of unresectable and residual disease."
"This paper describes the clinical, radiographic and histologic findings of an aggressive infantile (desmoid-type) fibromatosis of the face in a seven-year-old black Jamaican male. This condition is rare in the head and neck region and its occurrence in the maxilla is exceptional. The differential diagnosis, management and long term follow-up of this case are also mentioned The need for a less aggressive surgical management in this child and long-term follow-up is stressed. Also, its occurrence in someone of African descent has not been reported previously. The absence of recurrence, eight years after surgery is significant. This paper discusses the differential diagnosis and treatment of aggressive infantile fibromatosis and suggests a classification of the condition."
Mesenteric fibromatosis is a rare type of desmoid tumor characterized by local aggressiveness and a tendency to relapse. In view of these characteristics it may be considered a low-grade fibrosarcoma. Camurati-Engelmann disease is a very rare form of bone dysplasia characterized by osteosclerosis of the diaphyses of the long bones. Here we describe the case of a male patient affected by these two rare diseases in association with chronic inflammatory intestinal disease.
"In the testicular cancer post-treatment setting a rapidly growing retroperitoneal mass leads to a differential diagnosis including recurrent germ cell tumor, residual mature teratoma, or sarcomatoid degeneration. We report the case of a 27-year-old man with a large abdominal mass occurring in the setting of a mixed germ cell tumor after radical orchiectomy with primary chemotherapy followed by retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Surgical excision of this mass followed by pathological review revealed an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for isochromosome 12p failed to demonstrate a germ cell tumor origin. This is the fourth such case of an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor after retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for testicular cancer in the urologic literature. This case highlights the need for careful consideration of a desmoid tumor when a rapidly growing spindle cell tumor is encountered in a post-treatment testis cancer patient."
"Nodular fasciitis (NF) is a rapidly growing cellular mass composed of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts, usually localized in subcutaneous tissues, that typically undergoes fibrosis and almost never recurs. Desmoid tumours (DTs) are rare forms of fibroblastic/myofibroblastic growth that arise in deep soft tissues, display a propensity for local infiltration and recurrence, but fail to metastasize. Given that both entities are primarily fibroblastic/myofibroblastic lesions with overlapping histological features, their gene expression profiles were compared to identify differentially expressed genes that may provide not only potential diagnostic markers, but also clues as to the pathogenesis of each disorder. Differentially expressed transcripts (89 clones displaying increased expression in DTs and 246 clones displaying increased expression in NF) included genes encoding several receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (EPHB3, PTPRF, GNAZ, SYK, LYN, EPHA4, BIRC3), transcription factors (TWIST1, PITX2, EYA2, OAS1, MITF, TCF20), and members of the Wnt signalling pathway (AXIN2, WISP1, SFRP). Remarkably, almost one-quarter of the differentially expressed genes encode proteins associated with inflammation and tissue remodelling, including members of the interferon (IFN), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signalling pathways as well as metalloproteinases (MMP1, 9, 13, 23), urokinase plasminogen activator (PLAU), and cathepsins. The observations provide the first comparative molecular characterization of desmoid tumours and nodular fasciitis and suggest that selected tyrosine kinases, transcription factors, and members of the Wnt, TGF-beta, IFN, and TNF signalling pathways may be implicated in influencing and distinguishing their fate."

Aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumor) are rare connective tissue tumors that occur sporadically or in association with familial adenomatous polyposis. The etiology is unknown and clinical findings depend on growth into neighboring structures. Biopsy is required to establish the diagnosis. The treatment of choice is surgery. We report a case with unusual localization in this form of presentation. The patient remains asymptomatic 15 months after surgery.
"Mesenteric fibromatosis, sclerosing mesenteritis, inflammatory pseudotumor, and extrapleural solitary fibrous tumor constitute a loosely associated group of benign fibrous tumors and tumorlike lesions of the mesentery. These lesions are linked histologically by the presence of fibroblasts or fibrosis and anatomically by their location within the mesentery. Although rare, and distinctly different in pathogenesis and biologic behavior, these fibrous lesions have pathologic and radiologic features that overlap with one another and with more common neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions of the mesentery. Mesenteric fibromatosis is a locally aggressive, benign proliferative process that may occur sporadically or in association with familial adenomatous polyposis. It most frequently manifests as a focal mesenteric mass and may simulate lymphoma, metastatic disease, or a soft-tissue sarcoma. Sclerosing mesenteritis is a rare idiopathic disorder that most commonly produces a stellate mass within the mesentery and should be differentiated from metastatic disease, specifically metastatic carcinoid, because it frequently responds to conservative or medical management. Inflammatory pseudotumor (inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor) is a benign, chronic inflammatory disorder of unknown cause that manifests as a solid mesenteric mass, indistinguishable from malignancy. Extrapleural solitary fibrous tumor is a tumor of submesothelial origin that is identical to the solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura. When located in the mesentery or peritoneal cavity, extrapleural solitary fibrous tumor has an imaging pattern that must be differentiated from metastatic disease, soft-tissue sarcomas, and other benign and malignant neoplasms of the mesentery and peritoneum. Knowledge of this group of benign fibrous tumors and tumorlike lesions of the mesentery is important in the preoperative evaluation of a mesenteric mass."

"The treatment strategy for mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract is based upon typing of the tumor. Especially differential diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) to leiomyomas is crucial for determining radicality of surgery. L1 cell adhesion molecule (CD171) plays an essential role in tumor progression. The aim of this study was to determine expression of L1 in GISTs, smooth muscle tumors, desmoid-type fibromatosis and peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs). We retrospectively analyzed a total of 129 surgically resected primary tumors or metastases of 72 GISTs, 29 smooth muscle tumors, seven PNSTs and 21 desmoid-type fibromatosis by immunohistochemistry for c-kit, CD34, smooth muscle actin, desmin, vimentin, S-100 and L1 expression. L1 expression was detected in 53 (74%) of 72 GISTs but in none of 29 smooth muscle tumors or 21 desmoid-type fibromatosis (P<0.01 by Fisher's test). In all, four (57%) of seven peripheral nerve sheath tumors were L1-positive. Survival analysis of 55 surgically completely resected GISTs presenting without metastasis at initial diagnosis revealed no tumor-specific death among L1-negative patients (P=0.13 by log-rank test; median follow-up time 41 months) and one recurrence was observed (P=0.12). Interestingly high levels of L1 were seen in tumor vascular endothelial cells of smooth muscle tumors and PNSTs, but not in GISTs. Our data show that L1 is highly expressed in GISTs but not in smooth muscle tumors and desmoid-type fibromatosis being important differential diagnoses. The trend towards a reduced survival of L1-positive patients in this study has to be further evaluated in future trials with higher patient numbers."

"Desmoid tumors are locally aggressive and can be fatal in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients if they are not suitable for surgery or radiation therapy. Here, we prospectively investigated the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic regimen involving doxorubicin (DOX) and dacarbazine (DTIC) for inoperable FAP-associated desmoid tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From an initial group of 120 FAP patients, seven of the 11 individuals with symptomatic unresectable desmoid tumors that were unresponsive to conventional hormone therapy were enrolled onto this study. The general chemotherapy regimen comprised four or five cycles of DOX (20 mg/m2 daily) plus DTIC (150 mg/m2 daily) throughout 4 days of drip intravenous infusion (day 1 through 4) every 28 days, followed by the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor meloxicam (10 mg/m2). The primary end point was relapse-free survival. The secondary end points included toxicity, clinical improvement, and tumor regression according to computed tomography. RESULTS: Significant tumor regression was observed clinically and radiologically in all seven patients. Three patients showed a complete response. The average progression-free survival period was 74.0 months (range, 32.5 to 107.5 months). Three patients showed grade 3 adverse events with no treatment-related mortality. All seven patients survived and remained without tumor progression. An adenomatous polyposis coli germline-mutation analysis revealed no mutations in the specified regions. CONCLUSION: A chemotherapeutic regimen of DOX plus DTIC followed by meloxicam is an effective and safe treatment for FAP-associated desmoid tumors. This modality should be considered for use as first-line chemotherapy in symptomatic desmoid tumors that are unresponsive to conventional medical therapy, due to the absence of useful presymptomatic markers."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) is a rare, locally aggressive, proliferative fibroblastic lesion affecting musculoaponeurotic structures, most often, of the limbs and trunk. Intracranial AF is extremely rare and requires aggressive treatment to prevent recurrence. We present a case of a 34 year-old male with AF involving intracranial structures causing panhypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus. Patient was admitted to hospital because of polyuria, polydipsia, and loss of libido, impotence, hearing loss, and gait disturbance. On cranial magnetic resonance imaging, the lesion extended through the sphenoid sinus into the both pterygoid recesses, destroying the left lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus and invading the retroorbital area. There was also a distinct lesion in the hypothalamic area. The tumor was markedly isointense on both T2- and T1-weighted images relative to gray matter, and enhanced strongly after administration of gadolinium. The patient underwent partial resection of the lesion via a transcranial approach. The pathological examination of the mass was reported as AF. No other sites were found to be involved by thorax and abdominal tomography. Hormonal assessment of hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction revealed panhypopituitarism with central diabetes insipidus. Replacement therapy was instituted. In this case, standard treatment of wide-field surgical resection was impossible. On the basis of reports that radiotherapy is an effective treatment for this kind of tumor, we administered radiation to the affected area, since chemotherapy and hormonal treatment of non-resectable tumors are not satisfactory. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of AF presenting as panhypopituitarism with central diabetes insipidus."
"Desmoplastic fibroma is a benign intraosseous neoplasm that is recognized as the intraosseous counterpart of soft tissue fibromatosis in both gnathic and extragnathic sites. It has a propensity for locally aggressive behavior and local recurrence. In the present report, we define the clinicopathological and radiographic features of a desmoplastic fibroma of the mandible in an 8-year-old white boy who initially presented with a 2-month history of a rapidly expanding, painless mass along the right inferior border of his mandible. A critical and comprehensive review of the English language literature is also provided."
"We present the MRI features with pathologic correlation of aggressive fibromatosis, incorporating 203 cases over a 5-year period from the Royal Marsden Hospital Sarcoma Unit database. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty patients had imaging available for retrospective review of which 29 had preoperative MRI and final histopathologic diagnosis of aggressive fibromatosis. RESULTS: The average age at diagnosis was 41.3 years with a female-to-male sex ratio of 1.2:1. Twenty lesions were extraabdominal; six, intraabdominal; and three, in the abdominal wall (classic desmoid). The average tumor size was 6.4 cm (range, 2.2-13.7 cm). Intraabdominal aggressive fibromatosis produced the largest tumors, averaging 9.5 cm. Most lesions were ovoid (52%) or infiltrative (34.5%) in outline with an irregular or lobulated contour (76%). The lesions crossed major fascial boundaries in 31% of cases overall and in 66% of patients referred for recurrent disease. On MRI, homogeneous isointensity or mild hyperintensity on T1-weighted images and heterogenous high signal on T2-weighted or STIR images were seen. All lesions enhanced after IV gadolinium, usually avidly. In contrast to previous reports, 38% of cases failed to show low signal on all pulse sequences and no abnormalities were seen in local bone structures. Histology showed sheets of bland spindle cells in dense collagen and did not vary with the MRI signal characteristics of the lesion. Patients referred for recurrent disease were most likely to have a recurrence after surgery. MRI and pathology findings did not predict recurrence. CONCLUSION: Accurate diagnosis and staging of aggressive fibromatosis by MRI have important treatment and prognostic implications."
Desmoid tumors of the female pelvis are rare. The efficacy of the available treatment modalities in improving survival and decreasing recurrence remains controversial. A 32-year-old woman presented with an asymptomatic large ischeorectal mass. Computed tomography scan revealed a large tumor adherent to the pubic bone and impinging on the bladder neck and the rectum. Aggressive surgical removal of the mass including partial osteotomy of the pubic bone was followed by radiotherapy. The patient is still alive 6 years later with no evidence of disease. Aggressive surgical management followed by radiotherapy is an acceptable means of treatment of locally invasive desmoid tumor of the female pelvis.
"Early experiments using ligand-binding assays demonstrated the presence of estrogen receptor (ER) in fibromatoses. These findings were not confirmed by later studies using immunohistochemical analysis. METHODS: To verify the expression of ERs in fibromatosis as well as to clarify the inconsistency between radioligand and early immunohistochemical studies, the authors examined a series of 40 extraabdominal fibromatoses using antibodies raised against ERbeta. RESULTS: All 40 cases of extraabdominal fibromatosis were at least focally positive for ERbeta. Thirty-three of 40 (83%) displayed 3+ (>50%) expression, 5 of 40 (12%) were 2+ (11-50%), and 2 of 40 (5%) cases showed 1+ (<10%) expression. All cases were negative for ERalpha. CONCLUSIONS: Although extraabdominal fibromatosis does not express ERalpha, there appears to be nearly uniform expression of ERbeta. This finding clarifies discrepancies in the literature regarding estrogen expression in fibromatosis, and provides a biological mechanism for the action of antiestrogenic compounds in the treatment of fibromatosis. Estrogen antagonists may have a role in the treatment of refractory or recurrent extraabdominal fibromatoses."

"The major symptoms of Gardner-syndrome are described by the authors (multiple osteomas, desmoid tumors, colon polyps with malignant tendency) with a case appearing in their department. The importance of early diagnosis is also emphasized."
"Desmoid tumors, also known as aggressive fibromatosis, are rare fibroblastic tumors that exhibit a wide range of local aggressiveness, from largely indolent to locally destructive. Understanding of the pathogenesis and the great heterogeneity in the natural history of desmoid tumors is invaluable to the development of therapeutic strategies. The optimal treatment protocol has not yet been established and, in many cases, a multidisciplinary approach including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy has been employed. The rarity of cases in even major tumor centers has traditionally limited the ability to study this disease. Several novel pharmacologic and biologic treatment approaches are actively being developed, although long-term follow-up is needed for their substantiation."
"Authors reviewed single center experience of intestinal transplantation for treatment of intra-abdominal neoplastic disease. METHODS: There were 25 auto- or allograft transplantations in 21 patients; desmoid tumor (14), neuroendocrine tumor (2), adenocarcinoma (2), hemangioma (1), lymphoma (1), and solid pseudopapillary tumor (1). Medical records were reviewed for cause of graft loss and mortality, recurrent neoplasm, and quality of life. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: There were 11 graft losses; mortality with functioning graft (6), ischemic necrosis (2), acute or chronic rejection (2), and arterial thrombosis (1) during 38 months of mean follow-up. Seven patients died because of recurrent neoplasm and transplant related complications. Six patients experienced recurrent disease; three desmoid tumor (3/14), two adenocarcinoma (2/2), and one neuroendocrine tumor (1/2). Recurrent desmoid tumors were successfully treated with simple excision. Patient and graft survival in the desmoid tumor are 69.2% and 50.0% at 5 years after transplant. Among 14 survivors, 2 need parenteral nutrition or intravenous hydration. Twelve patients are working full time. CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal transplantation is a reasonable life-saving treatment for catastrophic intra-abdominal neoplastic diseases."
"A 36-year-old woman visited our department because of back pain. Chest CT showed the 35 x 20 mm mass to be located in the left posterior mediastinum. Neurogenic tumor or pulmonary sequestration was suspected. We followed the tumor for 2 years, chest CT revealed an increase in size. En bloc resection of the tumor was performed. The tumor originated in the posterior mediastinum, protruded into the thoracic cavity and adhered to the left lower lobe and invaded the diaphragm, measuring 65 x 50 x 25 mm in size. This tumor was diagnosed pathologically as desmoid tumor which showed proliferation of spindle shape cells with collagen fibers, but with no cytologic atypia or mitotic figures were present. The tumor was alpha smooth muscle actin-positive, vimentin-positive, CD34-negative. Desmoid tumor of the posterior mediastinum is very rare. Desmoid tumors grow infiltratively and the recurrence rate after operation is high. Therefore, long-term follow up will be necessary in this case, although the patient has been well for 10 months."
"Fibroepithelial lesions of the breast are commonly seen in clinical practice. The masses are composed of a combination of prominent stroma and varying glandular elements. Fibroadenomas, benign lesions that derive from the terminal duct lobular unit, are the most common and are often identified at clinical examination or mammography as circumscribed masses. Benign mesenchymal tumors include focal fibrosis, pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia, and fibromatosis or desmoid tumor. Phyllodes tumor, which is similar to fibroadenoma but has increased cellularity in the stroma, is typically benign but has malignant potential. Diabetic fibrous mastopathy, a stromal proliferation found in patients with juvenile-onset insulin-dependent diabetes, is a reactive fibrous lesion. Most of these lesions manifest as masses at clinical and/or mammographic examination. Some (eg, fibroadenomas) may be associated with calcifications. Except for fibromatosis and phyllodes tumor, fibroepithelial lesions need not be excised if the diagnosis is confirmed by the results of histologic analysis at percutaneous biopsy. To correctly differentiate between fibrous breast lesions that are benign and those that should be resected, the physician must be familiar with the correlated radiologic-pathologic findings in the various lesion types."
"Data on radio- and thermoradiotherapy of 83 patients with extra-abdominal desmoid tumors are discussed. In a group of 57 patients followed up for 10 years or less, the relapse-free survival rates, in thermoradiotherapy-treated cases, were significantly higher (74.4% and 28.6%) than in those receiving radiotherapy (9.3% and 57.1%). Monitoring tumor temperature during local hyperthermia is a factor of relapse-free survival of vital importance."
"Although the standard treatment for desmoid tumours is complete surgical resection with wide margins, the optimal adjuvant treatment for recurrent or inoperable disease is unclear, often being based on sporadic immunohistochemical reports with a low number of cases. Therefore, a large immunohistochemical study was performed, to provide a theoretical basis for adjuvant treatment regimens. METHODS: One hundred and sixteen tissue samples from 80 patients (49 female, 31 male; mean age, 34 years; range, 0-83) with desmoid tumours (46 extra-abdominal, 21 abdominal, 13 intra-abdominal) were tested for oestrogen receptors alpha and beta, progesterone and androgen receptors, and somatostatin, in addition to HER2, cathepsin D, Ki-67, and c-KIT by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: All samples were negative for oestrogen receptor alpha, HER2, and the progesterone receptor. Positive staining for the androgen receptor was found in six extra-abdominal cases. Staining for oestrogen receptor beta was positive in four extra-abdominal, two abdominal, and one intra-abdominal case. Staining for somatostatin was positive in six extra-abdominal, two abdominal, and one intra-abdominal case, and staining for cathepsin D was positive in all cases. Positive staining for Ki-67 was found in 14 extra-abdominal, three abdominal, and three intra-abdominal cases. C-KIT was detectable in one abdominal case only. CONCLUSIONS: The data from this immunohistochemical study show that the published effects of antioestrogens and imatinib mesylate in the treatment of aggressive fibromatoses may not be attributable to oestrogen receptor alpha or c-KIT expression."
"Benign neoplasms and tumor-like lesions constitute the majority of soft tissue masses in the foot and ankle. Therefore, malignant tumors are often unsuspected at this site and misdiagnosed clinically, especially if occurring in young individuals with unspecific or long-standing clinical symptoms. In addition to radiography, MR imaging represents the method of choice in evaluation of foot tumors. Because of their relatively characteristic imaging appearance, in most cases of benign soft tissue lesions of the foot and ankle a specific diagnosis can be suggested. Unfortunately, malignant tumors can also arise with nonaggressive imaging features. Diagnostic errors can be avoided if any soft tissue lesion that cannot be specifically diagnosed is regarded as potentially malignant until proved otherwise. This article reviews the MR appearance of the most common benign and malignant soft tissue masses in the foot and ankle together with their clinical, radiographic, and pathological findings."
The desmoid tumor is a solid tumor with soft parts and with various possible locations. It is not very frequent and of unknown presentation in our medium. We presented the case of a patient who was treated of extrinsic duodenal obstruction. A compression of the third section of the duodenum was found. The diagnosis was made by pathological anatomy.
"1) an invasive carcinomatous component identifiable on hematoxylin and eosin stains comprising less than 5% of the invasive tumor; or 2) associated ductal carcinoma in situ; or 3) immunohistochemical expression of keratin in the sarcomatoid areas. Patients with low-grade fibromatosis-like metaplastic tumors and those who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. Axillary lymph node dissection or limited axillary node excision was performed in 17 patients, including 1 patient who had a sentinel lymph node biopsy. Lymph node involvement occurred in only 1 patient and consisted of a single 3.5-mm metastasis. Clinical follow-up was available for 21 patients and ranged from 4 months to 155 months (median follow-up, 35 months). Ten patients experienced local relapse, including 7 of 11 patients treated with breast-conserving surgery, and 9 developed distant metastases, most frequently to the lungs. These findings suggest that metaplastic sarcomatoid carcinomas that lack or have only a minimal overt invasive carcinomatous component have a biologic behavior similar to that of sarcomas. In addition to systemic treatment, early aggressive local therapy is recommended, as these patients have a high rate of local relapse."
"Desmoid tumors are very rare mesenchymal tumors with a partially aggressive growth pattern and high relapse rates. Without metastases, they are classified as semi-malignant tumours. The treatment of this neoplasia is discussed controversially. Up to now, there exists no broad consensus on the treatment regimes. Traditionally, the primary radical surgical resection is often preferred. This might be combined with an (neo-)adjuvant radiation therapy. Recently an increasing importance of radiotherapy has been described. Several studies favour radiotherapy as the single form of treatment. Furthermore several medication regimes have been described in the literature. CASE REPORTS: We report the follow-up of 4 patients who were treated for desmoid tumours. In 2 cases surgery was the primary treatment. After R0-resection and adjuvant radiation therapy, one of the patients developed 7 relapses. In another patient, 5 relapses were observed after surgical therapy. DISCUSSION: Therapeutic guidelines with broad acceptance do not exist up to now due to missing data of prospective studies with sufficient case numbers. In our opinion wide surgical resection should be performed in primary occurring cases with resectable tumours. On account of the previous experiences, it can be concluded that therapy of primary non respectable or recurrent desmoid tumours is not only a domain of a surgical approach. At present an adequate treatment should be planned interdisciplinary by surgeons, radiation therapists and oncologists. For generally accepted guidelines for this rare disease, general therapeutic options based on prospectively randomised studies have to be elaborated."

"Fibromatosis is a rare locally aggressive fibroproliferative neoplasm. Vulvar fibromatosis is extremely rare tumor. A case of a young woman is reported who presented with large vulvar, thigh and breast masses and was surgically treated. The pathological examination showed fibromatosis of vulvar and thigh masses and fibroadenoma of breast lump."
"Exact categorization of soft tissue tumours (STTs) on smears requires application of various ancillary techniques. This study was aimed at evaluating the role of fluorescent immunocytochemistry (FICC) in cyto-diagnosis of 30 STT cases. METHODS: Thirty cases of soft tissue tumours were included in the present study. All cases were subjected to routine Giemsa and Papanicolaou stain. Extra smears were made and kept for fluorescent immunostaining. A panel of cytoskeletal antibodies, tagged with FITC (Fluorescein isothyocynate), was employed in all these cases. Fluorescent immunostained smears were examined under Zeiss Confocal Laser scanning microscope, using double immunofluorescence (red-green). Finally, all cases were subjected to biopsy and again immunoperoxidase staining. RESULTS: Among the 30 cases in the present study, unaided cytological diagnoses ranged from 'spindle cell' tumour in four (13.3%) cases, benign and malignant spindle cell tumour in 17 (56.6%) cases, to malignant mesenchymal tumour in nine (30%) cases. FICC helped in further correct categorization of 25/30 (83.3%) cases viz. leiomyoma (three), benign neurogenic tumour (six), schwannoma (one), dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (three), synovial sarcoma (two), rhabdomyosarcoma (two), malignant fibrous histiocytoma (five) and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour (three). Aggressive fibromatosis was found to be a missed diagnosis in two cases. Overall concordance between cyto-diagnosis with FICC, and histopathology results was 83.3% (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Fluorescent immunocytochemistry is a significant ancillary technique for making a rapid and specific diagnosis of STT, as required for their timely management. Incorporation of a wide panel of antibody markers with clinico-cytological correlation is recommended in forming an exact diagnosis in these cases."
"Intra-abdominal fibromatosis (IAF) is a rare benign neoplasm arising from the abdominal fibrous tissue, mostly in the mesentery. IAF is characterized by a tendency to infiltrate the surrounding vessels and vital structures and recurrence after usually incomplete surgical removal. Accordingly, IAF is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The authors report on a boy who presented with a large IAF at the age of 5 years. Within 6 months after initial presentation, he underwent 4 subsequent abdominal explorations for diagnosis, tumor reduction, and intestinal obstructions. IAF was confirmed by the presence of vimentin and absence of other biological cell markers. Due to accelerated tumor growth and deteriorated general condition, as a last resort, a chemotherapy trial with vincristin and methotrexate was carried out. This regimen proved to be effective in reducing the tumor burden and improving the patient's general condition. Outcome of IAF depends on early diagnosis and complete tumor resection, and, if indicated, timely employment of neo/adjuvant chemotherapy. Radiotherapy must be considered in life-threatening conditions as the last resort in a growing child [2-4]."
"Desmoplastic fibroma of bone is a very rare primary bone tumor morphologically resembling desmoid-type fibromatosis, its much more common counterpart of soft tissue. The aim of this study is to investigate the immunohistochemical profile and the involvement of the beta-catenin pathway in desmoplastic fibroma as it is known in desmoid-type fibromatosis. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 13 cases of desmoplastic fibroma for muscle-specific markers, estrogen and progesterone receptors, CD117, beta-catenin, and the potential downstream target of beta-catenin, namely, cyclin D1. In all 13 cases, DNA sequencing was performed for the detection of activating beta-catenin gene mutations. There was no immunoreactivity of CD117, estrogen, and progesterone receptors. Seven cases were immunoreactive for one or more muscle-specific markers. In 6 cases, there was overexpression of beta-catenin in the cytoplasm; in one of these cases, there was also accumulation of beta-catenin in the nucleus. In 6 cases in which DNA sequencing was successful, no beta-catenin mutations were detected. Search in a national database showed that not a single case over a frame of 23 years was associated with occurrence of colon cancer in the same patient. The epidemiological, histological, and immunohistochemical findings in desmoplastic fibroma are suggestive of desmoplastic fibroma being the bony counterpart of the more common desmoid-type fibromatosis of soft tissue. However, the beta-catenin pathway does not seem to have the same essential role in the tumorigenesis of desmoplastic fibroma, as it has in desmoid-type fibromatosis."
"Gardner's syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by the presence of colonic polyposis, osteomas and a multitude of soft tissue tumors. The syndrome may present at any age from 2 mo to 70 years with a variety of symptoms, either colonic or extracolonic. We present a case of a 11-year-old female patient with Gardner's syndrome who presented with a lumbar area desmoid tumor and treated with resection of the desmoid, restorative proctocolectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis, A review of the current literature has been performed."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) involving bones of the head is rare and surgery is often complicated by a high recurrence rate. Interdisciplinary treatment is of the utmost importance to avoid extensive, mutilating resection. Two cases emphasize the difficulties in the management. CASE REPORTS: A 67-year-old woman was referred to our unit with a blepharochalasis of the left upper palpebra and a palsy of the face on the left side. Her medical history included 12 operations over the previous 4 years for an extensive AF. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our review includes all case reports of AF involving bones of the head published between 1960 and 2004. Additionally, our two cases are presented. Signs, symptoms and outcome were analyzed in relation to different treatment options. CONCLUSION: According to the literature, surgery is the most common treatment for AF in the head and neck region. Alternative modes of therapy must be considered because of the high recurrence rate and to avoid mutilating operations."

"We report a case of intrathoracic desmoid tumor without familial adenomatous polyposis and demonstrate beta-catenin mutation of exon 3. A 15-year-old male presented with a desmoid tumor after having sustained an assault. In an examination for a mutation of the beta-catenin gene, an activating mutation from ACC (Thr) to GCC (Ala) at codon 41 was found. Immunohistochemical staining showed that accumulated beta-catenin protein was predominantly localized in the nuclei of desmoid cells, and cyclin D1 protein was also overexpressed. These findings might suggest that an activating mutation of the beta-catenin gene affected regulation of the cyclin D1 gene, resulting in the generation of intrathoracic sporadic desmoid tumor, which arose at the site of posttraumatic injury."
We report a long-term follow-up of a female patient with a multifocal extremity desmoid tumour. She had 3 local recurrences after excision and developed a second unresectable pelvic tumour that has remained unchanged in size for 14 years since starting tamoxifen treatment.
"Mesenteric fibromatosis is a proliferative fibroblastic neoplasia of the small intestine mesentery which may occur as a unique or multiple formation. Mesenteric fibromatosis represents the 8% of all desmoid neoplasm. Giant mesenteric fibromatosis is uncommon by itself (2-4 case/milion/year). Since the rarity of this tumor and the difficulties in diagnostic and therapeutic ambit, we believe it justified to describe a case of giant mesenteric fibromatosis which came to our observation."
"Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF) is an autosomal recessive disease that presents with multiple subcutaneous nodular tumours, gingival fibromatosis, flexion contractures of the joint and hyaline material accumulation in extracellular area. Recently, the causative gene for JHF, capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2) was identified. In this case report, periodontal status, treatment and follow-up together with histopathologic evaluation of gingival tissue specimens and mutation screening of two JHF cases are presented. CASE REPORTS: A 10-year-old female (case 1) and her 3-year-old brother (case 2) were first examined in our department with a complaint of gingival hyperplasia in 1991. Symptoms of the disease were detected in two of four siblings in the family. Several gingivectomy operations were carried out over 11 years with hygiene motivation and initial phase therapy. After the last gingivectomy operation in 2002, the patients were reviewed frequently. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Although there was linear marginal gingival inflammation, no remarkable enlargement was noted at last appointment. Histopathological findings showed increased amounts of subepithelial nodular connective tissue, thinned epithelial mucosa, separated inter-cellular bridges and decreased numbers of connective tissue cells in gingival tissue samples. Electron microscopic examinations supported the histopathological findings. Mutation screening of CMG2 demonstrated that the siblings were homozygous for a pathogenic missense mutation, V386F. Our clinical findings demonstrate that gingivectomy is useful and frequent periodontal visits are important for maintaining oral hygiene and decreasing growth rate of gingiva in JHF."
"Desmoid tumours are soft tissue sarcomas with local aggressive behaviour and a high rate of local recurrence after treatment. Although they do not tend to metastasise systemically, the local aggressiveness can lead to situations in which limb-preserving surgery cannot be performed without severe disability. As isolated limb perfusion (ILP) with TNF and melphalan has proven to be extremely effective in the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, we studied its potential in locally advanced extremity desmoid tumours. METHODS: Prospectively maintained database in a tertiary referral centre. Between 1991 and 2003, 12 ILP procedures were performed in 11 patients for locally advanced desmoid tumours. Local surgical therapy with preservation of limb function was impossible in all patients due to large or multifocal tumours, multiple recurrences or extensive previous treatment. Perfusions were performed with 4-3mg TNF and 10-13 mg/l limb volume melphalan form leg and arm perfusions, respectively. RESULTS: Overall response rate was 75%: Two complete responses were recorded (17%) and seven patients had a partial response (58%). Amputation could be avoided in all cases. Local control was obtained after 10/12 ILPs and in the other two patients through repeat ILP and systemic chemotherapy, thus leading to an overall local control rate of 100%. Local toxicity was mild and systemic toxicity was absent in all patients. CONCLUSION: ILP is a very effective treatment option in the multimodality treatment of limb desmoid tumours. It should be considered in patients with aggressive and disabling disease where resection without important functional sacrifice is impossible."
"The detection of a solid abdominal mass after surgery for testicular cancer most frequently represents metastatic disease. We report an unusual case of mesenteric desmoid tumor presenting after retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for metastatic testicular cancer. To our knowledge, there are no similar reports in the radiology literature."

Experience of reconstructive surgeries after extensive resections of anterior abdominal and chest walls performed on account of tumors is described. Recovery of integrity of anterior abdominal wall was performed by serial grafting with dura mater and polypropylene net implant. The thorax was repaired with special grafts of the ribs and sternum. The integrity of the skin was reestablished with either suturing of the separated flaps or transposition of myodermal flap on vascular pedicle.
"To report a case of a pelvic desmoid tumor that was treated with the antiestrogen toremifene after a failed attempt at surgical excision. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: University reproductive endocrine practice. PATIENT(S): A reproductive-aged woman with a recurrent desmoid tumor. INTERVENTION(S): After surgical excision of a desmoid tumor that presented during childbirth, subsequent recurrence resulted in the use of toremifene for tumor stabilization. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Magnetic resonance imaging was used to monitor desmoid tumor size. RESULT(S): One year after postsurgical recurrence of the desmoid tumor, the patient began treatment with the antiestrogen toremifene. Tumor stabilization and regression with symptomatic relief was observed. Nine years of antiestrogen use revealed no progression in tumor size or patient symptoms. After the patient demonstrated perimenopausal symptoms, toremifene administration was discontinued without a return of symptoms or tumor growth after 3 years. CONCLUSION(S): Our case demonstrates that toremifene is a safe and effective therapy that can be used for the stabilization and regression of desmoid tumors. An antiestrogen should be considered as adjuvant therapy after surgery and as a first-line treatment with disease recurrence. Discontinuation of antiestrogen therapy was shown to be done safely after the patient started to show signs of decreased endogenous estrogen production."

"The risk of second malignancies after successful treatment for Hodgkin disease can be considerable. The most common malignancies are solid tumors arising in irradiated sites, such as the breast and thyroid gland after mantle field radiation. Sarcomas and other musculoskeletal tumors are also seen. We describe a young woman who developed an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor more than 4 years after completing therapy for Stage IIB Hodgkin disease, treated with combination chemotherapy (ABVD) and mantle irradiation. The tumor did not occur at either a surgical site or within a radiation field. She did not carry a mutation for familial adenomatosis polypoli."
"A woman with a history of desmoid tumor involving the T9-T10 vertebrae was treated with local irradiation. After treatment, she developed tingling sensations in both legs. An FDG PET study demonstrated focally increased activity posterior to the vertebral bodies at the levels of T9-T10, which was vertical in orientation, corresponding to the location of the spinal cord at this level. This finding is consistent with the clinical suspicion of radiation myelopathy."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) is a soft tissue tumor and is rare in childhood, with high potential for local invasiveness and recurrence. General recommendations for the clinical management of pediatric patients with AF remain undetermined. METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed 13 children with AF who were diagnosed from 1987 until 2004 in the Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, and a review of the pediatric literature was conducted. RESULTS: Two patients received preoperative chemotherapy with combined vincristine, actinomycin-D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC). All 13 patients underwent surgery. Three of six patients who underwent incomplete resection received adjuvant treatment, two patients received radiotherapy, and one patient received chemotherapy (VAC). The median follow-up was 3.9 years (range, 0.6-14.0 years). Three patients developed recurrent AF, including two recurrences after patients underwent incomplete resection without adjuvant treatment. Secondary resection was performed, which was incomplete in one patient who subsequently received chemotherapy (VAC). At the time of the current report, all 13 patients were in complete remission. Ten pediatric AF studies, including the current study, with a total of 187 patients were reviewed. Incomplete resection was the most important determinant for disease recurrence; in the authors' opinion, the role of adjuvant therapy needs to be studied further. CONCLUSIONS: Primary surgery with negative surgical margins was found to be the most successful primary treatment modality for children with AF. Positive margins after surgery indicated a high risk for disease recurrence. Multicenter, prospective (randomized) trials will be necessary to clarify the role of adjuvant treatment for patients with pediatric AF."
"A rare case of desmoid-type fibromatosis with focal metaplastic bone in the chest wall suggested that enhanced responsiveness to BMP signaling by decreasing BAMBI expression through promoter hypermethylation plays a crucial role in the formation of metaplastic bone. INTRODUCTION: Desmoid-type fibromatosis, originating from mesenchymal cells with myofibroblastic features, is a locally aggressive and frequently recurring infiltrative lesion. One such sporadic case with metaplastic ossification in the chest wall is presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 43-year-old man was referred to the hospital with a gradually enlarging hard mass in the left anterolateral chest wall. A thoracotomy was carried out, and histopathological specimens were used for immunohistochemical, genetic, and methylation studies. RESULTS: Accumulation of altered beta-catenin associated with a somatic heterozygous activating mutation in codon 41 was detected in the typical desmoid-type fibromatosis and at the ossifying focus. Among factors related to bone formation and the classical wnt-beta-catenin signaling pathway, BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (BAMBI) expression was specifically downregulated at the ossifying focus. Hypermethylation of the BAMBI promoter was observed in microdissected tissue from the ossifying focus but not in that from the typical desmoid-type fibromatosis. CONCLUSIONS: Because both BMP and classical Wnt/beta-catenin/LEF1 signaling cooperatively and mutually induce differentiation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblastic cells and promote bone formation, the epigenetic event leading to the enhanced responsiveness to BMP signaling may play a crucial role in the formation of metaplastic bone."
"Retroperitoneal sarcomas are rare malignant tumors with an aggressive course of disease and high local recurrence rate. Local disease is the main cause of death. A retrospective study was undertaken to evaluate the results of aggressive surgical treatment in a series of patients of primary and recurrent retroperitoneal sarcomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1975 to 2000, 155 patients with retroperitoneal tumors were operated on at the Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana. Patients with fibromatosis and children less than 16 years were excluded from further calculation. Out of the rest 139 patients, 102 patients had localized retroperitoneal sarcoma, and 37 patients had retroperitoneal sarcoma with distant metastases Leiomyosarcoma was the most common type of histology, followed by liposarcoma and schwannoma. Their referral status was as follow: 56 had primary sarcoma, 20 residual sarcoma after operation elsewhere and 26 already recurrent sarcoma. Our treatment approach was aggressive. We removed surgically primary tumor, recurrent sarcoma and metastases, whenever possible. To this end, we performed, 235 operations for retroperitoneal sarcomas on 139 patients (up to 8 operations on 1 patient). RESULTS: Complete resection was done in 97 of 102 patients with localized sarcoma (resectability rate 95%); in 55 patients, R0 resection was made, in 42 patients, R1 resection, in 3 patients, debulking procedure, and in 2 patients biopsy alone. In 118, patients at least one organ was resected completely or partially en bloc with tumor. The 5-, 10-, and 15-year survivals of patients with localized sarcoma were 52%, 36%, and 22%, respectively. The 5-year survival of patients with metastases was 12% (P = 0.0002), the 5- and 10-year survival rates of patients with R0 resection were 75% and 64%, respectively, and of those with R1 resection, 25% and 8%, respectively (0 < 0.00001). High tumor grade was associated with poor survival. The 5-year local recurrence rate of patients with primary sarcoma and of those with locally recurrent sarcoma was 37% and 71%, respectively (P = 0.04). After the first local recurrence, the 5- and 10-year survival rates were 42% and 26%, after the second local recurrence 45% and 22%, after the third local recurrence 43% and 11%, and after the fourth local recurrence 51% and 17%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Complete surgical resection without microscopic residuum and contamination is likely to offer the best chances for long-term survival. Until there are no other treatment modalities, aggressive surgery for recurrent sarcoma is recommended."
"Desmoid tumours, also known as aggressive fibromatoses, are rare lesions having intermediate biological behaviour between benign fibrous lesions and fibrosarcomas. Although abdominal desmoids have an increased incidence in Gardner's syndrome, they are rarely found in isolated form. We report a barium study, ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings of a case in a nine-year-old boy with intermittent nausea and vomiting. Although intraabdominal desmoids are usually detected as a solitary lesion in sporadic cases, the case presented here had two mesenteric lesions in the left upper quadrant. Intestinal obstruction and invasion of colon wall had occurred."

"Aggressive musculoskeletal tumors in the foot, such as diffuse-type giant cell tumors or extra-abdominal desmoid tumors, are difficult to treat because the foot does not have enough soft tissue to allow wide tumor resection. We reviewed the clinical behavior of diffuse-type giant cell tumor in the foot and evaluated the recurrence potential of these tumors from radiologic and pathologic perspectives. METHODS: Six patients with a mean age of 37.6 years were included in this study. Radiologic studies, including sonography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and bone and gallium citrate scintigraphy, were obtained followed by surgical treatment and histologic evaluation of the tumor. RESULTS: Recurrence occurred in three patients. Although CT and MRI findings were similar in the recurrent and nonrecurrent tumors, marked differences were found between the two by scintigraphy; positive radiotracer uptake to the affected foot with gallium citrate scintigraphy was noted only in recurrent tumors, although positive accumulation was seen in all patients with bone scintigraphy. Histologically, the necrotic area and mitotic activity were more apparent in recurrent than in the nonrecurrent tumors, and tumor cell dyscohesion was noted in the former, (the intercellular space was increased). CONCLUSIONS: Repeated recurrence with tumor invasion into tarsal bone resulted in breakage of the tarsal arch that supports the body's weight. Amputation would be necessary for patients in whom the disease had progressed to obtain local cure and relief of pain. In the present study, we found two features of the recurrence potential of diffuse-type giant cell tumors: sparse cell to cell contact on pathologic examination and positive accumulation in the tumor on gallium citrate scintigraphy. We concluded that giant cell tumors with these two features have a strong potential for local recurrence, and thus require intensive followup."

"A 17-year-old male with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) presented with chest pain and significant weight loss. An abdominal CT scan detected a cystic pancreatic lesion of unknown etiology. The patient therefore underwent surgical resection of the distal pancreas, which included the lesion, because of the known association of pancreatic cancer with FAP. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen showed a benign pancreatic cyst and fibrous plaque with desmoid fibromatosis adherent to the surface of the pancreas, serosa of the stomach, and colon. The fibrous plaque was histologically identical to the fibrous mesenteric plaque known to occur in FAP and associated mesenteric fibromatosis. We present pathologic evidence that the pancreatic cyst formation was induced by FAP-associated desmoid invasion. Desmoid growth should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a pancreatic cystic mass lesion in patients with FAP or its Gardner syndrome variant. This case report provides the first pathologic evidence for benign epithelial cyst formation in the pancreas caused by fibromatosis invasion of that organ as a part of FAP."
"Desmoid tumors (also called deep fibromatoses) are rare benign tumors associated with pregnancy and Gardner syndrome. These tumors are characterized by bland-appearing fibroblasts, indistinct margins, and an ability to cause pathology by local invasion and recurrence. They arise in the abdominal cavity, in the abdominal wall, or in the extremities/trunk, each with a slightly different biologic behavior. Though they are not cancer and do not metastasize, desmoids can cause significant morbidity and occasionally death through local/regional invasion of critical structures. Treatment primarily is surgical, although radiation or systemic therapy can be beneficial to the patient when surgery is not feasible. This article highlights the biology and clinical features of desmoid tumors."
"Mesenteric fibromatosis (MF) is a rare, benign tumor commonly associated with Gardner's syndrome. The signs and symptoms in patients with MF are insidious. Patients may present with abdominal pain or discomfort when the tumors reach large sizes, which is typical at the time of diagnosis. Differentiating MF from other neoplasms such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors may present a diagnostic dilemma, especially in patients without any history of familial adenomatous polyposis. In the present report, we discuss a young girl who presented with MF. A pertinent review of the literature is also presented. This case is peculiar in that MF presented at a young age in a patient without history of familial adenomatous polyposis and occurred in the omentum with local invasion to the stomach."
"Immunohistochemical staining for beta-catenin may be used as an indicator of the integrity of the Wnt signaling and beta-catenin degradation pathways. Among mesenchymal tumors, aberrant nuclear localization of beta-catenin is seen in desmoid-type fibromatoses but has not been described for solitary fibrous tumors that may mimic the former lesions, especially in small biopsy samples. OBJECTIVE: To study the immunohistochemical expression of beta-catenin in solitary fibrous tumors. DESIGN: We performed immunohistochemical staining for beta-catenin in 12 solitary fibrous tumors, one of which showed histologic features of malignancy. RESULTS: All the tumors showed strong and diffuse reactivity for beta-catenin. Four tumors (33%) showed nuclear staining for beta-catenin, whereas the remaining tumors showed either a membranous or mixed membranous and cytoplasmic pattern of staining. The only histologically malignant tumor of the group showed a mixed membranous and cytoplasmic pattern of staining for beta-catenin. CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical staining for beta-catenin in solitary fibrous tumors does not show a consistent pattern, which may be due to differences in tumorigenesis. Larger studies with clinical follow-up are required for estimating the impact of the variable staining pattern on clinical behavior of these tumors."
"Desmoid tumors are a clinical problem in 12 to 15 percent of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. There is no predictably effective treatment for intra-abdominal desmoid tumors, which sometimes cause significant complications by their effects on the ureters or bowel. The relative rarity and the clinical heterogeneity of intra-abdominal desmoid tumors make randomized studies difficult to do. In this article a staging system is proposed to make multi-institutional studies easier. METHODS: Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors can be staged according to their size, clinical presentation and growth pattern. CONCLUSION: A way of staging intra-abdominal desmoid tumors is proposed to facilitate stratification by disease severity during collaborative studies of various treatments."
"Desmoid tumours are rare neoplasms that display local aggressiveness but no propensity to metastasise. They are mainly localized in the abdominal wall, the bowel, and the mesentery or in extra-abdominal sites such as the trunk and the extremities. Surgical resection is the main treatment modality in extremities and trunk, with the optional combination of radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. However, these tumours have a high propensity for recurrent growth."
"Breast fibromatosis is a rare, benign, recurring, locally destructive entity. CASE: A 35-year-old woman underwent right-sided lumpectomy, revealing fibromatosis with epithelial hyperplasia. Two years later, she was re-evaluated due to a three times as large mass recurrence on X-ray mammography. (99m)Tc-(V)DMSA scintimammography revealed diffuse increased radiotracer uptake occupying the entire breast. A less widespread similar uptake was observed in the contralateral breast. Mammography did identify neither the posterior margins of the mass nor the left-sided lesion. The patient underwent mastectomy and left-sided open biopsy, revealing bilateral fibromatosis. Ki-67 expression was moderate. CONCLUSIONS: (99m)Tc-(V)DMSA scintimammography can provide information regarding the nature of the lesion, its extent and bilateral involvement (especially in dense breasts) and could prove useful as a predictor of its potential for recurrence."
"Peritoneal disease can manifest at computed tomography (CT) as fluid accumulation within the peritoneal cavity (ascites) or soft-tissue infiltration of the various peritoneal ligaments and mesenteries. Beyond the commonly encountered cases of typical ascites and peritonitis, there is a wide spectrum of uncommon nonneoplastic conditions that may involve the peritoneal and subperitoneal spaces. For example, systemic or organ-based diseases that occasionally involve the peritoneum include eosinophilic gastroenteritis, amyloidosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, Erdheim-Chester disease, sarcoidosis, and mesenteric cavitary lymph node syndrome. Tumorlike conditions that may affect the peritoneum include aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid), inflammatory pseudotumor, retractile mesenteritis, and Castleman disease. Atypical peritoneal infections include tuberculosis, actinomycosis, echinococcosis, Whipple disease, and mesenteric adenitis. Conditions involving the subperitoneal fat include epiploic appendagitis, mesenteric panniculitis, and segmental omental infarction, all of which have characteristic CT findings. CT is an excellent imaging modality for detection and characterization of peritoneal involvement from these unusual diseases."
"Fibromatosis is a rare soft tissue disease typical for infants and characterized by fibroblastic proliferation, which may appear similar to fibrosarcoma. An unusual case of 4-year old girl presenting large tumor of the neck with massive calcification is described. The growth of the tumor was rapid and mediastinal involvement was observed. The final diagnosis showed benign nature of tumor with microscopic features of fibromatosis calcificans. After surgical resection of neck tumor, residual mass persisted both in the neck and in the mediastinum in 6 years of follow-up without signs of progression."

"Many soft tissue tumors recapitulate features of normal connective tissue. We hypothesize that different types of fibroblastic tumors are representative of different populations of fibroblastic cells or different activation states of these cells. We examined two tumors with fibroblastic features, solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) and desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF), by DNA microarray analysis and found that they have very different expression profiles, including significant differences in their patterns of expression of extracellular matrix genes and growth factors. Using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization on a tissue microarray, we found that genes specific for these two tumors have mutually specific expression in the stroma of nonneoplastic tissues. We defined a set of 786 gene spots whose pattern of expression distinguishes SFT from DTF. In an analysis of DNA microarray gene expression data from 295 previously published breast carcinomas, we found that expression of this gene set defined two groups of breast carcinomas with significant differences in overall survival. One of the groups had a favorable outcome and was defined by the expression of DTF genes. The other group of tumors had a poor prognosis and showed variable expression of genes enriched for SFT type. Our findings suggest that the host stromal response varies significantly among carcinomas and that gene expression patterns characteristic of soft tissue tumors can be used to discover new markers for normal connective tissue cells."
"During the last 9 years we treated 14 patients with a diagnosis of intra-abdominal fibromatosis. The 11 patients who received an intestinal allograft included isolated intestine (n = 6), liver-intestine (n = 1), intestine-kidney (n = 1), multivisceral (n = 1), multivisceral-kidney (n = 1), multivisceral-no liver (n = 1). Three patients received an intestinal autograft after partial abdominal evisceration and ex vivo tumor resection. Three patients additionally underwent an abdominal wall allograft. RESULTS: At follow-up until August 2004, all autotransplant patients are alive. Four intestinal transplant patients died within the first postoperative month. There were three graft losses. A patient who lost his graft early postoperatively was retransplanted but died of sepsis shortly there after. Two more patients lost their graft due to severe rejection and were retransplanted successfully. Two patients developed desmoid tumor recurrence in their abdominal or thoracic wall. Ten patients are alive 1 to 9 years posttransplantation. Nine have fully functioning grafts and one patient requires TPN supplementation at night due to dysmotility of her autograft. CONCLUSION: Intestinal allo-, or autotransplantation combined with transplantation of the abdominal wall can be lifesaving for patients suffering from extensive intra-abdominal fibromatosis."
"Desmoid tumors are fibromatous lesions occurring both sporadically and in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Because of the association of these tumors with the hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome FAP we set out to define the molecular events driving desmoid tumorigenesis, hypothezising these might be identical to events driving colorectal tumorigenesis. We found that whereas FAP-associated desmoid tumors are caused by germline APC mutations followed by somatic inactivation of the wild-type APC allele, sporadic desmoids are usually characterized by oncogenic mutations in the b-catenin gene, both identical molecular alterations to those found in the vast majority of colorectal cancers. Next we set out to investigate the cellular pathways activated by these mutations, and identified activation of the Wnt signaling pathway in desmoid tumors. Wnt signaling modulates expression of developmental genes and cell fate via beta-catenin, and has been implicated in many cancer types. Currently we are investigating tissue-specific downstream effectors of the Wnt pathway that might be responsible for the behaviour of these invasive fibrous tumors. Our findings also point to a role for this pathway in the regulation of normal myofibroblast proliferation and suggest novel treatments in desmoid tumors and other fibrous proliferative disorders."
"Deep fibromatoses (desmoid tumors) are clonal myofibroblastic proliferations that are prone to aggressive local recurrences but that do not metastasize. They must be distinguished from a host of fibroblastic and myofibroblastic lesions as well as from smooth muscle neoplasms. Virtually all deep fibromatoses have somatic beta-catenin or adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutations leading to intranuclear accumulation of beta-catenin. Since low-grade sarcomas in general lack beta-catenin and since reactive proliferations would not be expected to have it, we predicted that nuclear beta-catenin expression would be detected in deep fibromatoses but absent in other entities in the differential diagnosis. We evaluated the role of beta-catenin to help differentiate distinguish deep fibromatoses from congeners. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections from 21 lesions from 20 patients with deep fibromatoses were stained with monoclonal beta-catenin antibody (Transduction Laboratories) and compared with low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (n=12), leiomyosarcoma (n=10), various other fibrosarcoma variants (n=13, including 3 myofibrosarcomas, 3 sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcomas, 5 low-grade fibrosarcomas, 1 classic fibrosarcoma arising in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, 1 inflammatory myxohyaline tumor/myxoinflammatory fibroblastic sarcoma), myofibroma/myofibromatosis (n=12), nodular fasciitis (n=11), and scars (n=9). Nuclear and cytoplasmic staining was assessed. All 21 examples of deep fibromatosis displayed nuclear beta-catenin (focal nuclear staining in one case to 90% staining). All other lesions tested (n=67) lacked nuclear labeling for beta-catenin, showing only cytoplasmic accumulation. beta-Catenin immunohistochemistry separates deep fibromatosis from entities in the differential diagnosis, a finding that can be exploited for diagnosis. Most fibromatoses have diffuse nuclear staining although occasional examples only focally label."
"We evaluated the usefulness of MR imaging for aggressive fibromatoses in order to determine tumor extent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 17 lesions of 16 patients were examined with a 1.5-Tesla MR unit with unenhanced and gadolinium-enhanced T1WI, and T2WI. We retrospectively reviewed the MR features. RESULTS: The tumor had a smooth margin in 41% of cases, while an irregular margin was present in 59%. A low signal intensity band (LSB) followed a normal muscle tendon or fascia. LSBs were seen in all of the lesions with an irregular margin, but not in those with a smooth margin. LSB resembled thickened or uneven tendons. Five of the seven lesions with LSB had a positive surgical margin at the LSB on pathological feature, and they recurred. CONCLUSION: Detection of LSBs on MR images is important for the determination of tumor extent, which allows the surgical method to be decided and postoperative recurrence predicted."
"A case- review describing a desmoid in a young female. The tumor originated at the tendinuous attachment of the m. rectus abdominis on the pubic bone, which had had two relapses. During the third--so far the latest--procedure it required left-sided hemipelvectomy with resection of the rectum and a part of the vagina. The patient was instructed about the serious character of the disease, the requirement for the radical resection and about the requirement for a careful long-term follow-up of the patient after the procedure."
"The purpose of this article is to review the pertinent literature and to define the optimal treatment of patients with aggressive fibromatosis. Data indicate the likelihood of local recurrence after surgery is high, particularly if margins are positive. Moderate-dose radiotherapy alone for gross disease or after a microscopically incomplete resection yields local control rates of approximately 75% to 80%. Treatment with pharmacologic agents results in objective response rates of approximately 40% to 50%; duration of response is variable. Thus, the optimal management for aggressive fibromatosis depends on tumor location and extent. Surgery is indicated if the lesion appears to be completely resectable with acceptable function and cosmesis. Radiotherapy is indicated for patients with unresectable tumors; those with positive margins after resection should be considered for adjuvant radiotherapy depending on the location and extent of the tumor. Pharmacologic treatment should be considered for patients with progressive disease after unsuccessful local-regional therapy."

"Desmoid tumors, also known as aggressive fibromatosis, occur with an incidence of 10 to 15 percent in patients affected by familial adenomatous polyposis, an autosomal inherited disease caused by germline mutations in the APC gene. However, sporadic forms with no hereditary background exist. The aim of this study was to find out whether there are APC germline mutations in apparently sporadic desmoid tumor patients without clinical or familial signs of familial adenomatous polyposis but with a family history of colorectal carcinoma in at least one family member. METHODS: Genomic DNA and mRNA were isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes of index patients of eight nonrelated families. Mutation screening was performed using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-based protein truncation test for APC exons 1-14. The large APC exon 15 was scrutinized by the protein truncation test of four overlapping genomic fragments. Additionally, genomic DNA from five desmoid tumors was analyzed for loss of heterozygosity at D5S346 close to the APC locus. RESULTS: No translational stop mutations typical for familial adenomatous polyposis could be found in the APC gene in any of the analyzed blood samples from the desmoid tumor patients. Additionally, no loss of heterozygosity at D5S346 was found in four of five desmoids; one tumor was not informative. CONCLUSIONS: These results may suggest that patients with sporadic desmoids and no clinical signs of familial adenomatous polyposis detected on careful examination, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and complete colonoscopy do not need to be tested routinely for germline mutations of the APC gene. However, as large studies dealing with this problem are absent, it might be more time and cost effective to perform an APC mutational analysis instead."
Desmoids are tumours of the connective tissue cells with aggressive growth. Frequent recurrences of these tumours have often been described. Genetic and endocrine factors as well as local tissue biomechanics are thought to be responsible for the pathogenesis. This case report should contribute to the discussion about possible pathogenetic factors.
"The value of the dynamic contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) in differentiating benign and malignant soft tissue tumors was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Turbo FLASH DCE-MRI was performed on 22 subjects (2-74 years) with soft tissue tumors. Enhancement in the first min (E(max/1)), second min (E(max/2)) and maximum peak enhancement (E(max)), and steepest slope were calculated. Discriminant analyses were performed to reveal parametric differences of benign and malignant lesions. RESULTS: Diagnosis of benign (N = 10) tumors were hemangioma (n = 3), neurogenic tumor (n = 3) lipoma (n = 2), giant cell tumor (n = 1) and desmoid (n = 1), whereas malignant lesions (N = 12) were classified as liposarcoma (n = 5), malignant fibrous histiocytoma (n = 5) and synovial sarcoma (n = 2). For malignant lesions E(max/1) was 65-198%, E(max/2) was 65-145%, E(max) was 78-198%, and steepest slope was 1.45-4.06. For benign lesions these values were 4-98%, 5-105%, 7-125% and 0.67-2.57, respectively. To determine the relation between the variables analysed, Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated. E(max) was found to be highly correlated with other variables (rxy > 0.86, P < 0.0001). Consequently, this variable was excluded from the discriminant analysis. In order to determine discrimination of malignant and benign tumors using E(max/1), E(max/2,) and steepest slope of the enhancement curve logistic regression was applied to the above mentioned data. When combined these parameters had a 95.5% of overall accuracy in classifying benign and malignant lesions (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: DCE-MRI parameters that thought to be the surrogate markers of tumoral microcirculation and tissue perfusion provides a specific preoperative diagnosis. Dynamic imaging parameters are therefore advocated for monitoring the effect of chemotherapy in soft tissue tumors."
"To identify early symptoms of familial adenomatous polyposis with a view to improve early diagnosis and treatment. Diagnosis on the basis of genetic testing is usually limited to where there is a known family history, so FAP is more usually diagnosed on clinical grounds. Except for those identified via FAP registers, the majority of patients are symptomatic at the time of diagnosis. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective study of 143 FAP patients treated at the Department of Surgery, University of Erlangen between 1971 and 2000. We identified patterns of symptoms, endoscopic findings and extracolonic manifestations in three age groups. RESULTS: FAP was diagnosed clinically on the basis of symptoms in 84% (120/143) of these patients. Most presented with intestinal symptoms such as colonic bleeding (68%) and diarrhea (42%). All but one of the patients between 20 and 40 years old had rectal polyps (98.7%, 75/76), whereas in those over 40 years old the prevalence was 76% (35/46). Non-specific symptoms such as abdominal pain, fatigue and bloating were less frequent and were mainly reported by patients older than 40. CONCLUSION: The commonest presenting features of FAP are alteration of bowel habit and rectal bleeding, but both are found in many other conditions. Patients with these findings need immediate endoscopy to allow prompt diagnosis and prophylactic surgery."
"Desmoid tumour is a benign, non metastasising neoplasm characterised by an elevated deposition of organic macromolecules in the extracellular matrix (ECM). The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent proteinases involved in the degradation of ECM macromolecules. The MMPs and their natural inhibitors (TIMPs) have been implicated in tumour growth, invasion and metastasis. In this study we provide evidence that the in vitro cultured cell line from desmoid tumour accumulates more collagen fibres in the ECM than healthy fibroblasts. METHODS: We investigated collagen accumulation by 3H-thymidine incorporation, MMP expression by substrate gel zymography and TIMP expression by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Desmoid fibroblasts showed a reduction in MMP activity and an increase of type I and III collagen and TIMPs compared to normal fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: The increase in collagen in desmoid fibroblasts was due to inhibited collagen degradation (reduction of MMP activity) rather than to increased collagen synthesis. Adding toremifene, an anti-estrogen triphenylethylene derivate, to desmoid fibroblasts reduced collagen accumulation by decreasing mRNA expression and increasing collagen degradation."
"This is a retrospective review of 146 surgically treated benign and malignant peripheral non-neural sheath tumors (PNNSTs). Tumor classifications with patient numbers, locations of benign PNNSTs, and surgical techniques and adjunctive treatments are presented. The results of a literature review regarding tumor frequencies are presented. METHODS: One hundred forty-six patients with 111 benign and 35 malignant PNNSTs were treated between 1969 and 1999 at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC). The benign tumors included 33 ganglion cysts, 16 cases of localized hypertrophic neuropathy, 12 lipomas, 12 tumors of vascular origin, and 11 desmoid tumors. There were four each of lipofibrohamartomas, myositis ossificans, osteochondromas, and ganglioneuromas; two each of meningiomas, cystic hygromas, myoblastoma or granular cell tumors, triton tumors, and lymphangiomas; and one epidermoid cyst. The locations of benign PNNSTs were the following: 33 in the brachial plexus region, 39 in an upper extremity, one in the pelvic plexus, and 38 in a lower extremity. The malignant PNNSTs included 35 surgically treated carcinomas, 15 of which originated in the breast and nine in the lung. There were two melanomas metastatic to nerve and one tumor each that had metastasized from the bladder, rectum, skin, head and neck, and thyroid, and from a primary Ewing sarcoma. There was a single lymphoma that had metastasized to the radial nerve and one chordoma and one osteosarcoma, each of which had metastasized to the brachial plexus. CONCLUSIONS: There were more benign PNNSTs than malignant ones. Benign tumors were relatively equally distributed in the brachial plexus region and upper and lower extremities, with the exception of the pelvic plexus, which had only one tumor."
"Restorative proctocolectomy eliminates the risk of colorectal cancer in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Complications and extra-intestinal manifestations are inherent to the procedure. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate operative procedures, complications, early and late results and long-term functional outcome in FAP patients operated in our department. METHODS: The study group included all patients with FAP who were operated between 1988 and 2003. Demographic data, length of follow-up, complications, colorectal cancer, pouch function and extracolonic manifestations were recorded. RESULTS: Median age at surgery was 33 years (range 13-61 years). The final operative breakdown was: 48 proctocolectomies, 41 ileal pouch-anal anastomoses, 2 Kock's pouch, 5 permanent ileostomies, and 2 colectomies with ileorectal anastomosis. There was no perioperative mortality. Early and late complications occurred in 20 and 9 patients, respectively. Twelve patients required reoperation. Colorectal carcinoma was diagnosed in eight patients, three of whom were in an advanced stage. The mean follow-up was 74 months (range 3-288 months). Four patients were lost to follow-up. Extracolonic manifestations developed in 38 patients, including desmoid tumors (in 12), duodenal adenomas (in 9), pouch adenomas (in 5), and rectal stump adenomas (in 3). Two patients died (4%) because of desmoid tumor and malignant fibrous histiocytoma. At last follow-up, 37 IPAA patients have (median) six bowel movements/24 hours and good fecal control. CONCLUSIONS: Restorative proctocolectomy can be performed with low mortality, acceptable morbidity, and good functional results. Patients should be closely followed after surgery for development of other manifestations of the syndrome. Relatives of the affected patients should be referred to a specialist multidisciplinary clinic."
"Extracolonic manifestations have a major effect on the morbidity and mortality of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis following proctocolectomy. DESIGN: Case review study. SETTING: Colorectal unit, university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Fifty patients (25 males and 25 females) with familial adenomatous polyposis WHO underwent proctocolectomy between January 1988 and October 2003. INTERVENTIONS: Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (n = 41), Kock pouch (n = 1), end ileostomy (n = 6). Two patients underwent total colectomy with an ileorectal anastomosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical follow-up and telephone interview; contact with clinicians following up patients elsewhere. RESULTS: The patients' median age at surgery was 33 years. The mean length of follow-up was 74 months. Four patients were lost to follow-up. Extracolonic manifestations were diagnosed in 38 patients (76%). Twelve patients had 14 desmoid tumors: 7 were treated surgically and 7 medically (these patients received celecoxib and tamoxifen citrate therapy). Of the 41 patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy, 11 developed duodenal and/or ampullary adenomas. Three patients had endoscopic polypectomy and 1 underwent a Whipple operation. Among the 29 patients who underwent pouchoscopy, 5 had pouch adenomas and 3 had adenomas that were found in the rectal stump. Two patients died--one of a huge mesenteric desmoid tumor and the other of an aggressive mesenteric malignant fibrous histiocytoma. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term morbidity and mortality were strongly related to the development of mesenteric tumors and ampullary-duodenal polyps. Early detection of desmoid tumors, duodenal, pouch, and rectal cuff adenomas by periodic computed tomography, gastroduodenoscopy, and pouchoscopy, respectively, may allow control by medical therapy, endoscopy, or limited surgical procedures. In most patients control of desmoid tumors was achieved using a combination of celecoxib and tamoxifen citrate therapy."
"After a general Patterns of Care Study (PCS) the German Cooperative Group on Radiotherapy for Benign Diseases (GCG-BD) initiated a multicenter cohort study to analyze the radiation therapy practice for aggressive fibromatosis. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 2002 a PCS was conducted in all German radiotherapy (RT) institutions by mailing a standardized structured questionnaire, to assess patients accrual, number, pretreatment, treatment indications, RT, and target volume concepts for irradiation in aggressive fibromatosis. In addition, the treatment outcome of individual patients was evaluated. The PCS was structured and analyzed according to the model for quality assessment by Donabedian in three major components: structure, process, and outcome evaluation. RESULTS: A total of 101 institutions returned the questionnaire: 52.7% reported satisfactory clinical data and experience for inclusion in this analysis. A total accrual rate of 278 patients per year was reported with median number of 2 cases (1-7 cases) per institution. Satisfactory data for a long-term clinical evaluation was reported for 345 patients from 19 different institutions. The applied total doses ranged between 36 and 65 Gy (median, 60 Gy). The local control rate was 81.4% in primary RT for unresectable tumors and 79.6% in postoperative RT. No acute or late radiation toxicities > Grade 2 (RTOG) were observed. No clear dose-response relationship could be established, but there was a tendency toward a lower local control rate in patients with a higher number of operative procedures before RT and patients treated for recurrent aggressive fibromatosis. CONCLUSIONS: This study comprises the largest database of cases reported for RT in aggressive fibromatosis. Radiotherapy provides a high local control rate in the postoperative setting and in unresectable tumors. This PCS may serve as a starting point for a national or international prospective multicenter study or registry, or both."
"An extensive tumour in a 7-year-old girl, leading to severe disfigurement, proved to be an aggressive fibromatosis on histological examination. Eighteen months after surgery there was no evidence of recurrent disease. This suggests that tumour resection and reconstruction of the mandible had been successful. Contrary to some reports, tumour resection led to curative therapy whereas radiotherapy failed."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a mesenchymal neoplasm associated with mutations, resulting in beta-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation. We found that plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) was upregulated fourfold in aggressive fibromatosis. We investigated the ability of beta-catenin to regulate a PAI-1 reporter, and found that PAI-1 is an indirect target. To determine the role of PAI-1 in vivo, a mouse containing a targeted deletion in Pai-1 was crossed with a mouse that develops aggressive fibromatosis and gastrointestinal tumors (Apc/Apc1638N mouse). Pai-1 deficiency reduced the number of aggressive fibromatosis tumors formed, but not the number of gastrointestinal tumors. Deficiency of Pai-1 reduced tumor cell proliferation and motility rate. Although PAI-1 can alter cell motility by competing for a common binding site on vitronectin, blocking this site did not alter the motility rate. The number of cells moving through matrigel (invasion rate) did not change with Pai-1 deficiency, but because of the low motility rate the invasion index (invasion rate/motility) was increased in Pai-1-deficient cells. This suggests a proteolytic effect for PAI-1 regulating cell invasiveness. Our study found that, although PAI-1 has cellular effects that could inhibit or enhance tumor growth, on balance, it acts as a tumor enhancer in aggressive fibromatosis."
"Fibromatosis (Desmoid tumor) of the male breast is an exceptional location. We present a case of such a tumor, in the context of Gardner's syndrome. A palpable mass was discovered in the right breast of a 52 years old man, with a history of rectocolic adenomatous polyposis. Mammography ant thoracic CT scan showed a stellar tumor, mimicking a breast cancer. Treatment consisted of wide excision and histology revealed a desmoid tumor. Desmoid tumors of the breast are benign lesions; they should be widely excised because of a high risk of recurrence. Coloscopy is indicated in the presence of mammary fibromatosis, to look for associated multiple polyps, confirming the diagnosis of Gardner's syndrome."
"A 29-year-old female was diagnosed with a symptomatic, extra-abdominal desmoid tumor during the first trimester of pregnancy. Computerized tomography (CT) and transabdominal ultrasound (US) noted a mass within the left rectus sheath measuring up to 15 cm in greatest diameter, with mild compression of the uterus. Preoperative diagnosis was confirmed by core-needle biopsy of the lesion. At 20-weeks gestation, wide local resection of the tumor with disease-free margins, as well as abdominal wall reconstruction with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) mesh was successfully undertaken. Histological examination of the tumor ex vivo confirmed that the lesion was a desmoid tumor consisting of spindle cells with dense infiltrating collagenous fibers. Subsequent to her resection, the patient completed a full-term pregnancy without complication, and proceeded with a complication-free transvaginal delivery at 39 weeks. This case illustrates the probable contribution of estrogens towards desmoid tumor development, the durability of abdominal wall reconstruction when subjected to the extraordinary strain of both a gravid uterus and labor, as well as the safety and efficacy of aggressive surgical therapy during pregnancy."
"0.17). Additional postoperatively applied radiotherapy proved to be statistically significant to avoid local recurrences (log-rank: 0.01). The presented results may indicate an increased risk for local relapse in those desmoid-type fibromatoses which are mitotically active. Postoperative radiotherapy seems to be effective in the treatment of aggressive fibromatosis to avoid tumor recurrence. Differential diagnosis of desmoid-type fibromatosis/aggressive fibromatosis in adulthood include various fibroblastic/myofibroblastic soft tissue tumors such as nodular fasciitis, fibrosarcoma, low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, myofibroblastic sarcoma as well as leiomyosarcoma and soft tissue leiomyoma."
"Desmoid tumors are rare tumors accounting for only 0.03% of all neoplasms. Mainly occurring in the fourth and fifth decades of life, these tumors originate in musculoaponeurotic tissues of the limbs, neck, trunk, abdominal wall, and mesentery. We present a rare case of a chest wall desmoid tumor that was mistaken for breast cancer on both physical examination and mammography, which highlights the unique risk these tumors present for confusion with other malignant processes. Although past literature contains numerous reports of other misdiagnoses, this case is unique in reporting the potential for misdiagnosis between chest wall desmoid tumors and breast cancer. In cases where suspicious breast findings do not correlate to usual diagnostic measures, such as fine-needle aspiration or core needle biopsy, the possibility of another pathology such as a chest wall desmoid tumor mimicking breast cancer should be considered in the differential diagnosis."
"Desmoid tumor of the breast is a rare lesion. So far only 8 cases in which the tumor origin was linked to a breast implant have been published. Whether there is an etiological relation to the silicone implant or if it is pure coincidence is not evident at this time. We present the case of a 24-year-old female with congenital asymmetric breasts who underwent breast augmentation in our division on the left side and 15 months later had a breast reduction on the other side. Nine years after the first operation we found a suspicious lesion on the side of the breast implant. The histological result of the excisional biopsy showed an aggressive fibromatosis ""arising from"" the capsule around the silicon implant. We discuss the possible association of breast implant and desmoid tumor of the breast and evaluate the diagnostic and therapeutic options for desmoid tumors of the breast."
"Desmoplastic fibroma is a rare primary tumor of bone that histologically and biologically mimics the extra-abdominal desmoid tumor of soft tissue. It usually presents in patients during the first three decades of life and often involves the mandible or long bones of the skeleton. Its clinical behavior is characterized by a locally aggressive, infiltrating, and destructing course, often with invasion of surrounding tissues but without metastasis. We present herein the clinicopathological features of a desmoplastic fibroma-like tumor involving the left maxillofacial region in a 14-year-old Hispanic boy with tuberous sclerosis."
"a desmoid tumour, which was excised."
"Desmoid tumors of the head and neck are locally invasive neoplasms with a high propensity for inadequate resection and recurrence. The rarity of these neoplasms accounts for the fact that there are no prospective randomized data to evaluate the influence of adjuvant therapies, including radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, or cytotoxic chemotherapy. Several comprehensive retrospective series in the literature suggest that the margin status following resection does not necessarily correlate with local disease recurrence. As a result, we do not advocate the sacrifice of major neurovascular structures in an attempt to obtain negative margins. We present a review of desmoid tumors, emphasizing those occurring in the head and neck, and describe 3 cases that highlight the challenges that the anatomy of the head and neck presents in the management of this difficult disease."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF), also known as desmoid tumor is a monoclonal fibroblastic proliferation in a collagen matrix that arises in musculoaponeurotic structures. Though considered as benign, they are locally invasive and their propensity for recurrence after conservative surgery is well documented. Addition of postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy produces higher local control rates, although recurrence rates are still high in patients with positive margins. The antineoplastic activity of vitamin D has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo models of several cancers. The proposed mechanisms for antineoplastic activity include inhibition of proliferation associated with cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis and reduction in invasiveness and angiogenesis. It has also been shown that vitamin D has a negative impact on collagen homeostasis by inhibiting the formation and increasing its degradation. Since vitamin D has an antineoplastic activity and negative effect on collagen synthesis and deposition, it is proposed that 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 can be a right therapeutic option for the management of desmoid tumors."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) involving the mandible is rare, and surgery is often complicated by a high recurrence rate. CASE REPORT: A 4-year-old boy was referred because of a fast growing painless mass which involved the entire left angle of the mandible. Excisional biopsy revealed AF, and local excision of the tumor was performed. Six months after surgery a recurrence was detected. The tumor was determined to be unresectable and the boy was treated with low-dose chemotherapy including methotrexate and vinblastine for 1 year. With combined chemotherapy and surgical debulking, mutilating surgical resection will be delayed as long as possible or until completion of facial growth. CONCLUSION: According to the literature, surgery is the most common treatment of AF in the head and neck region. However, particularly in children, alternative modes of therapy must be considered because of the high recurrence rate and to avoid mutilating operations."
"Patients with fibromatosis not amenable to surgery may suffer from high morbidity. Various chemotherapeutic regimens have been tried in these patients with limited success. Here, we report on the successful use of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in the treatment of 4 patients with unresectable fibromatosis in unfavorable localizations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 3 children and 1 adult with progressive fibromatosis were treated with 3-weekly cycles of chemotherapy with liposomal doxorubicin (dose range 20-50 mg/m2 per day every 21 days). Tumors were located at the nasal cavity, fossa infratemporalis, oral cavity, abdomen, and fossa supraclavicularis and were unresectable. 3 of the 4 patients had been heavily pretreated with various chemotherapeutic agents. Objective tumor response was monitored by magnetic resonance imaging and possible cardiotoxicity by echocardiography at regular intervals. RESULTS: A tumor response was obtained in all 4 patients. All patients showed normal cardiac function after completion of chemotherapy as evaluated by left ventricular shortening fraction. Severe neutropenia was not observed. CONCLUSION: Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin is a therapeutic option in patients with progressive unresectable fibromatosis in unfavorable localizations."
"Fibromatosis of the breast is a rare benign tumor that should be included in the differential diagnosis for breast cancer. It is usually indistinguishable from malignancy on ultrasound, mammography, physical examination, and on gross evaluation. Distinction is easily made by histologic findings. This benign tumor does not metastasize, but is locally aggressive and tends to recur postoperatively, which accounts for considerable morbidity. We present two cases and a discussion from the perspective of the radiologist, the surgeon, and the pathologist."

"Desmoid tumors (aggressive fibromatosis) are locally invasive soft tissue tumors in which beta-catenin/TCF3 mediated Wnt signaling is activated. More than 80% of desmoid tumors contain activating mutations in beta-catenin. It has been shown that the Wnt signaling pathway interacts with Wilms' tumor gene 1 (WT1) in normal kidney development and plays a role in the genesis of some Wilms' tumors. About 15% of Wilms' tumors contain WT1 mutations and of these, about 50% contain beta-catenin mutations. This overlap in mutation pattern of WT1 and beta-catenin in Wilms' tumor suggests that these 2 genes may collaborate in the genesis of a subset of Wilms' tumors. To investigate whether this hypothesis could be extended to other Wnt-dependent tumor types, we searched for WT1 mutations and studied WT1 expression in beta-catenin mutant desmoid tumors. We investigated the expression of WT1 mRNA and protein in desmoid tumors. Medium to high abundant levels of WT1 mRNA were detected by TaqMan quantitative PCR in all tested desmoid cells, whereas adjacent normal fibroblasts showed less expression of WT1. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry confirmed this overexpression at the protein level. A mutational screen of the WT1 zinc-finger region by sequence analysis did not identify any mutations. Finally, we investigated a possible role of beta-catenin on WT1 regulation and vice versa. Overexpression of different beta-catenin mutants in the HEK293T cell line did not modulate WT1 promoter activity and WT1 did not affect beta-catenin /TCF transcriptional activity in this cell line. These results show that the wild-type WT1 gene is strongly overexpressed in beta-catenin mutant desmoid tumors and may play a role in tumorigenesis of desmoid tumors, similar to what has been suggested in some epithelial malignancies."
A 28-year-old man with Gardner syndrome was admitted to our Department because of multiple abdominal masses. Abdominal computed tomography revealed severe hydronephrosis of both kidneys due to ureteral compression against the pelvic bones exerted by multiple solid abdominal masses. The patient developed oligoanuria. Right percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement was followed by restoration of diuresis and progressive recovery of renal function of the left side. The patient then underwent median laparotomy and removal of five large desmoid tumors originating from the abdominal wall. Bilateral ureteral obstruction due to abdominal desmoid tumors can be a rare urologic complication of Gardner syndrome.

"Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are thought to be responsible for bone formation; they cause bone to form in soft tissues and are clinically used in helping fracture union or tumor reconstructions. Skeletal metastases from epithelial tumors may be either bone-forming (blastic) or non-bone-forming (lytic). OBJECTIVE: We studied the expression of BMPs in a variety of primary and secondary lesions of bone (both bone-forming and non-bone-forming) to determine if there was a consistent relationship between bone formation and BMP expression. DESIGN: We compared a bone-forming lesion (fibrous dysplasia) with a non-bone-forming lesion (desmoid tumor), using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Northern blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry to detect BMPs. We also studied a number of non-bone-forming secondary lesions (carcinomas that formed lytic metastases to the skeleton) and found BMP production in most of these tumors. RESULTS: We found that BMPs were expressed in both bone-forming and non-bone-forming benign musculoskeletal lesions. In the first part of the study, BMPs were found in both fibrous dysplasia and desmoid tumors. Bone morphogenetic proteins were also expressed by several tumors. In the next part of the study (paraffin-embedded tissue), BMPs were expressed by a variety of tumors, irrespective of the radiological nature (blastic or lytic) of their metastases. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that BMP production alone cannot explain bone formation, and other factors either alone or in combination may be responsible for blastic metastases to the skeleton and for bone formation by primary bone lesions, such as fibrous dysplasia."

"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) is a rare soft-tissue tumour. It is histologically benign but locally aggressive and destructive. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment. This was a review of patients treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital between 1986 and 2003. METHODS: Records of patients with abdominal wall (23) and limb or limb girdle (86) AF were studied to determine patient, tumour and treatment characteristics and outcome. Children and patients with intra-abdominal AF were excluded. The data were analysed by Cox regression to calculate univariate hazard ratios. RESULTS: Twenty-one (19.3 per cent) of 109 patients developed recurrence after a median follow-up of 39 months. Recurrence did not correlate with surgical margin or any other variable. CONCLUSION: Wide excisional, function-preserving surgery is the goal in treatment of AF. Surgery for recurrent disease is often curative. Tumours are frequently irresectable at presentation and an initial period of expectant observation is advisable because growth arrest is a common feature of the disease."
"Selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are compounds with a mixed agonist/antagonist activity on oestrogen receptors. An ideal SERM is a compound with an oestrogen antagonist effect on the breast and uterus but oestrogen agonist effect on bone. Beside tamoxifen, a group of well-investigated SERMs is represented by raloxifene, LY-353381 (SERM3), EM-800 and CP-336156. On an empirical basis, tamoxifen has been used to pharmacologically treat desmoid tumours. Recently, raloxifene, a second-generation SERM, has been used in the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis patients affected by desmoid tumour. The mechanisms through which these molecules affect desmoid tumour growth appear to be due, in part, to the fact that SERMs may act independently of oestrogen receptors. The knowledge of the molecular basis of SERM action will make the development of novel synthetic compounds with engineered tissue selectivity possible."

"We are analyzing our experience with treatment of desmoid tumors of the chest wall and adjacent structures. METHODS: A retrospective review was undertaken of the records of all patients who underwent surgical management for a desmoid tumor of the chest between January 1980 and December 2001 at one institution. Fifty-three patients (24 men and 29 women) were identified, whose median age was 39 years (range 10 to 78 years). RESULTS: The desmoid tumor involved the chest wall exclusively in 25 patients (47%) and both the chest wall and adjacent structures in 28 (53%). Twenty-eight patients (53%) had previous resections for a desmoid tumor. Three patients also had previous radiation therapy. A wide radical resection was attempted in all 53 patients; resection was complete in 44. Seven patients had positive microscopic margins and 2 had gross residual disease. Complications were noted in 6 patients (11%); no operative deaths occurred. Median hospitalization was 6 days (range 1 to 124 days). Nineteen patients (36%) had postoperative radiation therapy (12 had complete resection and 7 had positive margins). Follow-up was complete in 51 patients (96%) and ranged from 2 weeks to 21 years (median 53 months). At the end of the review 46 patients were alive with no recurrence; 3 were alive with local recurrence and 2 died (1 from metastatic breast cancer and 1 from unknown cause). Five-year overall probability of developing a local recurrence was 37.5% (95% confidence interval, 20.2% to 53.3%). Recurrence occurred in 8 of 9 patients with positive margins (89%) and 8 of 44 with negative margins (18%). Factors adversely affecting the rate of postoperative recurrence were reoperation (p = 0.0199), positive margins (p < 0.0001), and postoperative radiation therapy (p = 0.0027). Eleven patients (22%) required reoperation at a median of 24.6 months postoperatively (range 11 to 78 months). CONCLUSIONS: Desmoid tumors involving the chest and adjacent structures are locally aggressive tumors with a high recurrence rate. Wide radical resection should be attempted whenever possible. Positive margins at resection, reoperation and postoperative radiation are associated with a high risk of local recurrence."
"Fibromatosis or desmoid tumor covers a broad spectrum of benign fibrous tissue proliferations. It is characterized by infiltrative growth and a tendency towards recurrence; however, unlike sarcoma, it never metastasizes. CASE PRESENTATION: We report on a case of extraabdominal fibromatosis originating from the retroperitoneal space in a 43-year-old woman. Seven years earlier she had undergone ureterolysis and ureteroureterostomy for ureteral obstruction. Computed tomography revealed a tumor between the iliocostalis and the psoas muscle. Histopathological evaluation revealed uniform proliferation of spindle cells, with a moderate amount of collagen fibers, suggesting extraabdominal fibromatosis (desmoid tumor). The tumor was surgically resected, and since then, the patient has remained asymptomatic without any restrictions of daily living activities and without any signs of tumor recurrence during the two-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Complete resection is the treatment of choice. Adjuvant therapy using non steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, tamoxifen, interferon, anti-neoplastic agents, and radiotherapy, either alone or in combination finds application for unresectable or recurrent cases."
This report presents a case of malignant granular cell tumor in the deltoid muscle and emphasizes the correlation between magnetic resonance (MR) images and pathological findings. A 71-year-old woman developed an elastic hard mass at the left shoulder. MR images revealed a soft tissue tumor with a maximum diameter of 5 cm and low signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images. The lesion with decreased signal intensity on all the images correlated with marked fibrosis mimicking desmoid tumor. Contrast-enhanced MR images provided useful information regarding the choice of biopsy site.
"Total clavicle reconstruction is a challenging task. We performed a reconstruction of the ventral shoulder girdle by calculating a 3D DICOM representation of the left clavicle to create a right neo-clavicle. Two cuts in correct position and angle leads to a natural 3D shape of the new clavicle. The data were used with a thermo-jet procedure to form model slices of thermoplastic wax. Subsequently, the double titanium osteotomy template with correct cut-angulation was constructed. A 40-year old patient presented with symptoms of progressive pain and instability in the shoulder girdle resulting from complete right clavicle resection due to desmoid tumour 23 years earlier. During the operative procedure, dissection, guided double osteotomy, microvascular anastomoses and acromioclavicular-sternoclavicular fixation were performed. The computer-assisted planning resulted in the exact calculation of the two osteotomy cuts, hence, the 3D appearance of the neo-clavicle. Two years postoperatively, patient showed slightly improved elevation and complete recovery from pain. Our operative procedure demonstrates that the computer-assisted planning with construction of a wax model and an osteotomy template is a useful approach to plan the two precise cuts leading to a predictable shape of the clavicle."
"18-86). The male/female ratio was 15/13. The most common subtypes was rhabdomyosarcoma (seven cases). Twenty-two patients presented with previous inadequate resection performed elsewhere before admission. The most common location was neck muscles (11 cases). Nineteen patients had surgery (complete resection in 13 cases). Associated treatments were neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy and postoperative radiotherapy in respectively, 4, 3 and 10 cases. The 2-year overall survival was 56%. Rhabdomyosarcomas (p = 0.005) and inadequate resection (p = 0.04) were associated with poor outcome. Large resection of AHNSTS in a multimodality approach may afford the best chance of disease control."
"Beta-catenin is a crucial part of the Wnt and E-cadherin signalling pathways, which are involved in tumorigenesis. Dysregulation of these pathways allow beta-catenin to accumulate and translocate to the nucleus, where it may activate oncogenes. Such nuclear accumulation can be detected by immunohistochemistry, which may be useful in diagnosis. Although the role of beta-catenin has been established in various types of carcinomas, relatively little is known about its status in mesenchymal tumors. A number of studies suggest that beta-catenin dysregulation is important in desmoid-type fibromatosis, as well as in synovial sarcoma. We wished to determine whether nuclear beta-catenin expression is specific to and sensitive for particular bone and soft-tissue tumors, including sporadic desmoid-type fibromatosis. We studied the nuclear expression of beta-catenin using tissue microarrays in a comprehensive range of bone and soft-tissue tumor types. A total of 549 cases were included in our panel. Nuclear immunohistochemical staining was determined to be either high level (>25% of cells), low level (0-25%) or none. High-level nuclear beta-catenin staining was seen in a very limited subset of tumor types, including desmoid-type fibromatosis (71% of cases), solitary fibrous tumor (40%), endometrial stromal sarcoma (40%) and synovial sarcoma (28%). Although occasional cases of fibrosarcoma, clear cell sarcoma and carcinosarcoma had high-level staining, no high-level nuclear beta-catenin expression was seen in any of 381 fibrohistocytic, muscular, adipocytic, chondroid or osseous tumor cases representing 42 diagnostic categories. All primary immunostain tissue microarray images are made publicly accessible in a searchable database. High-level nuclear beta-catenin staining serves as a useful diagnostic tool, as it is specific to a small subset of mesenchymal tumors."
"Infantile fibromatosis is an uncommon, usually cutaneous, nonmetastasizing but locally aggressive fibroblastic proliferation. Involvement of the sinonasal area is extremely uncommon, and only 5 cases have been previously reported. We report a new case, which occurred in a 2-year-old boy. The mass involved the nasal cavity and the paranasal sinuses and extended into the cranial cavity. We also discuss the clinicopathologic features of this lesion, including its ultrastructural characteristics, and we review the literature."
"Desmoids, also known as aggressive fibromatoses, are locally invasive tumors that are intermediate in their biological behavior that lies between benign fibrous proliferations and low-grade fibrosarcomas. In this report, we present a case of a young female patient with a huge tumoral mass located in the right shoulder region that recurred after total resection and was resistant to radio-chemo-hormonal therapy. Eventually, she responded to 1,25-(OH)(2)-vitamin D(3) treatment."
"Infantile fibromatosis is a rare entity in children. Although the cervical region is one of the frequent sites of location for this tumor, the diagnosis may be delayed if it occurs in a usual location for a well-known entity, such as muscular torticollis or fibromatosis colli. The authors present an infant with infantile desmoid fibromatosis of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which has been considered initially as olive of muscular torticollis."
"Aggressive intraabdominal fibromatosis is a rare response to surgical trauma. Characteristic is the local destroying growth. Only an operation in the purpose of R0-resection ends in cure. We report on a 29-year-old man, who developed intraabdominal fibromatosis as reaction to surgical trauma 19 years after appendectomy and subsequent to several relaparotomies due to adhesions. A huge conglomeratumor which included the ileum and the colon acsendens resulted in bowel obstruction and ileus. Complete surgical removal of the tumor lead after a primary complicated course to recovery."
"A 76-year-old male patient complained of frequent urination. Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed a heterogeneous mass involving his bladder, prostate and Sigmoid colon. He was diagnosed with an invasive urachal tumor and surgery was performed due to severe tumor adhesion to adjacent organs. Partial resection of the tumor was performed with partial cystectomy and sigmoidectomy. A post-operative pathological diagnosis revealed the tumor was a desmoid abdominal wall tumor. The desmoid abdominal wall tumor was not easily differentiated preoperatively from an urachal tumor."
"Sarcomas represent a heterogeneous group of diseases of a variety of recognized histologic types. Among these subtypes is malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), a diagnosis no longer recognized as a specific diagnosis at some institutions. In this study, gene expression in 38 histologically well-defined sarcoma samples, 17 MFH samples, 12 samples of sarcomas classified simply as high-grade sarcoma (NOS, standing for ""not otherwise specified""), and 26 other mesenchymal tumors was determined at Gene Logic Inc (Gaithersburg, MD), with the use of Affymetrix GeneChip U_133 arrays containing approximately 40,000 known genes and expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Gene-expression analysis was performed with the use of the Gene Logic Gene Express(R) Software System. Differences in gene expression were quantified as the fold change in gene expression between the various sets of well-defined sarcomas. A set of genes was then identified that could be used to distinguish the well-defined sets of 11 liposarcomas, 9 leiomyosarcomas, 4 synovial sarcomas, 8 schwannomas, and 12 cases of aggressive fibromatosis through the use of Eisen clustering. Eisen clustering was then repeated with the same set of gene fragments with the sample set of 38 histologically well-defined sarcomas, the 17 sarcomas classified as MFH, 12 sarcomas classified as high-grade sarcoma (NOS), and 26 other mesenchymal tumors. Under these conditions, each of the samples of well-defined sarcoma formed distinct clusters that contained some of the MFH and NOS samples. In addition, distinct clusters were observed that contained only MFH and NOS samples. We conclude that gene-expression patterns may be useful in helping further classify subtypes of sarcomas."
"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) regulate the degradation of extracellular matrix components and play important roles in the progression of select neoplastic processes. The locally invasive soft tissue tumor, aggressive fibromatosis (also called desmoid tumor), is caused by mutations resulting in beta-catenin-mediated T-cell factor (tcf)-dependent transcriptional activity. Because beta-catenin can regulate MMP expression, we investigated the expression of several MMPs and TIMPs in aggressive fibromatosis tumors that develop in Apc+/Apc1638N mice. Mmp-3 and Timp-1 were differentially regulated (5-fold and 0.5-fold, respectively) in tumors compared with normal fibrous tissue. Conditioned media from tumor cells showed an increased ability to degrade collagen, and inhibition of MMPs using GM6001 decreased the ability of the tumor cells to invade through Matrigel. Both the treatment of Apc/Apc1638N mice with GM6001 or crossing with a transgenic mouse that overexpresses Timp-1 resulted in a significant reduction in tumor volume. Surprisingly, overexpression of Timp-1 also resulted in a 50% increase in tumor number. Although TIMP-1 can induce growth stimulatory effects in some cell types, we found no difference in proliferation or apoptosis rate in cells from tumors that developed in the Timp-1-transgenic mice compared with mice that did not express the Timp-1 transgene, suggesting that TIMP-1 promotes aggressive fibromatosis tumor formation through an alternate mechanism. These data suggest that MMPs play a crucial role in regulating the invasiveness of mesenchymal cells and in modulating aggressive fibromatosis tumor progression. Because this is a locally invasive tumor, MMP inhibition could slow tumor growth and may prove to be an effective adjuvant therapy."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is the name for uncommon soft-tissue neoplasms arising within musculoaponeurotic tissue. They show benign histologic features but have an aggressive local behaviour and frequently recur after surgery or radiation. A 48-year-old black woman presented with recurrent aggressive fibromatosis after primary radiotherapy in the left temporal fossa involving the base of the skull. The patient received interferon alpha2a subcutaneously for 6 months. A slow but steady reduction of the tumour was observed, and pre-existing symptoms disappeared."

"The primary goal of treatment for desmoid tumors is complete surgical resection to achieve negative margins. In adults with unresectable or recurrent lesions, treatment options include noncytotoxic and cytotoxic drugs, but little is known about nonsurgical treatment in children. Between 1992 and 2003 six children (four girls, two boys) with a median age of 2.5 years (range 11 months to 9 years) received multimodal adjuvant therapy for unresectable or recurrent desmoid tumors. Primary treatment consisted of noncytotoxic treatment with tamoxifen (1 mg/kg orally, twice daily) and diclofenac (2 mg/kg rectally, twice daily), whereas two children with life-threatening tumor progression in addition received treatment intensification with weekly vinblastine (6 mg/m intravenously) and methotrexate (30 mg/m intravenously). Of the four children with unresectable tumors, two achieved remarkable tumor shrinkage and two had stable disease, whereas two patients were disease-free for 3.7 and 2.6 years after nonradical resection. Median observation time was 3.1 years (range 1-11 years). Treatment was generally well tolerated; only one patient developed pubertal acceleration after a duration of tamoxifen treatment of 9.3 years. Because of the potential life-threatening situation, the management of children with unresectable or recurrent desmoid tumors requires a multidisciplinary approach. Nonaggressive therapy with tamoxifen and diclofenac may be the first treatment choice in these patients, but in patients with progressive disease, cytotoxic chemotherapy is indicated. Weekly administration of vinblastine and methotrexate seems to be safe and effective in these children."

"Ovarian fibromatosis is a very rare nonneoplastic disease. Due to the rarity and atypical clinical presentations, they may give rise to a misdiagnosis of malignancy and unnecessary extensive surgical interventions. Literature lacks definitive data about this rare disease and its preoperative evaluations. MRI together with the intraoperative frozen section may help us to define the benign nature of the disease. In this report, we aimed to review the literature and give a highlight to the gynecologic oncologists about this rare disease. CASE HISTORY: A 19-year-old female patient admitted to our hospital with the complaints of menstrual irregularity, hirsutism, and increased abdominal girth. Physical examination revealed bilateral ovarian mass, hirsutism, and ascites. Serum CA-125 levels were slightly elevated. Preoperative MRI study showed bilateral hypointense lobulated ovarian masses. With the initial diagnosis of ovarian tumor, we performed explorative laparotomy and excised both masses. Final pathology was reported as bilateral ovarian fibromatosis. CONCLUSION: Ovarian fibromatosis commonly presents with ascites and solid pelvic mass and can be misdiagnosed as a malignant ovarian tumor. In young patients, clinicians should consider ovarian fibromatosis in differential diagnosis of pelvic mass. Preoperative MRI findings and intraoperative frozen examination may be used to avoid unnecessary aggressive surgical management."
"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. We describe here for the first time a patient with a huge GIST of the abdominal wall without any relation to the gastrointestinal tract, omentum, or mesentery. With regard to the size of 24 cm and a low mitotic index, this GIST is considered an intermediate risk for metastasis. Radical surgical resection was performed with negative pathologic resection margins. The classic immunohistochemical phenotype of the tumor described facilitates the differential diagnosis to exclude abdominal desmoid tumor and solitary fibrous tumor (SFT). In the case of metastasis, therapeutic nihilism no longer seems justified with the availability of imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which shows encouraging results in the therapy of metastatic GIST."
"Musculoaponeurotic fibromatosis or desmoid tumors are rare. We report the case of a 57 year old woman with a slowly growing tumor behind the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which was completely removed. Histological examination confirmed the clinical suspicion of a desmoid tumor. Desmoid tumors are aggressive, locally infiltrating, non-metastasizing tumors with a high local recurrence. Genetic, endocrine and physical factors have been implicated as causative agents. The diagnosis is made histologically, reactive fibromatosis and fibrosarcoma must be eliminated in differential diagnosis. By the combination of different radiographic techniques, it is possible to describe the tumors and differentiate between vessels, nerves and bones. The therapy of the choice is the surgical resection. Adjuvant therapy, such as x-ray treatment, chemo- and hormone therapy, are indicated when the tumor is inoperable or too extensive for surgery."
"Abnormalities of the urachus are rare among children and include a patent tract and cyst formation. These structures can also be affected by infection and abscess development. They are usually diagnosed during infancy and treated by surgical resection. Involvement of this remnant by either benign or malignant tumors is very infrequent. A few cases of mesenchymal tumors, such as desmoid tumor and leiomyoma, involving the urachus have been described in published reports. METHODS: We studied an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor arising from the urachus in a 10-year-old boy. In addition, we reviewed 101 cases of urachal remnants retrieved from the surgical pathology and autopsy files in the Department of Pathology at the Children's Hospital Boston diagnosed in the past 82 years. RESULTS: The urachal inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor showed anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization techniques. No other neoplasms were diagnosed in the analyzed population. CONCLUSIONS: We describe an example of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor involving the urachus. Involvement of the urachus by tumors is rare, but these should be considered in the differential diagnosis of urachal lesions."
"We report the case of a 62-year-old woman with a recurrent desmoid tumor of the chest wall who successfully underwent a full-thickness chest wall resection as well as skeletal and soft tissue reconstruction. In chest wall reconstruction, we used various kinds of autologous tissue grafts, i.e. rib, fascia lata and the transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap. Judging from the reconstructed wall's strength, shape and flexibility, as well as wound healing, it is possible to conclude that this combined procedure is feasible because benefits of the procedure outweigh the disadvantage of additional operations for harvests."
"(1) patients with FAP who have undergone prior subtotal colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis have a high risk of developing advanced cancer in the rectal stump; (2) duodenal adenomas are common in patients with FAP and may occur at an early age; (3) screening duodenoscopy should be initiated at the time of diagnosis of FAP; (4) local excision of duodenal adenomas is associated with a high risk of local recurrence; and (5) even though pancreaticoduodenectomy is the treatment of choice for advanced duodenal adenomas, this procedure may adversely affect pouch function in some patients."
"To confirm the usefulness of an immunohistochemical panel of antibodies for KIT (c-kit/CD117), CD34, desmin, smooth-muscle actin (SMA), h-caldesmon (HCD), S-100 protein, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and beta-catenin, 297 mesenchymal and peripheral nerve-sheath tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and intra-abdominal locations including 211 gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), 12 leiomyomas, 18 leiomyosarcomas, 17 solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs), 14 schwannomas, and 25 desmoid-type fibromatoses (DTFs) were analyzed immunohistochemically. Consistent (100%) immunoreactivity for KIT, CD34, desmin and S-100, and nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin were detected in GISTs, SFTs, smooth-muscle tumors, schwannomas, and DTFs, respectively. Immunoreactivity for SMA, HCD, and NSE was observed in a wide range of these tumors. In addition, 418 bone and soft tissue tumors were enrolled in this study for KIT immunostaining. As a result, a limited number of these tumors were KIT positive, including synovial sarcoma that showed morphological similarity to GISTs. These findings suggest that KIT, CD34, desmin, S-100, and beta-catenin are key markers for clinical diagnosis of GISTs and other spindle cell tumors that may involve the gastrointestinal tract, whereas SMA, HCD, and NSE have only limited value."
"We recently characterized gene expression patterns in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) using cDNA microarrays, and found that the gene FLJ10261 (DOG1, discovered on GIST-1), encoding a hypothetical protein, was specifically expressed in GISTs. The immunoreactivity of a rabbit antiserum to synthetic DOG1 peptides was assessed on two soft tissue tumor microarrays. The tissue microarrays included 587 soft tissue tumors, with 149 GISTs, including 127 GIST cases for which the KIT and PDGFRA mutation status was known. Immunoreactivity for DOG1 was found in 136 of 139 (97.8%) of scorable GISTs. All seven GIST cases with a PDGFRA mutation were DOG1-positive, while most of these failed to react for KIT. The immunohistochemical findings were confirmed with in situ hybridization probes for DOG1, KIT, and PDGFRA. Other neoplasms in the differential diagnosis of GIST, including desmoid fibromatosis (0 of 17) and Schwannoma (0 of 3), were immunonegative for DOG1. Only 4 of 438 non-GIST cases were immunoreactive for DOG1. DOG1, a protein of unknown function, is expressed strongly on the cell surface of GISTs and is rarely expressed in other soft tissue tumors. Reactivity for DOG1 may aid in the diagnosis of GISTs, including PDGFRA mutants that fail to express KIT antigen, and lead to appropriate treatment with imatinib mesylate, an inhibitor of the KIT tyrosine kinase."
"Hereditary gingival fibromatosis is a rare, genetically inherited overgrowth condition that is clinically characterized by a benign fibrous enlargement of maxillary and mandibular keratinized gingiva. A syndromic association between gingival fibromatosis and a wide variety of other genetically inherited disorders has been described. However, its coexistence with aggressive periodontitis has not been reported. METHODS: A 24-year-old African-American female, patient (proband X, [Px]) reported with a chief complaint of tooth mobility and gingival enlargement. Clinical examination revealed moderate to severe gingival overgrowth on both mandible and maxilla. Generalized attachment loss and mobility of the teeth were observed. Radiographic evaluation demonstrated severe alveolar bone loss. The patient was diagnosed with gingival fibromatosis and aggressive periodontitis based on the clinical and radiographic findings. Her brother (Bx) and her mother (Mx) were evaluated and diagnosed with gingival fibromatosis suggesting that this is a dominant trait in the family and gingival fibromatosis might be of hereditary origin. In addition, the brother also exhibited localized aggressive periodontitis. Medical history revealed no other systemic or local contributory factors associated with the oral findings in any of the subjects. RESULTS: Surgical therapy included internal bevel gingivectomy combined with open flap debridement procedures for Px and Bx. Only internal bevel gingivectomy was performed for Mx since there was mild bone resorption and no intrabony defects. At the time of surgery, gingival biopsies were obtained and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Multiple serial sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Microscopic evaluation of the gingival specimens revealed large parallel collagen bundles associated with scarce fibroblasts in the connective tissue. The collagen bundles reached into the subepithelial connective tissue where elongated rete-pegs were also observed. Following the completion of the treatment, no signs of recurrence or bone resorption were observed over 2-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of hereditary gingival fibromatosis associated with aggressive periodontitis. Combined treatment comprising removal of fibrotic gingival tissue and traditional flap surgery for the elimination of intrabony defects represents a unique treatment approach in periodontal therapy. Two-year follow-up revealed that both the gingival overgrowth and the destructive lesions were successfully treated."

"Elastofibroma dorsi is a pseudotumoral fibroproliferative lesion characterized by polymorphic fiber-like deposits of elastinophilic material. Several theories have been reported explaining the pathogenesis of elastofibroma. Recent cytogenetic studies have demonstrated chromosomal instability in elastofibromas, not normally observed in non-neoplastic tissues. These chromosomal defects are commonly observed in aggressive fibromatosis too. Such clinical observations suggest a multistage pathogenetic mechanism for the onset of elastofibroma. This study, using histochemical, immunohistochemical staining techniques, and ultrastructural examination, describes the detection of an otherwise typical elastofibroma contextual to a high grade sarcoma. Hence, the coexistence of elastofibroma and high-grade sarcoma may suggest a causal link between the two pathological entities. The results obtained suggest that the coexistence of the two pathological entities is conceivably coincidental."
"Myofibroblasts are mesenchymal cells with combined function and structure for contraction and collagen synthesis. They are found in reparative responses, nodular fasciitis, fibromatosis, and myofibroblastic sarcoma. Ultrastructurally, myofibroblasts are characterized by a specialized cell surface structure called the fibronexus (FNX). In addition, intracellular collagen fibers (ICF) have been described in nodular fasciitis and fibromatosis, but their origin and nature are still controversial. The aim of the present work was, first, to assess the frequency of FNX and ICF in proliferative myofibroblastic conditions compared to diverse mesenchymal tumors with spindle-shaped cells, and, second, to determine what kind of organelles contain ICF and if they are related to phagocytosis or cell synthesis. Forty-two cases of aggressive fibromatosis and 11 of nodular fasciitis (group A) were compared to 82 spindle-cell mesenchymal tumors of diverse nature (group B) by electron microscopy study. The presence and frequency of FNX and ICF was compared in both groups, and the organelles containing ICF were recorded. FNX and ICF were constantly found in group A (69.8 and 84.9%, respectively), and rarely in group B (0 and 5.12%, respectively). Most frequently ICF were contained in tunnels and phagolysosomes, but also were found in Golgi vesicles and cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum. In the majority of cases (75%), ICF were similar to collagen fibers of the extracellular space, but in some cases (22.5%), they were in dissimilar stages of fibrogenesis. Fibromatosis and nodular fasciitis are characterized by proliferation of myofibroblasts and constantly show FNX and ICF. These structures are rarely found in other mesenchymal tumors. The ICF are found in organelles of digestion and also in others related to synthesis and transport."
"There are limited data regarding how many patients with desmoid tumors actually represent cases with underlying familial adenomatous polyposis. METHODS: A proband presenting with desmoid tumors and several of the family members underwent a detailed family history, genetic (adenomatous polyposis coli [APC] gene sequencing), and upper and lower endoscopic evaluation. RESULTS: The proband's initial diagnosis was of a sporadic desmoid tumor. Colonoscopy was entirely normal. However, on subsequent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, several gastric polyps were found. The proband's mother subsequently underwent colonoscopy and was found to have multiple colon adenomas. On genetic analysis, a deletion of ""T"" was identified at codon 2645 of the APC gene in the proband. The proband's mother had a normal APC protein truncation test result. However, on full gene sequencing, the mother was found to harbor the same APC gene mutation. CONCLUSION: A detailed family history and endoscopic and genetic evaluations for patients with desmoid tumors are vital because they may be the sentinel presentation of familial adenomatous polyposis. If confirmed in larger studies, APC full gene sequencing and upper and lower gastrointestinal tract evaluation may need to be part of standard evaluation of patients with abdominal desmoid tumors."
"This article gives a presentation of a variety of surgical cases of peripheral nerve tumors for illustration and discussion. The first three cases include a schwannoma, a neurofibroma, and a desmoid tumor of the brachial plexus region. Case 4 is that of a patient with a common peroneal ganglion cyst, and case 5 is that of a patient with an angiolipoma of the forearm. Cases 6 through 8 illustrate a plexiform neurofibroma, a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and a metastatic carcinoma to the brachial plexus region. In case 9, a patient with schwannomatosis was treated for multiple spinal schwannomas."
"The surgical management of benign PNSTs and some other benign tumors can result in successful outcomes. Schwannomas and nonplexiform neurofibromas can be resected with minimal deficit by sparing all but the fascicles entering and exiting the tumor. These fascicles, if not functional by NAP testing, can be resected, and the tumor can be removed. Surgery to remove other benign lesions, such as intraneural ganglion cysts, hemangiomas,and ganglioneuromas, has become more timely. The desmoid tumor, although microscopically benign, is locally and regionally invasive, and chemotherapy and radiation therapy may need to be used as adjunctive therapy. Neurogenic sarcomas and other malignancies have high morbidity and mortality despite aggressive limb ablation or limb-sparing surgery with adjunctive therapy. Thus, surgery involving decompression as well as the most complete resection possible remains the essential initial step in the management of most malignancies."
"The authors report on the treatment of primary brachial plexus tumors in 25 patients at the University of California, San Francisco. They compare their findings with those obtained in similar series. METHODS: The authors reviewed the electronic and medical records, radiological images, operative reports, and pathological findings in 25 consecutive cases of primary brachial plexus tumors. Cases of metastatic lesions or adjacent neoplasms extending into and involving the brachial plexus were excluded. At presentation patients ranged in age from 19 to 71 years (mean 47-15 years), and neurofibromatosis was present in eight patients (32%). Presenting signs and symptoms included palpable mass (60%), numbness/paresthesias (44%), radiating pain (44%), local pain (16%), and weakness (12%). Duration of symptoms ranged from 2 months to 10 years. Neuroimaging revealed lesions ranging widely in size (volume approximately 1 to 100 ml). Pathological diagnoses included schwannoma (15 [60%]), neurofibroma (five [20%]), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (four [16%]), and desmoid tumor (one [4%]). CONCLUSIONS: Primary tumors arising in the brachial plexus are rare. Careful workup, surgical technique, and attention to pathological diagnosis optimize management."
"The sensitivity of human tumor tissues to infection with recombinant adenoviruses correlates with the expression of the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR). CAR has been shown to function as the primary receptor for adenoviruses and to play a critical role in adenovirus entry into host cells. It is important for clinical gene therapy to determine the expression level of CAR in tumor tissues. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed the expression of CAR mRNA in 154 musculoskeletal tumor tissues from 154 patients and 10 normal mesenchymal tissues from 3 patients using reverse transcription-PCR and real-time quantitative PCR. An adenovirus infection assay was performed in two cell lines that were established from CAR-positive osteosarcoma tissue and CAR-negative malignant fibrous histiocytoma tissue. RESULTS: Ninety-nine of 154 tumors were detected as CAR positive by reverse transcription-PCR. We found that the expression levels of CAR mRNA varied markedly between different tumors as determined by real-time quantitative PCR. CAR mRNA was expressed at high levels in osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, neurofibroma, and schwannoma; at intermediate levels in exostosis, giant cell tumor, liposarcoma, synovial sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and hemangioma; and at low levels in alveolar soft part sarcoma and desmoid. Whereas the osteosarcoma cell line that expressed a high level of CAR mRNA, like its parent tumor, had a high efficiency of adenovirus infection, the malignant fibrous histiocytoma cell line with almost undetectable expression of CAR mRNA, like its parent tumor, had a low efficiency of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed the great variations in CAR mRNA expression among human musculoskeletal tumors and mesenchymal tissues and implicated the potential usefulness of adenoviral vectors in gene therapy for osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, neurofibroma, and schwannoma. Efficient transduction with adenovirus for gene therapy could be realized in appropriate, sensitive tumor types."
"Soft tissue sarcomas of the head and neck region represent a rare group of tumors of which a limited number of published individual- and institution-based experiences exist. METHODS: We performed an analysis of head and neck sarcoma patients identified from our institution between 1973 and 1999. Exclusion criteria included pediatric rhabdomyosarcomas, sarcomas of the neuromeningeal axis or non-head and neck primary disease sites, and bone sarcomas. All cases underwent pathologic re-review before statistical analysis. RESULTS: After pathologic review, 111 head and neck sarcoma patients remained (mean age, 47 +/- 20 years). The median duration of follow-up was 51 months; the actuarial 5-year relapse-free, disease-specific, and overall survivals were 55%, 52%, and 44%, respectively. Forty-six percent remained free of recurrence at the most recent follow-up, and the most common site of recurrence was local followed by distant sites. By multivariate analysis, size and grade significantly influenced relapse-free, disease-specific, and overall survivals, whereas margin status additionally influenced relapse-free survival. Subset analysis of the fibrosarcoma/malignant fibrous histiocytoma and desmoid/dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans histologies was undertaken. CONCLUSIONS: Size >5 cm and high-grade histology are considered poor prognostic indicators. Patients with either of these characteristics should be considered for adjuvant trials."
"The main treatment of extra-abdominal desmoid tumors remains surgery, but recurrence rates up to 80% are reported. The impact of microscopic surgical margin status according to the Enneking classification system is discussed controversially. METHODS: Therefore, the authors screened the published literature for reliable data on the importance of a wide or radical excision of extra-abdominal desmoid tumors. All studies with more than ten patients, a surgical treatment only, and margin status stated were included. RESULTS: Only 12 out of 49 identified studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. One hundred fifty-two primary tumors were excised with wide or radical microscopic surgical margins, while in 260 cases a marginal or intralesional excision was performed. In the first group 41 patients (27%) and in the second one 187 patients (72%) developed a recurrence. Therefore, microscopic surgical margin status according to the Enneking classification system is a significant prognostic factor (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The data of this review underline the strategy of a wide or radical local excision as the treatment of choice. Furthermore, as a large number of studies had to be excluded from this analysis, exact microscopic surgical margin status should be provided in future studies in order to allow comparability. ."
"Groin soft tissue tumors are associated with high local recurrence rates of 16-48% and postoperative complications in 40-68%. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation and aggressive reconstructive techniques were utilized to improve local control and complication rates in this challenging area. METHODS: Nine patients in this prospective series were treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation (30 mg IV doxorubicin x 3d followed by 300 cGy/d x 10d) followed by surgery and two patients received radiation (5,000 cGy with tissue spacer) followed by surgery for tumors with a pelvic/retroperitoneal component. Surgery included resection plus reconstruction of the abdominal wall, myocutaneous flaps for large defects, and vascular reconstruction as necessary. RESULTS: The 11 consecutive patients presented with Stage I (30%), II (40%), or III (30%) disease. Four patients (36%) were operated on for possible incarcerated hernia prior to referral and two (18%) presented with recurrent tumors. Pathology included 10 sarcomas and 1 desmoid tumor; tumor grade was low (30%), moderate (40%), or high (30%). Local control (mean follow-up 55 months; minimum follow-up 36 months) and limb salvage rate was 100%. Minor wound complications not requiring re-operation occurred in three patients, lymphedema in two, and there were no postoperative hernias. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative therapy provides excellent local control of groin soft tissue tumors. Current surgical techniques allow extensive resection with limb salvage, dependable primary wound healing and long-term integrity of the abdominal wall."
"We performed a retrospective analysis of 35 cases of desmoid tumours (aggressive fibromatoses) that underwent treatment at our institutions between 1987 and 2002. The purpose was to evaluate the rate of local recurrence of desmoid tumours treated with surgical excision, to assess the impact of surgical margins on local recurrence and to define the role of radiotherapy in the treatment. Nine patients experienced a recurrence at an average of 16 months after initial treatment. Seven of the 15 patients with a less-than-wide margin had a local recurrence. Comparatively, only two of the 20 patients with a wide margin had a local recurrence. Thirty-three of the 35 patients were disease free at the last follow-up. We recommend wide excision with clear margins whenever possible. Marginal resections are appropriate when wide excision would severely compromise the function of the limb. Surgical resections and selective supplementation of adjuvant radiotherapy give excellent control rates."
"Soft tissue and bone sarcomas in the head and neck are rare tumors. The 1000 to 1500 yearly cases in the United States are distributed among at least 10 main histologies and multiple head and neck subsites. Although this makes structured studies difficult to perform and high-level evidence-based treatment algorithms difficult to find, basic treatment recommendations can be made from the existing literature for most histologies and subsites. This paper discusses the epidemiology, natural history, and treatment approaches for several of the most common head and neck sarcomas, including the ""adult soft tissue sarcomas,"" osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma of the larynx, angiosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, desmoid tumors, and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans."

"Aggressive fibromatosis is an uncommon tumor that is locally aggressive but not malignant. Therefore, its classification falls between the benign and malignant neoplasms of soft-tissue origin. In the past, these lesions were misdiagnosed as low-grade fibrosarcomas. Otolaryngologists should be familiar with these lesions because as many as 15% of them occur in the head and neck. The treatment of choice is wide surgical excision, which is often difficult. Postexcision recurrence rates are high. Nonsurgical treatment includes radiation and chemotherapy, both of which are usually reserved for recurrences. We describe two cases of aggressive fibromatosis of the parapharyngeal space, and we review the available treatment options."
"Despite their classification as benign, desmoid tumours are difficult to diagnose and manage. They are prone to recurrence and resection can be debilitating. Rarely, synchronous or metachronous multicentric desmoid tumours occur and may require further excision. Therefore, early detection of recurrence and multicentric tumours is vital. We present a case of metachronous desmoid tumours, and review the literature to propose a treatment pathway."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a rarely seen soft tissue tumor. They originate principally from deep seated fascial or musculoaponeurotic structures. Although they are considered histologically benign, they behave locally aggressive. Posterior mediastinal localisation is very rare. The patient who was investigated because of a lesion located in posterior mediastinum and a thoracal magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass with a dimension of 20 x 6 x 5 cm, started at the level of thoracal fourth vertebra reaching the L1 vertebra, was diagnosed as aggressive fibromatosis by a biopsy obtained after a right posterior thoracotomy performed by thoracic surgery. A minimal regression was established nine months after radiotherapy by thoracal MRI. This case of aggressive fibromatosis, which was asymptomatic and whose posterior mediastinal mass did not increased its dimensions during six years of follow-up, was presented."
"Details on second neoplasms (SNs) following pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors are scant, because of the rarity of such SNs. The goal of the current study was to investigate and characterize these rare SNs. METHODS: The authors reviewed clinical and treatment data on all institutional patients age < 22 years at diagnosis of a primary CNS tumor who developed any type of SN. Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 were excluded. Cumulative incidence rates were estimated, and putative risk factors were analyzed. RESULTS: The SNs investigated in the current study included 10 gliomas (42%), 5 meningiomas (21%), 2 desmoid tumors, 2 myelodysplastic syndromes, 2 basal cell carcinomas, 1 leukemia, 1 malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and 1 thyroid carcinoma. Twenty-one patients had previously received radiotherapy, and 12 patients had received chemotherapy. The SN was related to a genetic cause in 7 patients (29%). Eleven patients died of their SNs, including 8 patients with glioma and 2 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. The estimated 15-year cumulative incidence rate for malignant SNs was 4%. Children with choroid plexus tumors had an estimated 10-year cumulative incidence rate of 20.2%; 2 of those patients had germline TP53 mutations. Age </= 2 years was a significant risk factor (P = 0.016) for development of an SN only when patients with genetic conditions were included in the analysis. No significant difference in the estimated cumulative incidence of SNs was found among patients who had received different types of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of lethal SNs after pediatric CNS tumors is small. Young patients and patients with choroid plexus tumors appear to have an increased risk of SNs that is associated with genetic factors."
"There has been no report on useful immunohistological markers for epithelioid sarcoma (ES) so far. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the positivity and specificity of CA125 as a marker for the correct diagnosis of ES. METHODS: This study was performed in 11 patients with ES (nine men and two women; distal type: 10 cases; proximal type: one case), 78 patients with other soft tissue tumors and nine with benign granulomas. The other soft tissue tumors consisted of six synovial sarcomas, six clear cell sarcomas, eight leiomyosarcomas, six rhabdomyosarcomas, five malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, ten malignant fibrous histiocytomas, 17 desmoid tumors, 14 liposarcomas, six squamous cell carcinomas (cutaneous SCC of the distal extremities), two rheumatoid nodules and seven foreign body granulomas. Immunohistochemical analysis for CA125 was performed for these 89 soft tissue tumors and nine granulomas using a labeled streptavidin biotin method. Immunohistochemical analysis of epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin, carcinoembrionic antigen, vimentin and CD34 was performed only for the 11 ES patients. RESULTS: CA125 was strongly expressed in 10 out of the 11 ES patients. EMA, cytokeratin and vimentin were also positive in all the cases. CEA was positive in two of the 11 patients. Immunohistochemical study in six ES patients showed expression of CD 34. The other 78 soft tissue tumors and nine granulomas did not express CA125. CONCLUSION: This study clearly revealed the specificity and positivity of CA125 in ES. These data indicate that CA125 may be a useful tumor marker for diagnosing ES."
"Restorative proctocolectomy (RPC) eliminates the risk of colorectal adenocarcinoma in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients, but desmoid tumors, duodenal, and ileal adenomas can still develop. Our aim was to assess the long-term outcome of FAP patients after RPC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: FAP patients who had RPC between 1983 and 1990 were contacted for interview and upper gastrointestinal (GI) and ileal pouch endoscopy. RESULTS: Sixty-two males and 48 females had undergone hand-sewn RPC during this period. One patient died postoperatively (0.9%). Among 96 patients available for a minimal follow-up of 11 years, 7 patients died: 3 from causes unrelated to FAP, 2 from metastatic colorectal cancer, and 2 from mesenteric desmoid tumor (MDT). Thirteen patients had a symptomatic MDT (13.5%). Of 73 patients who had an upper GI endoscopy, 52 developed duodenal and/or ampullary adenomas. Four patients required surgical treatment of their duodenal lesions. Among 54 patients who underwent ileal pouch endoscopy, pouch adenomas were noted in 29. No invasive duodenal or ileal pouch carcinoma were detected. Functional results of RPC were significantly worse in MDT patients. CONCLUSIONS: RPC eliminates the risk of colorectal cancer, and close upper GI surveillance may help prevent duodenal malignancy. MDTs are the principal cause of death, once colorectal cancer has been prevented, and the main reason for worsening functional results."
"Spindle cell lesions of the breast constitute a wide spectrum of benign and malignant proliferations. Myofibroblasts, normal cellular constituents of the mammary intra- and interlobular stroma, compose many of these lesions, which include reactive proliferations and benign or locally aggressive neoplasms. Because of its morphology, low-grade metaplastic spindle cell carcinoma, ""fibromatosis-like"" is also considered together with spindle cell lesions of the breast. Although certain of the lesions do not occur commonly, they represent diagnostic challenges. This review outlines the morphology of certain spindle cell lesions of the breast including pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia, reactive spindle cell nodule, nodular fasciitis, myofibroblastoma, primary mammary fibromatosis, and low-grade metaplastic spindle cell carcinoma, ""fibromatosis-like."" The differential diagnosis and diagnostic work-up of these lesions is discussed, and their clinical treatment and prognosis briefly summarized."
"Intraabdominal fibromatosis is an uncommon neoplasm. The aggressive nature of these tumors and the potential for major morbidity secondary to resection can present a difficult surgical dilemma. A 9-year-old boy presented with anemia and vomiting. He had esophagogastric fibromatosis diagnosed and underwent distal esophagectomy, total gastrectomy, Hunt-Lawrence jejunal pouch, and Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy. This report describes the successful surgical management of an esophagogastric fibromatosis for the first time in the English-language literature. The management of this tumor is discussed with particular regard to the very unusual clinical presentation."
"The optimum management and long-term outcome for patients with extremity desmoids remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of patients with extremity desmoids and to compare patient episodes treated with surgery alone with those treated by radiotherapy either alone or with surgery at any stage of the patient's disease. METHODS: All patients with extremity desmoids followed at an oncology clinic with an interest in soft tissue tumours and treated between 1959 and 1996 were identified. All were traced back to their primary presentation and first treatment episode. RESULTS: During the study period 42 patients, 29 females and 13 males were identified. Median follow-up of the patient population was 12.5 years (range 3-30.9). Median age at presentation was 27 years (range 1-69). The lesion was in the upper limb or shoulder in 18, lower limp or pelvis 17 and head and neck 7. Forty patients underwent operation as their primary treatment, 25 of whom developed recurrent tumour. In all there were 41 recurrences following 78 episodes of surgery alone. This compared to 10 recurrences following 16 episodes of radiotherapy or radiotherapy with surgery (p = 0.467). There was no association between primary, first or second recurrence and the development of a further relapse. The median interval to recurrence after surgery alone was 12 months (interquartile range (IQR) 6-13) as opposed to 52 months (IQR 33-62) for patients treated with primary or adjuvant radiotherapy (p= 0.004). CONCLUSION: Results are poor after both radiotherapy and surgery for extremity desmoids and research into other methods of managing this rare condition need to be considered."
"Desmoids (fibromatosis agressiva) are rare neoplasms of soft tissues. The most common localization of these lesions are limbs, retroperitoneal space, wall of abdomen and chest cavities. The aim of this study is to report two cases of fibromatosis agressiva extraabdominalis and review some facts concern with symptoms, investigation and treatment of this disease."
"Desmoid tumours are locally invasive soft tissue tumours in which beta-catenin mediated TCF-dependent transcription is activated. The role of soluble factors secreted by the myofibroblastic desmoid tumour, which could stimulate tumour invasiveness, was investigated. Using collagen gel invasion assays, the presence of factors stimulating invasion in desmoid conditioned media (CM) could be established. Since matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in the process of tumoral invasion, the expression levels of the MMP family members were evaluated. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was used to determine the expression levels of MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP7, MMP11, MMP12, MMP13, MMP14 and the inhibitors TIMP1, TIMP2 and TIMP3. Besides overexpression of MMP7, a known TCF-dependent target gene, a striking upregulation of the expression levels of MMP1, MMP3, MMP11, MMP12 and MMP13 in desmoid tumours, compared to unaffected fibroblasts from the same patients, was found. Treating the CM of desmoids with a synthetic and a physiologic MMP inhibitor reduced the invasion-stimulating capacity of the desmoid CM by approximately 50%. These results suggest the involvement of soluble factors, released by the desmoid cells, in stimulating invasion and implicate the MMPs as facilitators of invasion."

"The purpose of this report was to describe the first known case of ileoanal pouch salvage by a low-dose regimen of vinblastine and methotrexate chemotherapy for the treatment of desmoid tumor arising from the mesentery of the ileoanal pouch in a patient who had undergone ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for familial adenomatous polyposis. Mesenteric desmoid tumor involving the ileoanal pouch in a 28-year-old female was treated with vinblastine and methotrexate biweekly for 12 months and monthly for 12 months in an outpatient unit. The desmoid tumor response to the treatment was assessed at routine intervals by physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging. Desmoid tumor was successfully treated with a low-dose regimen of vinblastine and methotrexate chemotherapy without significant side effects, and function of the ileoanal pouch was fully preserved. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a decrease in desmoid tumor size and cellularity, and changes consistent with fibrosis. This is a unique case highlighting the possibility of ileoanal pouch salvage by low-dose combination chemotherapy using vinblastine and methotrexate in a familial adenomatous polyposis patient with mesenteric desmoid tumor."
"The purpose of this study was to examine the health-related quality of life in a sample of Canadian adults diagnosed with familial adenomatous polyposis and desmoid tumor. METHODS: The study was conducted in two parts. Seven individuals participated in a focus group prior to a mail-out survey. A cross-sectional mail-out survey was administered to eligible individuals who were actively followed at the Familial Gastrointestinal Cancer Registry at Mount Sinai Hospital. RESULTS: Forty-one individuals (25 female and 16 male) were available to be contacted by the registry coordinator and 23 questionnaire packages were completed, resulting in a 56.1 percent participation rate. The results of this study demonstrated a reduced health-related quality of life for individuals living with familial adenomatous polyposis and desmoid tumor for over 10 years. The main predictors of health-related quality of life in this analysis included marital status (married vs. not married), prior knowledge of desmoid tumor in the family, and current level of hopelessness (R(2) = 0.856, df = 13, F = 26.8, P < 0.001). The qualitative content analysis of themes from the focus group indicated that ongoing medical uncertainty and lack of information from health care professionals, isolation, and family communication were the main challenges in living with desmoid tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study suggest that ongoing education of health care professionals is warranted and that information and support interventions may be beneficial to this clinical population."
"The desmoid tumor (DT) is a soft tissue neoplasm most frequently localized in the anterior abdominal wall typically in females of childbearing age. Because its particular incidence in women who had recently been pregnant, it was correlated with delivery's trauma stimulating proliferation of muscolo-aponeurotic tissues. Complete surgical resection is the recommended treatment approach to prevent recurrence. Many authors emphasize the role of radiotherapy in regression of DT and in controlling local recurrence in patient who had incomplete resection. Many others emphasize the role of chemotherapy or antiestrogenic compounds, even though tumour does not express estrogen receptors. DT, otherwise, is neoplasm with high rates of recurrence after surgery but it never develops distant metastases, so that function and structure-sparing surgery may be a reasonable choice in young women when possible without leaving macroscopic residual disease. Furthermore literature data suggest that the presence of incomplete histological surgical resection does not correlate with local recurrence and that pregnancy does not represent a risk factor. In women of childbearing age, even after non radical histological DT primary resection, adjunctive radiotherapy, chemotherapy or antiestrogen therapy could be avoided and clinical observation alone may be considered."
"Morbus Ledderhose is a rare fibromatous disease of the plantar fascia. Clinical features include palpable solitary or multiple nodules and cords, mainly affecting the medial part of the plantar fascia. When clinical symptoms occur, conservative options include stretching, orthotics, nonsteroidal antirheumatic drugs, local cortisone-injections and physiotherapy. Operative treatment is indicated in case of persistent pain or if conservative measures fail. The standard procedure includes a partial fasciectomy of the plantar aponeurosis. There is a high recurrence rate with an increased risk of complications and more aggressive ingrowth into anatomical structures after partial resection. Therefore we recommend a complete fasciectomy not only in recurrent disease, but also as the primary procedure of choice."
"Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) have a cumulative lifetime risk of over 90% for developing duodenal adenomas, which are the precursor lesions for duodenal adenocarcinoma. Consequently, these patients have a 5% to 10% lifetime risk of periampullary or duodenal adenocarcinoma, making this the leading cause of cancer death in FAP patients who have had prophylactic colectomies. The increased relative risk of duodenal carcinoma in FAP patients and the poor outcomes associated with the treatment of advanced duodenal cancer have led to the development of prevention strategies for this cancer in the setting of FAP. It is generally accepted that surveillance for duodenal adenomas and adenocarcinomas should be included in the management of patients with FAP, although there are few data from clinical trials that demonstrate the effectiveness of surveillance strategies or chemoprevention for the prevention of death from duodenal cancer. Prospective case series have shown that endoscopic surveillance with endoscopic or surgical treatment of high-risk lesions in the duodenal or periampullary region can be performed with successful removal of the at-risk lesion(s). Surveillance should begin at about 21 years of age and should be performed using both an end-viewing and a side-viewing upper endoscope. An interval of 3 to 5 years between examinations appears to be adequate if no polyposis is evident. Once polyposis develops, an interval of 1 to 3 years between screenings for mild polyposis is appropriate. Patients with denser polyposis or larger adenomas are recommended to undergo examination every 6 to 12 months because of their increased risk of developing duodenal adenocarcinoma. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy with sulindac, a nonselective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, or celecoxib, a COX-2 selective inhibitor, may be of benefit after the development of duodenal polyposis by inducing the regression or stabilization of the polyposis, although there is limited evidence from randomized, controlled trials to support its routine use. Almost all cases of adenocarcinoma occur in patients with advanced polyposis (Spigelman stage IV disease), and approximately 33% of this group will go on to develop adenocarcinoma if left untreated. The most definitive procedure for reducing the risk of adenocarcinoma is surgical resection of the ampulla and/or duodenum. Pancreaticoduodenectomy or pancreas-sparing duodenectomy are appropriate surgical therapies that are believed to substantially reduce the risk of developing periampullary adenocarcinoma. However, these procedures are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, including the risk of inducing desmoid tumor formation in FAP patients."
"Desmoids are rare mesenchimal tumors that may originate also inside the abdomen or in the abdominal wall. These tumors are biologically characterized by a tendency to local growth, and only rarely are they able to develop distant metastases. Surgical excision usually is the best treatment with a chance of a cure. In the few reports on intraabdominal or abdominal wall desmoids, open surgery always was performed. The first case of successful laparoscopic resection of a symptomatic anterior wall desmoid tumor with intraabdominal growth is reported. During the procedure, it was difficult to mobilize and grasp the mass using the common laparoscopic instruments, but with the help of the ""marionette trick,"" modified suture traction technique, the tumor could be removed easily using only three trocars. With four traction sutures minimizing the wall trauma, the trick made it possible to mobilize the mass in at least, seven directions, according to the principles of physical forces and vectors. This simple trick can be helpful for other common laparoscopic procedures, avoiding the insertion of sometimes ineffective instruments through more traumatic trocars."
"Aggressive fibromatosis represents a group of tumors with heterogeneous patterns of biologic behavior. In this study, gene expression in 12 samples of aggressive fibromatosis, as well as that in samples of normal skeletal muscle and a variety of normal tissues, was determined at Gene Logic Inc (Gaithersburg, MD), with the use of Affymetrix GeneChip U_133 arrays containing approximately 33,000 genes. Gene-expression analysis was performed with the Gene Logic Gene Express software system. Differences in gene expression were quantified as the fold change in gene expression between the sets of fibromatosis tissue and normal skeletal muscle. A set of genes was then identified that was significantly overexpressed in aggressive fibromatosis compared with expression in normal muscle. This set of genes was then further examined for expression in a variety of normal tissues. We identified genes that were selectively overexpressed in aggressive fibromatosis compared with expression in 448 samples comprising 16 different nonneoplastic tissues. In particular, ADAM12, WISP-1, SOX-11, and fibroblast activation protein-alpha were uniquely overexpressed in aggressive fibromatosis compared with expression in normal tissues. In addition, the technique of Eisen clustering identified 2 distinct subgroups of aggressive fibromatosis with regard to gene expression. We conclude that gene-expression patterns may be useful in the further classification of subtypes of aggressive fibromatosis and that such classification could have clinical significance."

"Familial adenomatous polyposis is a hereditary disease with autossomic and dominant features, frequently associated to many extracolonic manifestations. AIM: To report extracolonic manifestations incidence and to analyze its impact on the disease's outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Revision of patient charts treated from 1977 to 2001, relating associated extracolonic manifestations and its complications. RESULTS: Among 59 familial adenomatous polyposis patients, 23 (38,9%) presented some extracolonic manifestations at diagnosis or during follow-up. There were registered 37 different extracolonic manifestations (1.6 per patient). The most common manifestations were osteomas and congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium, diagnosed in 25% and 20% of the investigated patients, respectively. Other extracolonic manifestations were represented by upper digestive adenomas, epidermoid cysts, desmoid tumor (seven each), gastric cancer (three) and tireoid cancer (two). Desmoid-associated complications were reported in six patients, being intestinal obstruction in four and hidronephrosis in two; two deaths (28,5%) were registered. CONCLUSIONS: Extracolonic manifestations incidence is high (40%) and may affect disease's outcome and patient's quality of life. For these reasons, the research, prevention and adequate treatment of extracolonic manifestations turn into vital importance in familial adenomatous polyposis patients."
"In the peritoneal cavity, diffuse serosal replacement by tumor is demonstrated usually by extensive carcinomatous involvement from gastric, colonic, or pancreatic tumors or less frequently by mesothelioma. Primary tumors other than mesothelioma are extremely rare in the peritoneum. The computed tomographic appearances of two cases of rare peritoneal tumors, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma and desmoplastic small round cell tumor, are described."
"Desmoid tumors are mesenchymal nonmetastasizing neoplasms. Although rare in the general population, they are a common extracolonic manifestation of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Because of high tumor recurrence rates, surgery has been less than satisfactory in the treatment of desmoid tumors. In the current study, high doses of tamoxifen in combination with sulindac were used to treat severe desmoid tumors to avoid surgery. METHODS: Since 1992, 25 patients at Heinrich Heine University (Dusseldorf, Germany) were treated with a combination of tamoxifen and sulindac. In the current study, 17 patients with FAP-associated and 8 patients with sporadic desmoid tumors received 120 mg of tamoxifen and 300 mg of sulindac daily. Every 6 months, the protracted course of desmoid growth was measured by computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging scans. Tumor responses were characterized as progressive disease, stable disease (SD), partial regression (PR), and complete regression (CR). RESULTS: Of the group of patients who received tamoxifen and sulindac as a primary treatment, all three patients with sporadic desmoid tumors demonstrated cessation of growth, and 10 of the 13 patients with FAP-associated tumors achieved either a PR or CR. In the sporadic desmoid tumor group, eight of nine patients developed tumor recurrences after undergoing surgery at other institutions. Of these, two patients had SD and two patients had a PR to CR. CONCLUSIONS: The patients with desmoid tumors who were managed conservatively with high-dose tamoxifen and sulindac had the best outcome. Desmoid tumor recurrence after surgery was high and in the FAP-associated tumor group, therapy with tamoxifen and sulindac was found to be less successful. Based on this experience, the authors recommended high-dose tamoxifen and sulindac as the primary treatment for patients with FAP-associated desmoid tumors. However, to our knowledge, the best approach after surgical intervention for patients with sporadic desmoid tumors remains to be determined."
"Desmoid tumors (aggressive fibromatosis) are locally invasive soft tissue tumors in which beta-catenin-mediated TCF-3-dependent transcription is activated. To provide more insight into the pathophysiology of these tumors, expression profiles were generated using oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix). In total, 69 differentially expressed genes were identified in desmoids compared to normal fibroblasts (fascia) from the same patients. The differential expression of a selection of genes was confirmed using RT-PCR and Northern blotting. We further evaluated the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 6 (IGFBP-6), a gene that was consistently downregulated in all desmoids tested. Promotor studies and electromobility shift assays revealed two functional beta-catenin/TCF-responsive elements in the human IGFBP-6 promoter. These findings suggest that IGFBP-6 is directly downregulated by the beta-catenin/TCF complex in desmoid tumors, and imply a role for the IGF axis in the proliferation of desmoid tumors."

"Desmoid tumors are uncommon, benign, fibrous lesions occurring sporadically and in association with familial adenomatous polyposis. Typical clinical features include a locally aggressive behavior, an unpredictable course, and a high propensity for recurrence after surgical resection. There are no standard medical or surgical approaches, and no markers for monitoring medical therapy of desmoid tumors. METHODS: We report two cases of mesenteric desmoid tumors treated with interferon alfa-2b and toremifene, a novel regimen devised to block angiogenesis. Pre- and posttreatment desmoid tumor tissues were obtained in one patient during a repeat resection for recurrent stenosing Crohn's disease and examined for mean vessel count and cellular proliferation levels by immunostaining for the endothelial surface antigen CD31 and the proliferation associated nuclear antigen, Ki-67, respectively. We assessed plasma D-dimers, a potential marker of angiogenic activity, and followed this throughout the course of antiangiogenic therapy in our two patients. RESULTS: Examination of posttreatment tissue revealed a significant decrease in microvessel density (P<0.02) and Ki-67-positive nuclei (P<0.0001) compared with pretreatment tissue. Both patients demonstrated a prompt and sustained drop in previously elevated plasma D-dimer levels, which correlated clinically with lesion regression and sustained remission. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with toremifene and interferon alfa-2b was successful and well tolerated in our two patients. Our data suggest a combined antiangiogenic and antiproliferative mechanism of action. Furthermore, normalization of previously elevated plasma D-dimers may emerge as a strategy to monitor treatment efficacy in mesenteric desmoid tumors."
"We report the case of a 20-year-old woman with a desmoid fibroma of the finger, which is an extremely rare location. Desmoid fibromas are benign but very infiltrative tumors, known for their frequent recurrences. Because of the many vascular and nervous structures concentrated in the finger, complete surgical excision is difficult."

"Clear cell carcinoma arising in a cesarean section scar is an extremely rare disease. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published report on the aspiration cytology. CASE: A 56-year-old woman presented with a mass in a cesarean section scar. Initially an abdominal desmoid was considered, but the features of fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology suggested an adenocarcinoma. The resected tumor was histologically composed of clear cell carcinoma showing cystic, solid and papillary patterns. CONCLUSION: FNA cytology of masses arising in a surgical scar can be a useful tool in obtaining an accurate pathologic diagnosis of a malignant neoplasm."

"Patients with established or irreversible plantar sensory loss often have normal sensation on the dorsal aspect of the foot, due to an intact deep peroneal nerve. A new method of deep peroneal nerve transfer is proposed for repair of plantar sensory loss caused by extensive nerve gaps or high-level lesions of the posterior tibial nerve. Two cases in which this technique was used are described. The surgical technique is relatively easy, with a short operating time, rapid nerve regeneration after surgery, accurate sensory recovery, and minimal donor-site morbidity with sensory loss only on the first web space of the foot."

"Sclerosing mesenteritis is a complex inflammatory disorder of the mesentery. Although sclerosing mesenteritis is often associated with other idiopathic inflammatory disorders such as retroperitoneal fibrosis, sclerosing cholangitis, Riedel thyroiditis, and orbital pseudotumor, its exact cause is unknown. The computed tomographic (CT) appearance of sclerosing mesenteritis will vary depending on the predominant tissue component (fat, inflammation, or fibrosis). CT plays an important role in suggesting the diagnosis in the proper clinical setting and can be useful in distinguishing sclerosing mesenteritis from other mesenteric diseases with similar CT features such as carcinomatosis, carcinoid tumor, lymphoma, desmoid tumor, and mesenteric edema. Nevertheless, surgical biopsy and pathologic analysis are usually necessary to make the diagnosis. Treatment may consist of therapy with steroids, colchicine, immunosuppressive agents, or orally administered progesterone. Surgical resection is sometimes attempted for definitive therapy, although the surgical approach is often limited by vascular involvement. CT with three-dimensional volume rendering is optimal for accurate, noninvasive follow-up of sclerosing mesenteritis and of any potential complications."
"The aim of our paper is to assess the functional results and specific difficulties encountered in the treatment of desmoid tumors located near the brachial plexus. Seven patients with a desmoid tumor in this region were followed for at least 2 years (average 59 months). All patients were managed operatively. The resection was marginal in 6 patients and intralesional in one. Three patient had postoperatively chemotherapy and 1 patient had radiation therapy. At review, none of the 7 patients had had to undergo upper limb amputation and the mean functional results were good or excellent in 6 patients (mean MSTS = 72.8). The margins of desmoid tumor resection have to be wide to avoid local recurrence. However, nerves and blood vessels have to be preserved in order to maintain upper limb function and there may well be a need for adjuvant therapy."
"Among the great variety of extracolonic manifestations of familial adenomatous polyposis, the most serious are desmoids and fibromatosis of the abdominal cavity. These may be a danger to the patient and a concern to the clinician. Pharmacological management of this relentless problem is favored by surgical intervention. At present, however, beneficial actions of medical therapy are not separable from undesirable side effects. METHODS: We studied the effects of 120 mg daily of raloxifene, a non-steroidal benzothiophene, on progressive desmoid tumors and mesenteric fibromatosis by evaluation of lesion size and symptoms in 13 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, selected on the basis of intra-abdominal localization of the lesion, on refractoriness to other medical treatments, and on estrogen receptor-alpha expression. RESULTS: The patients had a significant response to raloxifene therapy, with complete remission in 8 cases and partial response in 5 cases, evaluated by regression of symptoms and tumor size. Serum biochemical parameters did not show any significant changes. Side effects were never observed. CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of patients included in the study is limited and in spite of some limitations, the available results support that, in the evaluation of response, daily therapy with raloxifene decreases desmoid tumor and mesenteric fibromatosis size and symptoms and does not cause side effects. These findings offer a novel option in the pharmacological treatment of desmoids, leading to medical therapy of these neoplastic lesions in familial adenomatous polyposis patients."
"Tissue biopsy alone is diagnostic in less than 10% of cases of metastatic bone disease with an unknown primary tumor. Accordingly, to delineate the neoplastic process in cases of metastatic bone disease, where the primary tumor cannot be determined with conventional modalities, new tools are attractive. Complementary deoxyribonucleic acid cDNA microarrays may be such a tool. Verification and validation of this technology for analysis of specimens ex vivo is mandatory if it is to be used to analyze the complexity of heterogenous biologic tissues. To convey the issues involved in the clinical application of cDNA microarray analysis of tumor specimens ex vivo, a set of experiments analyzing surgically resected human specimens is presented. The specific aims of the analysis were to assess cDNA microarray reproducibility of serial tissue preparations of tumor samples and to confirm that heterogeneity within a given clinical tumor specimen does not preclude this technique as a tool to discern tumor types. Complementary deoxyribonucleic microarray analysis, as it applies to heterogeneous clinical tumor samples in limited numbers, based on preliminary data, seems to be an appropriate but still experimental method for distinguishing tumor types."

"Resection of lesions of the root of the mesentery with established techniques is difficult and at times impossible because of their proximity to the blood supply of the intestine. Damage of the superior mesenteric vessels necessitates resection of the intestine, resulting in short bowel syndrome and intestinal failure. STUDY DESIGN: We describe a surgical technique drawn from our experience in intestinal transplantation in which the root of the mesentery (including the lesion) and the head or the entire pancreas, duodenum, small intestine, and part of the colon are excised en bloc and preserved in a cold solution. Resection of the lesion is performed in a bloodless field ex vivo, and the salvaged intestine is reimplanted in the abdominal cavity. We performed this procedure in four patients, two adult and two pediatric, who had extensive neoplasms of the root of the mesentery. Their underlying diseases were mesenteric fibroma, vascular dysplasia of the root of the mesentery, pancreatic cancer, and desmoid tumor. RESULTS: Local control of the lesions was achieved in all four cases, preserving at the same time enough small intestine to avoid short bowel syndrome. All patients survived the operation and live on enteral nutrition 6 to 49.5 months after the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: The procedure of partial abdominal exenteration, ex vivo resection, and autotransplantation is an extension of our experience with intestinal transplantation. In selected cases, this technique may be useful in the treatment of extensive, otherwise unresectable lesions of the root of the mesentery."
Patients with an extraabdominal desmoid tumor have multiple minor bone abnormalities. The authors describe a rare case of an extraabdominal desmoid tumor that developed in a scar 2 years after surgery for Sprengel's deformity of the right shoulder in an 8-year-old girl. The association between the tumor and Sprengel's deformity has never been reported previously. Antecedent surgical trauma might play a role in the development of this tumor.
"The incidence of thyroid carcinoma in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is thought to be 1%-2%, with the majority of cases being female. We have investigated the phenotype and genotype of 16 patients with FAP associated thyroid carcinoma. Among 1194 FAP patients studied in two high risk registries in North America (Familial Gastrointestinal Cancer Registry, Toronto and University California, San Francisco), 16 (1.3%) unrelated patients with FAP associated thyroid cancers were identified. Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene testing was performed in 14 of the 16 cases. The average age of diagnosis for FAP and thyroid carcinoma was 29 years (range 17-52 years) and 33 years (range 17-55 years), respectively. All FAP patients except 1 had more than 100 colonic adenomas. Extracolonic manifestations, beside thyroid cancer, were presented in 81% (n = 13) of the patients, including gastric and duodenal polyps, desmoid tumor, osteoma, epidermoid cyst, sebaceous cyst and lipoma. Colorectal cancer was diagnosed in 38% (n = 6) of the patients. The pathology of the FAP associated thyroid cancer was predominantly papillary carcinoma. Germline mutations were identified in 12 of 14 patients tested. Mutations proximal to the mutation cluster region (1286-1513) were detected in 9 cases. Thyroid cancer in our FAP population was rare, predominantly in females and showed papillary carcinoma histology. Additionally, thyroid cancer in our patients occurred in the setting of classic FAP phenotype. Germline mutations were located predominantly outside the APC mutation cluster region."
"1) to evaluate if recent progresses (knowledge of natural history, genetic diagnosis and surgical treatment) have an impact upon the long term follow up of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP); 2) to assess the prognosis factors that are relative to recent progresses in diagnosis and treatment procedures. A retrospective study of 51 cases was carried out in July 2002 to analyse the following characteristics: phenotype, treatment, operative mortality and morbidity, late complications, especially rectal stump cancer after ileo-rectal anastomosis, duodenal adenomatosis and desmoid tumors. Twenty seven men and 24 women underwent surgery: 11 colo-rectal cancers were present at first step. Initial surgical procedures included 39 total colectomies with ileo-rectal anastomosis (IRA), 6 coloproctectomies with ileo-anal anastomosis (IAA) and 6 coloproctectomies with permanent ileostomy. Operative mortality was nil. Operative morbidity affected 11 patients. The rectum had to be secondary removed in 11 patients with convert in IAA. Duodenal adenomatosis required surgery in 10 patients: 5 surgical local excisions, 4 duodenopancreatectomies and 1 palliative by-pass. Six desmoid tumors were noted during the follow-up. On the whole 3 patients were lost of sight. Nine patients died (19.1%), 4 deaths were in relation with the disease: 1 rectal cancer, 2 duodenal cancers, 1 desmoid tumor necrosis. At the end of the follow up (mean duration: 17 years) 26 IRA and 17 IAA are present with good functional results. This study, according to already published data, suggests that today the risk of death related to colorectal cancer is becoming lower than the risk of death from duodenal cancer and desmoid tumor evolution, particularly since the introduction of the restorative proctocolectomy. The genetic diagnosis is useful in order to determine the choice of surgical procedures."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumor) is a locally invasive soft tissue neoplasm associated with mutations resulting in beta-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation. This tumor is composed of cells with histological and molecular characteristics common to proliferating mesenchymal cells of dermal wounds. Using immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR, we show that Rhamm, a protein with an important role in wound healing and neoplastic progression, is also expressed at high levels in aggressive fibromatosis. A mouse harboring a targeted deletion in Rhamm was generated, resulting in viable Rhamm-/- animals. Rhamm-/- mice were crossed with Apc/Apc1638N mice, which harbor a targeted mutation in the Apc gene predisposing animals to gastrointestinal and aggressive fibromatosis tumors. Rhamm deficiency significantly decreased the number of aggressive fibromatosis tumors formed, but did not alter the number of gastrointestinal polyps. Cell culture studies show that Rhamm regulates cell proliferation in both fibroblasts and fibromatosis cells under conditions of low density, but not high density. These results suggest that Rhamm regulates proliferation of cells with sparse cell-cell contacts, such as occurs in aggressive fibromatosis; provides the first genetic evidence implicating Rhamm in tumor pathology; and suggest Rhamm blockade as a potential therapeutic target for this otherwise difficult-to-treat neoplasm."
"We retrospectively studied the outcome in a consecutive series of 30 patients with desmoid tumors who were followed for more than 20 years after treatment (surgery in 29 patients). A local recurrence occurred in 12 patients and more than 1 recurrence occurred in 8. 3 patients had spontaneous complete regression of the tumor. At follow-up after mean 28 (20-54) years, all patients were tumor-free except 1 who had had a stable tumor for at least 11 years. Symptoms were related more to treatment than to the tumor. We conclude that desmoid tumors may have a high capacity for self-limitation and that conservative therapy should be considered in symptom-free patients."
"Desmoid tumors are benign neoplasms of the fibromatosis group. Data on their acquired chromosomal changes are sparse and, therefore, we wanted to ascertain what genomic losses and gains these tumors may have incurred. DNA was extracted from a total of 26 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded desmoid tumors followed by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) analyses. Ten of 12 informative tumors were normal by CGH; the two abnormal ones had loss of chromosome 6 and loss of 6q and gain of chromosome 20, respectively. I-FISH analyses with an alpha-satellite probe specific for chromosome 8 of 26 desmoids, including one tumor that by karyotyping had +i(8)(q10), showed no evident abnormalities. An explanation for the relatively high frequency of genomically normal tumors by CGH seen in this study may be sought in the fact that as many as 10 of the 12 informative tumors were abdominal desmoids, a subset of tumors also previously found to exhibit genomic changes only rarely. It is therefore possible that abdominal desmoids might be non-neoplastic tumors or neoplastic tumors with genetic changes too small to be discovered by CGH, whereas desmoid tumors from other locations exhibit detectable genomic changes at a significantly higher frequency."
"The purpose of this study was to report the clinical course and outcome in 12 patients with extra-abdominal desmoid tumors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective series included 12 patients with extra-abdominal desmoid tumors treated between 1987 and 1996. Female gender predominated (8/12) and age ranged from 4 months to 60 years. The tumors were identified in the thoracic wall (n=2), the upper limb (n=4), and the lower limb (n=6) with a bony localization in the upper femoral metaphysis. Magnetic resonance imaging was highly contributive to the search for extension. Surgical treatment was given in all cases. All patients were living at last follow-up. RESULTS: Complete resection was achieved in three patients and incomplete resection in nine. Mean follow-up was seven years. There was one case of sarcomatous transformation and nine cases of recurrence. Mean time to recurrence was one year (range 6 months-4 years). Two tumors, in the forearm and the leg, did not recur. Secondary surgery was not attempted in four patients whose clinical situation has remained stable after recurrence. A second resection was performed for recurrence in four other patients who then remained recurrence-free to last follow-up. One tumor recurred three times after surgical resection. Functional outcome was good in nine patients. DISCUSSION: The poorly limited nature of extra-abdominal desmoid tumors makes resection a difficult task, particularly when located in the girdles or the most proximal part of the limbs. Wide first-intention surgical resection is recommended but mutilation must be avoided due to the benign nature of the tumor, its slow progression, and the possibility of regression or stability after recurrence. Nevertheless, surgical treatment of recurrent tumors is difficult and often insufficient, compromising functional outcome. Complementary treatment (radiotherapy) has been advocated for better control tumor growth."
"Although there have been reports of desmoid tumors of the chest wall, pleural extension, as well as overall size greater than 20 cm, is rare. We present the case of a large desmoid tumor involving the left anterior chest wall, upper abdomen, and diaphragm, which impinged on the left lung and displaced the liver. Wide surgical excision, reconstruction, and differential diagnosis from fibrosarcoma are essential elements in the treatment of these rare tumors."
"In this paper a case of vast desmoid tumor of the abdominal wall associated with familial adenomatous polyposis is reported. Desmoid tumors represent a particular type of fibrous neoplasms with a higher prevalence in females. They are extremely rare in the sporadic form, while they are found in about 10% of patients affected by familial adenomatous polyposis. Despite their benign histology and the absence of metastatic potential, they can be considered as fibrosarcomas with a low level of malignancy because of their locally invasive nature. The treatment of choice is surgical excision, as wide as possible, aimed at preventing recurrences, which are frequent in this tumor type. The usefulness of complementary therapies such as radiotherapy, hormone or chemotherapy, is not entirely clear."
"Pirfenidone (Deskar, Marnac Inc., Dallas, TX), 5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-(1H)-pyridone, is a broad-spectrum, noncytotoxic, oral antifibrotic agent that is reported to inhibit or block the action of cytokine growth factors: transforming growth factor beta1, platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor, and to prevent formation of new fibrotic lesions. METHODS: We enrolled 10 women and four men with extensive familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)-associated desmoid disease in a 2-yr open-label treatment trial with oral pirfenidone. Imaging of desmoids was conducted at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months. RESULTS: No drug toxicity or drug intolerance was encountered. Seven patients dropped out (three because of progressive disease), and seven continued for at least 18 months. Of those that continued, two had partial but significant reduction in the size of all desmoids beginning in the first 6 months of treatment, and two others experienced relief of symptoms without change in desmoid size. Three patients experienced no change in tumor size or symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Pirfenidone is well tolerated by patients with FAP-associated desmoid tumors. Some patients with FAP/desmoid tumors treated with pirfenidone had regression of tumors, some had progression, and some had no response. Patients with rapidly growing tumors did not respond to pirfenidone. A placebo-controlled trial is needed to determine whether there is a subset of patients for whom pirfenidone may result in partial shrinkage of desmoid tumors, because the natural history of desmoid tumors is not predictable or understood."

"histology, localization, staging, grading, sex, surgical margins, number of local recurrences. Abdominal wall neoplasm are less aggressive for compartmentalization of muscle layer and with a better prognosis because of their localization, and surgical opportunities of extensive resection (not less of 2 cm from tumor's macroscopic limits) allowed by modern prosthetic reconstruction techniques. Polipropilene seems to be the ideal material for such kind of reconstruction even if also mersilene, PTFEe and others were employed. PTFEe and Dual-meshes could be useful in those malignant tumors in which peritoneum resection is necessary."
"Desmoid tumors are slow growing deep fibromatoses with aggressive infiltration of adjacent tissue but without any metastatic potential. CASE PRESENTATION: We report on two female patients with desmoid tumor of the abdominal wall who underwent primary resection. Both patients had a history of an earlier abdominal surgery. Preoperative evaluation included abdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. The histology in both cases revealed a desmoid tumor. CONCLUSION: Complete surgical resection is the first line management of this tumor entity."
"Deeply seated aggressive fibromatosis also termed as desmoid tumors are rare tumors that invade surrounding structures. Although they never metastasize mortality rate may be as high as 10% due to their aggressive local behavior. Intraabdominal desmoid tumors are usually associated with familial poliposis coli and have a high recurrence rate regardless of the therapy instituted. Sporadic cases are very rare and generous surgical excision may be of benefit. We hereby report 2 siblings with sporadic pancreatic desmoid tumors who also harbor additional fibrotic masses in the pelvis. Although in previously reported cases there is usually a triggering event such as trauma, in the present cases there was no inciting event. Furthermore, the cases are without an associated FAP history, which provides the first clinical clue of a possible genetic determinant in this rare disorder."
"A 69-year-old man had a history of chronic abdominal pain and intermittent fever for more than 10 years. Due to acute epigastric pain and intermittent fever with night sweat for one week he was admitted for further investigation. On physical examination there was tenderness in the right upper and lower epigastrium without a palpable mass. INVESTIGATIONS: Laboratory figures showed signs of inflammation with a CRP of 103 mg/l. Leucocyte counts were normal without left shift. CT and MRI scans showed a sharp-edged mass of 10 x 8 cm in diameter in the retroperitoneal area with big vessels running through it. Laparoscopic biopsy confirmed the suspected diagnosis of retractile mesenteritis. TREATMENT AND COURSE: Under therapy with oral progesterone (Utrogestan 1 x 100 mg/d) and prednisone (Prednison 1 x 50 mg/d) there was fast symptomatic relief. A CT scan 2 months after initial diagnosis showed clear regression of the tumor. CONCLUSION: Retractile mesenteritis is a rare cause of chronic abdominal pain with variable symptoms. Its aetiology is unknown. In case of bowel ischemia a surgical approach is preferred, milder forms may be treated with immunosuppressive agents as well as oral progesterone. Progesterone has exhibited positive effects on fatty tissue with successful treatment in desmoid tumors and retroperitoneal fibrosis. Here in we could demonstrate its safe and efficient use in a patient with retractile mesenteritis."
"one desmoid tumor, eight sarcomas, a recurrence of hepatocarcinoma and four recurrences of breast cancer. The superficial coverage performed by latissimus dorsis flap 12 for cases and rectus abdominis flap for two cases. All the patients were able to produce a spontaneous breath after surgery. Two deaths at distance and an infection were to regret. On the whole the algorithm of reconstruction according to the location of the defect allows a simplification of the indications."

Desmoid tumors are rare fibroblastic neoplasms characterized by highly aggressive local invasion and high recurrence rates after surgical excision. Responses to chemotherapy and radiation therapy are uncommon. The use of percutaneous chemical ablation performed under imaging guidance is described in two patients with recurrent and/or unresectable disease. A complete response was achieved in one patient and a partial response was achieved in the other patient; these responses were sustained during 2 years of follow-up. This technique may hold promise in the treatment of these challenging lesions.

"We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of patients treated with radiotherapy, with or without surgery, for aggressive fibromatosis. The patterns of local failure were analyzed to determine the optimum radiation dose and volume for irradiation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients with histologically confirmed aggressive fibromatosis were treated with radiation therapy at the Yonsei Cancer Center between 1990 and 1998. The radiation dose per patient ranged from 39.6 to 59.4 Gy (mean: 49.4 Gy). The entire operative bed, with a generous margin, was included in the radiotherapy volume. Patients were considered as locally controlled if there was no evidence of the disease during their follow-up period, and if the tumors were stable for more than 2 years. The minimum duration of the follow-up period was 26 months, with a median of 69 months. RESULTS: The actuarial 10-year recurrence-free and overall survival were 88.5 and 100%, respectively. Patients who had a recurrence were salvaged by combined surgery and re-irradiation. Recurrences developed only in patients who had a recurrent disease after surgery and were treated with an inadequate radiation volume. In 9 patients with a gross measurable disease, there were no in-field failures; these had been treated with a median of 50.4 Gy (range: 40-60 Gy) of radiation. Eight patients with a microscopic residual disease were also locally controlled with 41.4-59.4 Gy (median: 45 Gy) of radiation. No patient has developed either secondary malignancy or any serious radiation complications. CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy for aggressive fibromatosis can be an effective treatment option for maintaining a disease-free status. As fibromatosis, with either a microscopic, or a gross residual disease, can be controlled with a moderate dose of radiation, adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy following surgical excision is recommended with the least sufficient margin to preserve good function and cosmesis. The geographic relationship may require a more precise definition; in addition, regardless of the existence of neighborhood normal tissue barriers, a wide coverage of the radiation volume may be needed."
"To report a new technique of laparoscopic ovarian transposition to preserve ovarian function in women who require pelvic irradiation for musculoaponeurotic fibromatosis (extra abdominal desmoid). DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: University teaching hospital. PATIENT(S): Two nulliparous women who required adjunctive radiotherapy for musculoaponeurotic fibromatosis where radiotherapy planning indicated that the right ovary could be removed from the field of radiation by anterior transposition. INTERVENTION(S): Laparoscopic suturing of the right ovary to the right round ligament with intracorporeal polypropylene sutures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Technical feasibility, recovery, postoperative adhesions, ease of ovarian repositioning, and evidence of ovulation after completion of radiotherapy. RESULT(S): The technique was easily performed without needing to divide the ligament of the ovary. Recovery was rapid, and there were no postoperative adhesions. The ovary showed evidence of continued function and was easily repositioned by dividing the sutures. CONCLUSION(S): In selected cases, this method of ovarian transposition has the advantages not only of being technically easy but also of allowing for repositioning of the ovary with minimal disruption of its anatomical relationship to the fallopian tube, thereby favoring fertility."
"Desmoid tumors are uncommon benign tumors composed of fibrous tissue, which originate from aponeuroses. Little is known about their molecular pathogenesis and the reason that they recur. We report the case of a 20-year-old man with a recurrent desmoid tumor of the chest wall, focusing on our analysis of the apoptosis and its related molecular events. Immunohistochemical examination showed higher expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, survivin, and the transcription factor, NF-kappaB, in the recurrent tumor than in the adjoining normal tissue. Proapoptotic Bax was not detected in the tumor. Similar findings were obtained in the original primary tumor. Both tumors had a low apoptotic index according to the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay. These changes occurred in the absence of cell proliferation, shown by the absence of both Ki-67 staining and increased telomerase activity. This derangement of apoptosis gives the aggressive desmoid tumor cells a proliferative advantage, and presumably, forms the basis of its high recurrence rate. Therefore, inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) may be useful for predicting recurrence. The regulation of apoptosis by antisense therapy against these inhibitors could prove beneficial for overcoming repeated recurrence, even after surgery."
"Mice carrying the bovine papillomavirus type I genome develop dermal fibrosarcomas in a multiple step process characterized by distinctive proliferative stages. Chromosomal aberrations are identified early in this tumorigenic pathway, however, the mechanism that originates them is unknown. Using a functional assay, we investigated the status of the mitotic spindle cell cycle checkpoint (MSCCC) that regulates the metaphase to anaphase transition, in cells representing different stages of fibrosarcoma progression. Loss of MSCCC activity was apparent in mild fibromatosis and completely abolished in aggressive fibromatosis and fibrosarcoma lesions. This altered MSCCC status was confirmed biochemically by deregulated expression of Cks1 protein and unscheduled cyclin B metabolism. Immunoprecipitation and sequencing analyses indicated that mutation of p53 was not required for the abrogation of the MSCCC. These results demonstrate that loss of mitotic spindle checkpoint activity predisposes to chromosomal instability at early stages of fibrosarcoma development. To our knowledge, these studies constitute the first report of a transition in MSCCC activity in a tumorigenesis model."
"Desmoplastic fibroma of bone is an exceedingly rare tumor that was first described by Jaffe in 1958 [1]. It has a high incidence of local recurrence after surgical resection. It is usually seen in young patients and involves mandible and long bones. It has histological resemblance to the desmoid tumor of the abdominal wall. We report a surgically proven case of desmoplastic fibroma of bone with local aggressiveness and recurrence during follow-up. The radiograph, CT imaging features, radiological and pathological differential diagnosis of the case are described, and literature is briefly reviewed."
"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), caused by a mutation in the APC gene, is a colorectal cancer predisposition syndrome associated with several other clinical conditions. The severity of the FAP is related to the position of the inherited mutation in the APC gene. We analyzed a large series of FAP patients to identify associations among major clinical manifestations and to correlate the mutation site with specific disease manifestations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: APC mutations were identified in 953 FAP patients from 187 families. We used unconditional logistic regression models and a method involving generalized estimating equations to investigate the association between genotype and phenotype. We used multiple correspondence analysis to represent the interrelationships of a multiway contingency table of the considered variables. RESULTS: APC germline mutations were located between codons 156 and 2011 of the APC gene. Mutations spanning the region between codons 543 and 1309 were variable, but strongly associated with congenital hypertrophy of retinal pigment epithelium. Mutations between codons 1310 and 2011 were associated with a six-fold risk of desmoid tumors relative to the low-risk reference region (159 to 495). Mutations at codon 1309 were associated with early development of colorectal cancer. Mutations between codons 976 and 1067 were associated with a three- to four-fold increased risk of duodenal adenomas. The cumulative frequency of extracolonic manifestations was highest for mutations between codons 976 and 1067, followed by mutations between 1310 and 2011. CONCLUSION: Analysis of the relation between APC mutation site and phenotype identifies subgroups of FAP patients at high risk for major extracolonic disease, which is useful for surveillance and prevention."
"Among tumourous affections of the pleural cavity dominate metastatic processes while primary pleural neoplasms are relatively rare (only 5%). The authors present 4 case-records of less common primary benign pleural tumours which were operated at the Surgical Clinic of the Faculty Hospital in Plzen during 2000. Three women and one man of different age groups were involved. In three patients accidental findings were involved, in one instance in conjunction with multiple injuries, the fourth patient was examined on account of pulmonary complaints. The diagnosis was based on the skiagram and specially on the CT of the lungs, individually also other methods were used. All findings were radically eliminated--twice by thoracotomy, twice using miniinvasive procedures. Histological examination revealed twice desmoidal fibromatosis, once a benign fibrous pleural tumour and once a rare variant of Castleman's disease. The postoperative period was free from major complications, without the need of surgical revision. Two years after surgery all patients are free from detectable signs of relapse. The authors submit at the same time an integrated view on the problem of pleural neoplasias, they discuss in particular the pitfalls of the diagnosis of these lesions, possible treatment, incl. the use of suitable endoscopic methods, and the prognosis of different types of tumours. A more detailed histopathological analysis of the described findings is given."
"Desmoids are rare, locally aggressive but nonmetastasizing clonal proliferations of fibroblasts that occur both sporadically and in association with familial adenomatous polyposis. Most occur in intra-abdominal sites, where they may lead to major morbidity and mortality. A proposed desmoid precursor lesion occurs in the mesentery of one-third of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, and postoperative mesenteric fibromatosis has been identified in 20 percent of such patients. True desmoids occur in 10 percent, which suggests a model of development in which the phenotype becomes increasingly severe in a manner analogous to the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. This work aimed to confirm such a progression. METHODS: A five-point CT scoring system for mesenteric fibromatosis and desmoids was devised and validated, and in doing so, their incidence was observed. In the second part of the study, seven patients known to have a precursor lesion underwent abdominal CT a median of 27.5 months after the surgery that identified the lesion. Scans were assessed by the scoring system and compared with those of a matched control group of familial adenomatous polyposis patients. RESULTS: The CT scoring system was reliable and reproducible. Of 103 scans of asymptomatic patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, mesenteric fibromatosis and desmoid tumors were identified in 21 and 2 percent, respectively. In the follow-up of patients with desmoid precursor lesions, those in the precursor lesion group had a significantly greater degree of mesenteric fibromatosis and desmoid formation than their corresponding controls (P = 0.009, Mann-Whitney U test). CONCLUSION: A reliable CT scoring system for mesenteric fibromatosis and desmoid tumors in familial adenomatous polyposis is presented. Results with this system provide further evidence for a stepwise progression in the development of desmoids."
"We describe the successful treatment of a fibromatosis (desmoid tumor) arising from the prevertebral fascia of the neck. Total resection with wide margins is reportedly the best treatment for this kind of tumor. However, the anatomy of the head and neck makes such resection difficult. In this case, we were unable to completely remove the tumor because it was large and located close to the cervical vertebrae, common carotid artery and internal jugular vein. Incomplete resection is known to result in higher tumor recurrence than complete resection. In addition, the recurrence or progression of a tumor in the head or neck region is known to cause mortality by compression of the airway or major blood vessels. On the basis of reports that irradiation is effective treatment for this kind of tumor, we administered 30-Gy irradiation to the affected area. This therapy was very effective and no sign of recurrence was seen for 2 years after irradiation. We found that function-sparing resection plus postoperative radiotherapy is an effective treatment for advanced fibromatosis in the head and neck regions with proximity to or involvement with vital structures."
Desmoid tumor is a fibroblastic proliferation arising in musculoaponeurotic tissues. We report a case of abdominal desmoid tumor discovered 2 years after radical nephrectomy for right renal cell carcinoma. Surgical extirpation was performed and the patient remained well 2 years later with no evidence of disease. The possibility of desmoid tumors developing in the incised abdominal wall should be considered while following patients after surgery.
"To explore prognostic factors in surgically treated aggressive fibromatosis (extra-abdominal desmoid tumor). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 203 consecutive patients treated with surgery over a 35-year period at a single referral center were retrospectively reviewed. One hundred twenty-eight were first seen at our institution with primary disease, whereas 75 had a recurrent tumor. All patients underwent macroscopically complete resection. Margins were rated as negative in 146 (97 with primary tumors, 49 with recurrences) and positive in 57 (31 in primary, 26 in recurrences) patients. Median follow-up was 135 months. RESULTS: Patients with primary disease had a better disease-free survival rate than those with recurrence (76% v 59% at 10 years). Presenting with a recurrence was also the strongest predictor of local failure in the multivariate analysis. In patients first treated for primary disease, size and site had prognostic significance, whereas microscopically positive surgical margins did not. In contrast, in patients with recurrence, there was a trend toward better prognosis if margins were negative (although this was not significant at multivariate analysis). CONCLUSION: Presence of microscopic disease does not necessarily affect long-term disease-free survival in patients with primary presentation of extra-abdominal desmoid tumors. Thus, function-sparing surgery may be a reasonable choice when feasible without leaving macroscopic residual disease. In patients with recurrences, positive margins may more clearly affect prognosis, potentially necessitating adjuvant radiation in selected cases."
"Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a rare mesenchymal proliferation of transformed myofibroblasts, with a prominent inflammatory cell component, that can mimic other spindle cell processes such as nodular fasciitis, desmoid tumor, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Genetic analyses have recently demonstrated rearrangements of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), located at 2p23, in a subset of IMTs. Molecular characterizations have identified ALK fusions involving tropomyosin-3 and -4 (TPM-3 and -4), the clathrin heavy chain (CLTC), and the cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CARS) genes as fusion partners. Here we describe two IMTs with a novel ALK fusion that involves the Ran-binding protein 2 (RANBP2) gene at 2q13, which normally encodes a large (358-kDa) nucleopore protein localized at the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex. The N-terminal 867 residues of RANBP2 are fused to the cytoplasmic segment of ALK in the 1,430-amino acid RANBP2-ALK chimeric protein. Myofibroblasts that express RANBP2-ALK exhibit nuclear membrane-associated ALK staining that is unique compared to the subcellular localization observed with other ALK fusions in IMT, presumably attributable to heteroassociation of the fusion with normal RANBP2 at the nuclear pore. These findings expand the spectrum of ALK abnormalities observed in IMT and further confirm the clonal, neoplastic nature of these lesions."
"four patients had no residual disease following surgical resection (mean follow-up 16.3 months) and one patient who had an incomplete surgical resection had stable disease at 26 months. In summary, we report a series of distinct intraabdominal fibroinflammatory pseudotumors that we have collectively termed ""reactive nodular fibrous pseudotumors."" These lesions are uncommon and may infiltrate the bowel wall, thereby mimicking primary bowel neoplasms or intraabdominal fibromatosis. Recognition of these nonneoplastic lesions is important, as they pursue a benign clinical course, but may be confused with other mesenchymal neoplasms that require more aggressive treatment."

"Desmoid tumor of bone, also termed desmoplastic fibroma or aggressive fibromatosis, is a rare, locally aggressive fibroblastic tumor. We present a 16-year-old male with a huge desmoid tumor involving the iliac wing. It was associated with enchondromatous nodules mimicking malignancy. The tumor in this patient was mistaken for chondrosarcoma and hemipelvectomy was performed. To our knowledge, such a case has not previously been documented fully in the English literature. The radiographic and pathologic findings and a possible mechanism of enchondromatous nodule formation in fibrous bone tumors are discussed."

"0 both antibodies stained substantial numbers of desmoids: with/without HIER, A4502, 89%/63%; C-19, 37%/74%. The staining was cytoplasmic without cell membrane accentuation. However, background stromal staining and nonspecific staining of endothelium and smooth and striated muscle were problematic with both antibodies at 1:50. At higher dilutions, C-19 stained no desmoid; however, diminished staining of external and internal control samples made it unreliable. A4502 similarly stained many fewer desmoids at higher dilutions. However, it retained strong staining of both external and internal control samples and showed much less nonspecific staining. Best results were achieved at 1:250 without HIER; only weak focal staining was present in 1 desmoid. With a simple immunohistochemical method optimized for clinical use, desmoid can be regarded as a c-Kit-negative tumor."
"Fibroosseous lesions are rare entities of the nose and paranasal sinuses, the terminology and classification of which are still confusing. Psammomatoid or aggressive (juvenile) ossifying fibroma is a benign messenchymal tumor usually met in the young age (5-15 years), in the sinonasal tract, bearing distinctive histomorphologic features and a tendency towards locally aggressive behaviour. METHODOLOGY: We report here a rare case of an aggressive psammomatoid ossifying fibroma of the inferior turbinate and the lateral nasal wall, with obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct, in a 68-year-old woman. RESULTS: Diagnosis was based on physical examination, CT scan imaging and histopathological examination. Treatment consisted of endoscopic intranasal resection of the tumor accompanied by removal of the lateral nasal wall. CONCLUSIONS: Fibro-osseous tumors of the nose and paranasal sinuses require aggressive surgical approach in order to avoid recurrence. Complete surgical excision may not always be possible mainly due to the tumor's extent and location."
"Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is often used in the detection and staging of large pelvic masses. Many large masses in the female pelvis arise from the reproductive organs (eg, uterus, cervix, ovaries, fallopian tubes). In addition, these masses may arise from the gastrointestinal system, urinary system, adjacent soft tissues, peritoneum, or retroperitoneum or from metastases. The majority of large masses in the female pelvis represent such commonly encountered entities as uterine fibroid tumor, dermoid tumor, ovarian cyst, and ovarian cancer. However, uncommon pelvic masses such as mesothelioma, adenocarcinoma, carcinosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and desmoid tumor may also be seen. Thus, the differential diagnosis for female pelvic masses is extensive. However, the site of origin, MR imaging characteristics, and clinical history may all help narrow the differential diagnosis. Although with large tumors it may not always be possible to determine the site of origin or distinguish between various tumors at radiology, familiarity with the clinicopathologic and MR imaging features of common and uncommon pelvic masses is important for diagnosis and treatment."
"The authors report about clinico-morphological features in four cases of spindle-cell metaplastic carcinoma of the breast, closely mimicking benign soft tissue fibromatosis or nodular fasciitis. All patients were females aged 54-72 years with a palpable nodule within the breast, 20-35 mm in size. Histologically, the tumor infiltrated surrounding tissue; it consisted of spindle cells with relatively bland morphology, arranged in a fascicular, storiform or random fashion. Mitotic activity was low, focally the tumors revealed regressive changes (hyalinization, myxoid degeneration). Cytokeratin expression was proven in all four cases. In two patients the tumor metastasized and the patients died of it; this fact confirms recently published data that despite its deceptively benign appearance, fibromatosis--like carcinoma of the breast is undoubtedly a malignant process with potentially aggressive behaviour. Differential diagnosis of this unusual variant of metaplastic breast carcinoma is discussed together with related therapeutic issues."
"Glucocorticoids inhibit proliferation of many cell types, but the relationship between the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the proteins regulating cell cycle progression is not fully understood. We previously found that during fibrosarcoma (FS) progression, GR displays only modest transcriptional activity in the preneoplastic stages, whereas it is highly active in FS cells. Now, we report that glucocorticoids reduce proliferation throughout FS development. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16(INK4a) is frequently absent in many cancers, including FSs. We observed that p16(INK4a) protein expression is lost at the tumor stage of FS progression. Treatment with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restores p16(INK4a) expression and reverts the phenotype of FS cells to low GR transcriptional activity, similar to that of the p16(INK4a)-expressing preneoplastic stages. Importantly, exogenous p16(INK4a) introduced by cotransfection is sufficient to reduce GR activity in FS cells, without affecting GR activity in p16-positive aggressive fibromatosis cells. Furthermore, GR transcriptional activity is elevated in mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from INK4a(-/-) mice compared with those derived from WT mice, implying that the difference in p16(INK4a) expression is sufficient to modulate GR activity. These results suggest a relationship between steroid hormone receptor activity and cell cycle inhibition, whereby absence of p16(INK4a) protein leads to higher GR transactivation activity and reduced cell sensitivity to dexamethasone. This observation might have important implications for current cancer therapies."
"The management of aggressive fibromatosis (AF) is problematic, and few options are available to patients unsuitable for surgery and resistant to external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT). We report on two patients with fast-growing recurrences of AF resistant to EBRT who obtained protracted clinical benefits with (90)Y-DOTATOC. (90)Y-DOTATOC should be further investigated in this setting."
"The purpose of this study was to review treatment results for primary soft tissue sarcomas of the head and neck in order to determine prognostic factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1970 to 2000, 44 adult patients were diagnosed with a biopsy-proven, nonmetastatic primary soft tissue sarcoma in a head and neck subsite; were treated with curative intent; and had adequate follow-up and records for our review. Patients with extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, and desmoid tumor were excluded. The most common tumor histologies included malignant fibrous histiocytoma (15 patients), angiosarcoma (nine patients), fibrosarcoma (six patients), and leiomyosarcoma (six patients). RESULTS: The median overall survival for all patients was 79 months. The actuarial 5-year local control for all patients was 55% and was highly correlated with the extent of surgical excision: 25% for subtotal resection/debulking, 65% for wide local excision, and 100% for radical excision. Local control at 5 years was 60% for patients treated with both surgery and radiotherapy, 54% for those treated with surgery alone, and 43% for those treated with radiotherapy alone. Adjuvant radiotherapy significantly improved the local control rates (from 25% to 54%) for patients with close (<2 mm) or positive surgical margins. Of 14 patients with locoregional failure in whom salvage was attempted, nine (64%) were rendered disease free. CONCLUSIONS: Multimodality therapy with both surgery and radiotherapy improves local control, particularly in patients with close or positive surgical margins. Aggressive attempts at salvage therapy for locoregional failures are warranted and frequently produce long-term disease control."
"Imaging-guided core needle biopsy is a well-established technique for the diagnosis of bone and soft tissue tumors and tumor-like lesions in specialized orthopedic oncology centers. OBJECTIVE: To present our results of computed tomography-guided core needle biopsy with assessment of the accuracy of the technique. METHODS: Between July 1998 and October 2000, 215 CT-guided core needle biopsies were performed and histologically examined in the Unit of Bone and Soft Tissue Pathology, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. There were 80 soft tissue and 135 bony lesions. All biopsies were performed by the same radiologist and the histologic examination by the same pathologist. To assess the accuracy of the procedure, we compared the diagnosis at biopsy with the diagnosis after definitive surgery (when available). RESULTS: Bone core needle biopsy (n = 135) showed malignancy in 89 cases (primary or recurrent bone sarcoma, lymphoma, myeloma, metastatic carcinoma or melanoma). There were 29 benign lesions. In 17 cases the result was inconclusive and an open incisional biopsy was performed. Of the 80 soft tissue biopsies, 35 were malignant (25 soft tissue sarcomas, 6 lymphomas, 4 metastatic carcinomas); 40 were benign (myositis ossificans, neurofibroma, desmoid tumor, schwannoma, hematoma and others), and 5 were inconclusive and followed by an open incisional biopsy. The core needle biopsy histologic diagnosis was compared with that of the definitive surgery and the diagnostic accuracy was 90%. Only three samples initially diagnosed as benign turned out to be malignant. No significant complications occurred during the procedures. CONCLUSIONS: CT-guided CNB of musculoskeletal lesions is a safe and effective procedure that assures sufficient and proper material for histologic examination. The accuracy of this method in our center was 90%. Tumor sampling is extremely important, especially in soft tissue sarcomas, and cores should be taken in different directions, including areas of necrosis. The processing is quick, especially for bone CNB, and diagnosis can be achieved within 24 hours. The material undergoes excellent fixation and the immunostains are reliable."
"Desmoid tumor (aggressive fibromatosis) is an aggressive fibroblastic proliferation of well circumscribed, locally invasive, differentiated fibrous tissue. For patients with desmoid tumors that are not amenable to surgery or radiation therapy, the use of hormonal agents and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been attempted, with some success. The use of chemotherapy also has been reported to have activity. METHODS: Seven patients (5 males and 2 females) with a median age of 40 years (range, 17-66 years) who received cytotoxic chemotherapy (combinations of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin; mitomycin, doxorubicin, and cisplatin; and ifosfamide and etoposide) for desmoid tumor were reviewed retrospectively. Five patients were found to have recurrent tumors. Four patients had familial adenomatous polyposis. Four patients had failed tamoxifen and six had failed NSAIDs prior to receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. In six patients the desmoid tumor was intraabdominal and one tumor had occurred on the buttock. RESULTS: Patients received a median number of six cycles of chemotherapy (range, two to eight cycles). Objective disease regression occurred in 3 patients. There was an apparent clinical benefit in six patients with the duration of benefit ranging from 3 months to 15 years. The chemotherapy was well tolerated and no treatment-related mortality was reported. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study indicate that the use of combination chemotherapy for desmoid tumors may provide long-term clinical benefits."

"Despite the use of surgery and radiotherapy, 20-35% of patients with aggressive fibromatosis (AF) will have local recurrence. The purpose of this review was to collect and analyze all available information regarding the role of non-cytotoxic and cytotoxic chemotherapy in AF that has been accumulated over the past few decades. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A systematic review of published clinical trials, studies and case series was carried out using the Medline Express Databases and the Cochrane Collaboration Database from 1970 to October 2000. RESULTS: Most studies published in the literature are in the form of successful case reports and single-arm series with small patient numbers. Most commonly used agents include hormonal agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), interferons and cytotoxics. The literature data support the use of hormonal agents. Several questions, however, remain unresolved, such as which is the most suitable endocrine manipulation and what is the optimal dose and duration of treatment. NSAIDs and interferons have demonstrated activity against AF either alone or in combination with hormone therapy or chemotherapy but the precise mechanism of action is still unknown. Finally, there is growing evidence in the literature that chemotherapy is effective against AF with almost one in two patients being likely to respond. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence in the literature supports the opinion that both non-cytotoxic and cytotoxic chemotherapies are effective against AF. However, the lack of sufficient patient numbers and randomized trials compromises the validity of the reported results and mandates further investigation with properly designed prospective studies including larger patient numbers, with main end points to include not only tumor response rate and survival but also quality-of-life issues."

"A desmoid tumor of the mediastinum was diagnosed and treated in a 35-year-old white male who presented with a right supraclavicular mass. He was treated with resection, which involved several vascular structures, requiring multiple vascular reconstructions followed by post-operative radiotherapy. The authors concluded that, when located in the mediastinum, the invasive character of such tumors and its tendency to recur may pose a considerable surgical challenge, requiring careful pre-operative planning and long term post-operative follow -up. The role of radiation therapy is limited to the control of local recurrences."

"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) arises following mutation or loss of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Desmoid tumours are proliferations of fibroblasts and occur as an extracolonic manifestation of FAP. They are a leading cause of death after colectomy. The aim of this study was to assess the potential for APC gene transfer into fibroblasts in vitro and in vivo as a basis for consideration of gene therapy in the prevention or treatment of desmoid tumours. METHODS: The APC gene was transferred by lipofection into fibroblasts in tissue culture and into peritoneum and small bowel mesentery in vivo. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to determine whether or not transfection was successful. RESULTS: Transgene expression was recorded in vitro to 7 days after transfection. High levels of transgene expression were also seen in samples of peritoneum (all eight mice), small bowel mesentery (seven of eight), liver (seven of eight) and intestinal tissues (five to six of eight) following intraperitoneal treatment. Interestingly, transgene expression in gonadal tissues was occasionally noted. CONCLUSION: Liposomal transfection of APC gave prolonged high-level expression of the transgene, an important basis for gene therapy. No adverse effects were recorded. Further work is needed in animal models of desmoid disease to assess the clinical effects of gene therapy."
"Desmoid tumor represents a rare monoclonal neoplasm arising from deep musculoaponeurotic structures and may occur sporadically or in association with the familial adenomatous polyposis and Gardner syndromes. Desmoid tumors do not appear to demonstrate metastatic potential; however, local infiltrative growth results in significant morbidity and potential mortality. Although the delineation of optimal therapy for desmoid tumors has been confounded by several factors, surgical resection with adjuvant radiotherapy for a positive surgical margin remains the standard approach. Responses have been demonstrated to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, antiestrogen compounds, and a variety of other agents in small series. Imatinib mesylate appears to demonstrate inhibitory activity against multiple class 3 receptor tyrosine kinases, including platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-alpha and PDGFR-beta, as well as c-kit. METHODS: The authors performed immunohistochemical and qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis on nine desmoid tumor specimens that demonstrated consistent positivity for c-kit as well as PDGFR-alpha and PDGFR-beta. At the time of last follow-up, 2 patients had received therapy with imatinib mesylate at a dose of 400 mg twice daily. RESULTS: Both patients demonstrated ongoing radiographic and clinical responses with a duration of 9 months and 11 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib mesylate has been reported to have activity against desmoid tumor, most likely because of c-kit and PDGFR receptor tyrosine kinase activity inhibition, and warrants further study. The relative novelty of this agent and the lack of long-term toxicity data should prompt its use only in the salvage setting in which established local and systemic approaches fail to control disease. In addition, the use of imatinib mesylate in the treatment of this neoplasm preferably should be in the context of a formal prospective clinical trial."
"We report a 72-year-old man with sporadic intra-abdominal desmoid tumor manifesting as acute abdomen. CT scan revealed an air-containing tumor 7 cm in diameter; three weeks later, the tumor had shrunk to 4 cm on antibiotics. At surgery, a tumor arising from the transverse colon mesentery and infiltrating the jejunum was resected. No recurrence occurred over a 1-year follow-up."
"Desmoid tumor can be defined as a pseudoencapsulated infiltrative growth of well-differentiated collagenous fibroblasts and fibrocytes arising either in fascia or musculoaponeurotic structures. The etiology of desmoid tumors is poorly defined. The most commonly implicated etiologic factors are trauma, hormonal disturbances, and genetic or hereditary factors. Desmoid tumors of the anterior abdominal wall are much less common than extra-abdominal desmoids; they may occur at any age but are most common in the third and fourth decades. Although both sexes may be affected, abdominal desmoids predominate in females, particularly in females of childbearing age. Extra-abdominal desmoids, which most commonly occur on the back, chest wall, head and neck, or lower extremity, have a male predominance. Most patients complain of a painless mass of several months or years' duration. The primary consideration in surgical treatment of desmoid tumors should be the prevention of local recurrence. In most instances, this can be achieved by wide local excision or muscle group resection. There is no clear evidence that irradiation or chemotherapy are effective in controlling desmoid tumors."
"Desmoid tumours are uncommon benign neoplasms. They arise from fascial and musculoaponeurotic tissues and are locally infiltrative, resulting in a high rate of local recurrence following surgical resection. They present difficult loco-regional control. The location and extent of the tumour, as well as the potential for significant morbidity and mortality, dictate the most appropriate therapeutic option. Complete surgical extirpation is the optimal treatment for primary and recurrent desmoid tumours. Radiotherapy is indicated in incompletely excised or recurrent tumours. Radiation as a primary treatment is seldom recommended. A case of desmoid tumour of the neck, primarily treated with radical radiation, is described and relevant literature reviewed."
"Extra-abdominal fibromatosis (desmoid tumour) is a rare aggressive neoplasm with a tendency to infiltrate local structures but rarely metastasises or undergoes spontaneous malignant transformation. The treatment of choice is surgery, however, recurrences have been reported even after wide-field resection. This article presents a case of extra-abdominal fibromatosis that had extensively invaded the mandible."

A rare case of an extra-abdominal desmoid tumour in the hand is reported. Its treatment and a short survey of the literature is given.
"Abnormalities of chromosome 2p23 with expression of ALK1 and p80 occur in both inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma. This immunohistochemical study investigates whether the ALK family of neoplasms includes fibroblastic-myofibroblastic, myogenic, and spindle cell tumors. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archival tissues from 10 IMTs and 125 other soft tissue tumors were stained for ALK1 and p80 with standard immunohistochemistry. ALK1 and/or p80 reactivity was observed in a cytoplasmic pattern in IMT (4/10; 40%), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (4/10; 40%), rhabdomyosarcoma (6/31; 19%), leiomyosarcoma (1/10; 10%), and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (1/11; 9%). No staining was observed in nodular fasciitis, desmoid, infantile myofibromatosis, infantile fibrosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, leiomyoma, or myofibrosarcoma. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas (4/16; 25%) displayed a distinctive dot-like cytoplasmic positivity. No cases displayed nuclear reactivity. Fluorescent in situ hybridization on 12 of the positive cases revealed a combination of abnormalities including ALK break-apart signals, nucleophosmin (NPM)/ALK fusions, or extra copies of 2p23. This study demonstrates that in addition to IMT, abnormalities of ALK1 and p80 expression with a variety of structural chromosomal changes are found in several sarcomas, especially rhabdomyosarcoma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. Although immunoreactivity in non-IMTs cannot distinguish between structural abnormalities involving 2p23 or additional copies of 2p23, it supports the concept of ALK involvement in a larger group of neoplasms, some of which have other documented clonal abnormalities. In IMT, immunohistochemistry for ALK1 and p80 is useful as an indicator of a 2p23 abnormality, but it must be interpreted in the context of histologic and other clinicopathologic data if used as an adjunct to differential diagnosis."
"Fibromatosis is a locally aggressive, proliferative fibroblastic lesion affecting musculoaponeurotic structures, most often in the limbs and trunk. Intracranial fibromatosis is extremely rare and requires aggressive treatment to prevent recurrence. We present the case of a 48 year old woman with aggressive skull base fibromatosis. The lesion extended through the sphenoid sinus, into both pterygoid recesses, destroying the right lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus and invading the cavernous sinus. There was also involvement of the floor of the sella, the clivus, the right petrous temporal bone and the right mastoid. The patient underwent partial resection of the lesion via an extended trans-sphenoidal approach. Postoperative MRI showed residual tissue. A review of the literature shows that intracranial fibromatosis usually appears in the first or second decade. Complete resection is often impossible because of its widely infiltrative nature. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are often required to improve local control of the lesion."
"To review a large single-institution experience in the management of aggressive fibromatosis to determine the effectiveness of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and identify the presentation and treatment variables predictive of locoregional control. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1975 and 2000, 72 patients were treated with EBRT for a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of aggressive fibromatosis. Thirty patients were treated at the primary presentation and 42 at the time of a locoregional recurrence. Minimal 2-year follow-up data were available for 65 patients (median 6 years). Megavoltage irradiation with 60Co to 20 MV photons or electron therapy was used for all patients. Most patients were treated after attempted complete surgical resection; 16 patients underwent pretreatment biopsy alone. The prescribed treatment was standard (1.8 Gy) daily fractions in 42 cases and 1.2 Gy fractions b.i.d. in 23 cases. The median prescribed dose was 54 Gy. The prognostic variables and treatment results were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier actuarial analysis. RESULTS: Locoregional control was achieved in 52 of 65 patients. The 5-year actuarial locoregional control was 83%. Locoregional failure occurred in 13 patients (11 in patients with recurrent tumors). Only two failures occurred within the irradiation fields; nine failures occurred at the field margins. Eleven patients were salvaged by surgery: wide excision in nine and amputation in two. The only prognostic factor significant for locoregional control was primary vs. recurrent presentation (p = 0.0193). The 5-year locoregional control rates for irradiation at initial presentation and at recurrence were 96% and 75%, respectively. The variables without significance for locoregional control included primary tumor location, surgical procedures performed, resection margins, and gross vs. microscopic residual tumor at irradiation. Lymphedema was the most common late effect, occurring in 7 patients, 5 with prior treatment. Bone fracture occurred in 3 patients; all 3 had fibromatosis involving the bone at presentation but without recurrence at the time of fracture. CONCLUSION: EBRT is effective treatment for aggressive fibromatosis. The probability of locoregional control decreases with multiple prior recurrences."
"After resection, desmoid tumors are associated with a recurrence rate that is typically 25-50%. Although this is an unusual problem, we instituted a prospective cohort study with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation, followed by surgical resection, in an effort to improve local control. METHODS: Between 1985 and 1999, 13 patients with potentially resectable disease were managed with a treatment protocol of preoperative doxorubicin (30 mg continuous infusion daily for 3 days) and radiotherapy (10 x 300 cGy). Resection was performed 4-6 weeks later. All lesions were resected with an intended margin of 1 cm, but clear adventitial margins were accepted in order to preserve critical structures. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 71 months (range, 22-109). Six patients (46%) presented after failure of a previous surgery. Clear microscopic margins were obtained in 11 patients, and 2 patients had positive margins. There were two local recurrences (15% local recurrence). Both recurrences followed resection of large thigh lesions, which appeared at 30 and 49 months of follow-up. In one patient with a chest wall tumor, two new primary desmoid tumors developed outside the treatment area, in the ipsilateral arm and forearm. Eleven patients have been disease free for a median of 71 months (range, 22-109). CONCLUSIONS: For potentially resectable lesions, this protocol provides excellent local control, even in those with recurrent disease. Neoadjuvant treatment with doxorubicin and radiotherapy appears to be a better option than surgery alone, or surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. These results need to be confirmed in larger, prospective randomized trials."
"Desmoid tumours (DT) are slow-growing tumours that consist of proliferations of well-differentiated fibroblasts. Although the typical characteristics of malignant tumours, such as distant metastases, are absent, the tumours are locally aggressive and grow into neighbouring structures. The prevalence of desmoid tumours in patients with FAP is 7-12%. The lifetime risk of developing desmoid tumours is about 20%. In FAP, most tumours are intra-abdominal or located in the abdominal wall. Next to colorectal cancer, desmoid tumours are the most frequent cause of death in FAP. Possible risk factors for the development of desmoid tumours are previous surgical procedures, pregnancy, female sex, a family history of desmoid tumours, and specific mutations in the APC-gene. Both CT scanning and MRI can be used to detect the tumours. An excision biopsy is needed to establish the diagnosis. Medicinal treatment with NSAIDs is the treatment of first choice, followed by hormonal treatment (e.g., tamoxifen) in combination with NSAIDs. Both forms of treatment lead to a response in about 30-50% of the patients. Surgery is the preferred treatment for extra-abdominal tumours or tumours located in the abdominal wall. Surgical treatment of intra-abdominal tumours is only indicated in patients with obstruction of the bowel or ureter. Chemotherapy is indicated in patients with progressive desmoid tumours when non-cytotoxic treatment has failed. Radiotherapy may play a role in the treatment of irresectable extra-abdominal or abdominal wall tumours, or as adjuvant treatment of tumours with positive margins."
"The purpose of this retrospective analysis is to evaluate whether the combination of surgery and radiation therapy in patients with aggressive fibromatosis influences the therapeutic outcome. METHOD: Clinical, radiological and pathological results of 23 consecutive cases with histologically proven aggressive fibromatosis were retrospectively analyzed. The median follow-up was 59 months. RESULTS: Twelve patients received surgery alone for their first treatment, 10 patients had a combination of surgery and radiotherapy and 1 patient had radiochemotherapy. Of 23 patients 14 (63%) had one or more local recurrences and 9 (39%) were recurrence-free. The patients received a total of 50 treatments: 29/50 (58%) treatments were followed by a local recurrence and 21/50 (42%) were without relapse. Twenty-nine treatments with local recurrence consisted of 25/29 (86%) surgical treatments, 3/29 (10%) combinations of surgery and radiation therapy, and 1/29 (3%) radiochemotherapy. Of the patients who had only surgery for their first treatment, after one year 8 of 12 (66%) and after 5 years all patients had a local recurrence. In the group with surgery and radiotherapy, there was no recurrence after 1 year and 1 recurrence after 5 years (p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: We recommend a complete tumor resection, without mutilating the patient. Radiation therapy in combination with surgery in contrast to surgery alone is an efficient treatment option for reducing local recurrence."
"To describe the MR appearance of extra-abdominal desmoid fibromatosis, especially using sequences such as MR angiography, STIR and FAT SAT. Materials and methods. We reviewed retrospectively the MRI studies of 8 patients (4 men and 4 women) with histologically proved desmoid fibromatosis. In five patients the lesion corresponded to recurrent disease. Eleven MRI examinations were available (Siemens, Vision, 1.5T) including the following sequences: pre- and postcontrast T1 weighted (11 cases), STIR (9 cases), and MRA (3 cases). All lesions were imaged in at least two orthogonal planes. CT was available for 5 patients. RESULTS: The lesions were localized to the girdles in 8 cases and to the upper extremity in 3 cases. Most lesions (10/11) were isointense to muscle on noncontrast T1W images and showed intense enhancement on postcontrast T1W images. All lesions (9/9) were hyperintense on STIR images. CONCLUSION: A STIR sequence is useful as a first sequence to identify smaller lesions (usually recurrences) and to better adapt the FOV of following sequences, especially before administration of intravenous contrast. MR angiography may be valuable for surgical planning."
"Extra-abdominal desmoid fibromatosis is an uncommon tumour. We present here two exceptional familial cases of extra-abdominal desmoid fibromatosis, one of which was synchronous and metachronous. METHODS AND RESULTS: The first patient was a 37-year-old woman who had noted a tumour growing on the dorsum of her right foot when she was 12 years old. She underwent excision of the tumour but in the following year the tumour recurred locally and grew into multiple nodules. Subsequently, multicentric tumours appeared in her knee, distal and posterior aspects of her thigh, right back and right anterior shoulder. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia of the femur and cranium was found on radiological examination. The second patient was a 74-year-old man, the uncle of the first patient. He underwent an excisional operation of a tumour on the internal malleolus surface of his fibula when he was 46 years old. The tumour recurred 7 years later and was excised. His post-operative course has been uneventful. The histology of the primary and recurrent tumours was distinctive and consistently showed hyalinizing scar-like features. CONCLUSIONS: Familial cases of extra-abdominal desmoid fibromatosis with extensive multicentric lesions and distinctive hyalinizing scar-like features are described. Recently, attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis with familial desmoid fibromatosis has been recognized, and familial desmoid fibromatosis without adenomatous polyposis may also be one of its variants. Although the present cases have no history of colon polyposis or carcinoma, monitoring of the intestinal tract would seem to be indicated."

"Fibromatosis represents a group of fibrous tumors showing clinic and biologic features between benign fibrous lesions and fibrosarcoma. These locally aggressive tumors have high recurrence rates (20% to 70%). A four-year-old boy presented with mandibular fibromatosis occupying the mandible completely and extending to the submandibular gland and soft tissues. Complete hemimandibulectomy and submandibular gland excision were performed followed by reconstruction with a curved Kirschner wire. No signs of recurrence was observed during a follow-up period of 18 months. In addition, no limitations in the functions of the jaw, mastication, and swallowing were noted."
"Reports on the association of papillary thyroid carcinoma with paraganglionic or desmoid tumors have appeared infrequently. The former setting usually affects middle-aged females; the latter is typical of familial adenomatous polyposis. We report the case of a 69-yr-old man in whom two abdominal masses had been instrumentally detected following an access of abdominal pain. Save for a moderate hypertension, he was asymptomatic and an impalpable thyroid nodule was detected by ultrasonography. A high urinary noradrenaline output and cytology of the masses raised the suspicion of pheochromocytoma. At laparotomy, an adrenal pheochromocytoma and a paracaval paraganglioma were excised. Subsequently, hemithyroidectomy was performed, and histopathology revealed papillary microcarcinoma. A nodule of desmoid tumor was also removed from the abdominal wall. An analysis of RET, APC, and TP53 gene mutations, and of RET and NTRK1 gene rearrangements, yielded negative results. No in vitro transforming activity was detected in the tumor DNA when assayed in transfection experiments. The lack of a consistent family history also made unlikely the possibility of identifying the putative germline defect by linkage analyses. Should this unusual aggregation of tumors represent a new entity, a number of genetic alterations have now been excluded."
Primary perineal tumours in adults are rare entities that have been infrequently reported (one clinical series of nine patients with sarcoma and isolated case reports). We present our experience of perineal tumours better to characterize and define the natural history of this condition. METHODS: Perineal tumours occurring in adults (>18 years) from January 1990 were identified from the Royal Marsden Hospital's Sarcoma Unit prospective database. RESULTS: Nineteen perineal soft-tissue tumours (12 malignant and seven benign) were evaluated and treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital during this period. Liposarcoma (n=3) and aggressive angiomyxoma (n=4) were the most frequent histological subtypes. Three malignant and four benign tumours were larger than 10 cm. Most tumours were located deep to the deep fascia. Local recurrence in those with sarcoma occurred in one of five patients with negative microscopic margins and in one of two patients who had positive microscopic margins. One patient each with aggressive angiomyxoma and fibromatosis recurred locally. CONCLUSION: Aggressive treatment in the form of wide local excision is associated with fewer local recurrences in adults with primary perineal soft-tissue tumours. The aim of surgical treatment should be to obtain negative resection margins without causing disturbance to urinary or anorectal function.
"We evaluated prognostic factors for local recurrence-free survival, including expression of estrogen receptors, after surgical treatment of aggressive fibromatosis in 72 patients (53 women) having primary tumors between 1970 and 1998. Their median age at diagnosis was 31(1 month-77 years) years. 50 patients had extraabdominal and 22 abdominal fibromatosis. Median tumor size was 4 (1-27) cm. 8 patients were treated with an intralesional resection, 32 with marginal, 31 with wide and with radical resection. They were followed for a median of 8 (1-27) years. The overall and local recurrence-free 5-year survival rates were 98% and 73%, respectively. Univariate analysis identified age, compartmentalization and tumor size as prognostic factors for local recurrence-free survival as well as radiotherapy in extraabdominal tumors. In the multivariate analysis, tumor size > 4 cm, extracompartmental location, inadequate margin and age < 32 years were independent negative prognostic factors for local recurrence. None of the tumors expressed estrogen receptors. In conclusion, aggressive fibromatosis as a high local recurrence rate, but a good prognosis, since almost no patients die of their tumor."
"enucleation in 2 cases; exofacial partial parotidectomy (PP) in 1; lower polar PP with functional neck dissection in 1; total parotidectomy (TP) with preservation of the facial nerve in 31 cases; TP with functional neck dissection in 2; TP with sectioning of the facial nerve in 2 and TP with transmandibular buccopharyngectomy and myocutaneous gran dorsal muscle flap in 1 case. Histology proved positive for the following: pleomorphous adenoma in 21 cases, adenocarcinoma in 11, aggressive fibromatosis in 2, cystadenolymphoma in 1, parotiditis in 1, lipoma in 1, cystic lymphoid hyperplasia in 1, histiofibrosarcoma in 1 and neurofibrosarcoma in 1. The surgical technique used was retrograde dissection of the facial nerve starting from one of the peripheral branches. Post-operatively, whenever a facial paralysis was encountered it proved difficult to recover. Paralysis of the nerve was permanent only in the 2 subjects where sectioning proved necessary because of infiltration by carcinoma. In 6 subjects recovery of the paralysis took one year, in 4 it took 6 months and in 2 other cases 3 months. In 22 cases there was only a slight paralysis of some branches which recovered during the post-operative period. We do not have definitive data on 4 subjects either because the period of time since surgery is still too short or because they did not come in for subsequent check-ups. The results of our study show that total parotidectomy should be the treatment of choice in case of benign parotid gland tumors and in particular for pleomorphic adenoma."
"This report describes a case of successful surgical excision of an intrathoracic paraspinal desmoid tumor with an intraspinous extension causing scoliosis and paralysis in a 12-year-old girl. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this report is to illustrate the potential spectrum of disease of a desmoid tumor and to make physicians aware of the rare possibility of an intraspinal extension of a paraspinal desmoid tumor. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Surgical excision of desmoid tumors in the pediatric population is the standard of care for initial treatment. There have been no clinical reports in the spine literature of a desmoid tumor causing scoliosis or of a desmoid tumor with an intraspinous extension causing paralysis. METHODS: The tumor was decompressed from a posterior approach followed by an anterior resection and an anterior spinal fusion. Two weeks later a posterior spinal fusion was performed to correct the spinal deformity. The patient also received radiation therapy after surgery for 5 weeks. RESULTS: The patient tolerated the procedure well, has been free of recurrence for 9 years, and is currently doing well. CONCLUSION: This case report should help expand the understanding of the spectrum of this uncommon tumor."
"Because of the wide variety of anatomic locations and patient factors, there is no one treatment that is appropriate for all desmoid tumors. The type of treatment depends on tumor characteristics and location, as well as patient characteristics and preferences. Desmoid tumors can be persistent and frustrating to manage because no one treatment modality offers a high likelihood of remission. Multiple modalities may be necessary in some patients. Although mortality is rare and is usually due to local complications, significant disability or morbidity can result from desmoid tumors, their treatment, and complications arising from treatment. The entire clinical picture and the patient's preferences must be taken into account when deciding on an appropriate treatment plan. Patients with desmoid tumors are optimally managed in a multidisciplinary setting with close collaboration between surgeon, pathologist, diagnostic radiologist, radiation oncologist, and medical oncologist. When possible, surgical resection with negative margins is the preferred modality. When surgical resection with negative margins may prove disabling, surgery can be followed by postoperative radiation, although the role and efficacy of this are controversial. In locations where surgical extirpation is difficult or unfeasible, primary radiation, hormonal therapy, or chemotherapy should be considered. Familiar adenosis polyposis (FAP)-associated mesenteric lesions, sporadic tumors present without change for months or years, or tumors present in areas where progression will not present significant additional morbidity are candidates for observation only."

"Desmoplastic fibroma is a very rare primary tumor of bone, closely related to aggressive fibromatosis of soft tissue. Although considered a benign lesion, it is locally destructive, can extend into the soft tissues, and has a high rate of local recurrences after incomplete surgical excision. Recognition of this entity is important to ensure proper surgical treatment. According to the published data, the tumor is most common in the long tubular bones (56%), the mandible (26%), and the pelvis (14%). Rib involvement by desmoplastic fibroma is extremely rare, and to our knowledge, only 3 cases have been reported in the literature to date. We present the case of a desmoplastic fibroma in the rib of a 19-year-old man, adding a fourth case to the previously reported cases involving this unusual location. The clinical history and the radiological and pathologic findings are presented."
"Abnormal expression of the alphaE-catenin protein, a component of the E-cadherin/catenin cell adhesion complex, is frequently observed in human cancer cells. An inverse correlation between alphaE-catenin expression and tumor malignancy can be of prognostic value. Mutations of the alphaE-catenin gene, CTNNA1, were described in several human cancer cell lines and were found to result in aberrant cell adhesion. We have developed a polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism-based method for mutation analysis of this gene in human tumor DNA. This approach enabled us to identify several polymorphisms in a set of desmoid tumors, demonstrating that this method is suitable for alphaE-catenin mutational analysis. On the basis of our genomic characterization data, we found that the previously reported alternative splicing of the alphaE-catenin gene actually generates a frame-shift, resulting in a truncated alphaE-catenin protein. This finding is unlike the other alpha-catenin family members alphaN-catenin and vinculin, which show in-frame alternative inserts. Furthermore, real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis did not reveal relevant expression levels of this alternatively spliced alphaE-catenin variant neither in any human tissue or cell line tested, nor at any mouse developmental stage tested. Thus, contrary to previous notions, alternative splicing with in-frame insertion nearby the C-terminal end of the protein is not a general feature for all members of the alpha-catenin/vinculin family."
"sepsis after rejection (n = 14), respiratory failure (n = 8), sepsis (n = 6), multiple organ failure (n = 4), arterial graft infection (n = 3), aspergillosis (n = 2), post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease (n = 2), intracranial hemorrhage (n = 2), and fungemia, chronic rejection, graft vs. host disease, necrotizing enterocolitis, pancreatitis, pulmonary embolism, and viral encephalitis (n = 1 case of each). Intestinal transplantation can be a lifesaving alternative for patients with intestinal failure. The prognosis after intestinal transplantation is better when it is performed before the onset of liver failure. Rejection monitoring with zoom videoendoscopy and new immunosuppressive therapy with sirolimus, daclizumab, and campath-1H have contributed to the improvement in patient survival."
"Fibroproliferative processes are a group of disorders in which there is excessive proliferation of spindle (mesenchymal fibroblast-like) cells. They range from hypertrophic scars to neoplasms such as aggressive fibromatosis. Cells from these disorders share cytologic similarity with fibroblasts present during the proliferative phase of wound healing, suggesting that they represent a prolonged wounding response. A critical role for beta-catenin in mesenchymal cells in fibroproliferative processes is suggested by its high rate of somatic mutation in aggressive fibromatosis. Using a Tcf-reporter mouse we found that beta-catenin protein level and Tcf-transcriptional activity are elevated in fibroblasts during the proliferative phase of healing. We generated a transgenic mouse in which stabilized beta-catenin is expressed in mesenchymal cells under control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter. Fibroblasts from the transgenic mice exhibited increased proliferation, motility, and invasiveness when expressing stabilized beta-catenin and induced tumors after induction of the transgene when grafted into nude mice. Mice developed aggressive fibromatoses and hyperplastic gastrointestinal polyps after 3 months of transgene induction and healed with hyperplastic cutaneous wounds compared with control mice, which demonstrates an important function for beta-catenin in mesenchymal cells and shows a central role for beta-catenin in wound healing and fibroproliferative disorders."
"To describe an additional case of desmoid tumor of the penis. The incidence, etiopathogenesis, symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of this condition are discussed. METHODS: A 70-year-old male consulted at the emergency services for pain and urinary symptoms. Physical examination showed no regional lymphadenopathy. Patient assessment by ultrasound and CT disclosed a penile lesion. Treatment was by wide local excision. RESULTS: Control evaluation at 3, 6 and 12 months showed normal findings and the patient remains asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: Wide local excision is advocated as the treatment of choice for desmoid tumor of the penis."
"To investigate the role of radiation therapy (RT) in the management of desmoid tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed on 28 patients with desmoid tumors treated with radiation therapy between March 1989 and March 1999. Tumor site was intraabdominal in three, abdominal wall in three and extraabdominal in 22 patients. Median tumor dose was 48 Gy (range 36-60 Gy). Radiation therapy was delivered postoperatively in 26 of 28 patients, two patients received radiation therapy for unresectable recurrent tumors. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 46 months (range 13-108 months). Actuarial 5-year control rate was 73%. We observed six recurrences, located within the radiation field in one patient, out of field in two and at the field margin in three patients. All patients with intraabdominal tumors have been controlled without severe side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation therapy is an effective treatment after incomplete resection of desmoid tumors. We did not observe a benefit for tumor doses exceeding 50 Gy. In some patients with circumscribed intraabdominal desmoid tumors, radiation therapy might be a treatment option with low toxicity, if 3-D treatment planning is utilized."
"Desmoid tumors are rare connective tissue tumors, also referred to as deep, aggressive fibromatosis. Although histologically benign, they show an invasive growth behavior and have a high local recurrence rate. METHODS: The treatment of choice is surgical resection with wide negative margins, while the use of radiotherapy remains controversial. Wide resection of greater desmoid tumors may result in considerable defects and functional impairment. Few papers discuss different options for defect coverage after desmoid tumor resection. Two cases of extensive desmoid tumors, one at the trunk, one at the foot, both with compromised wound margins due to multiple previous surgeries, are presented. To achieve a stable and functional soft tissue cover, the defects were treated with microvascular soft tissue transfer (one free latissimus dorsi, one free radial forearm flap). RESULTS: Both flaps healed uneventfully and patients regained full function of the abdominal wall and foot, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The presented cases demonstrate the efficacy of free flap coverage as an ultimate therapeutic option in selected cases of critical defects after extra-abdominal desmoid tumor resection. Furthermore, free flaps provide a well vascularized ground for adjuvant radiotherapy."
"A case of an extra-abdominal desmoid tumor presenting as an intrathoracic tumor (intrathoracic desmoid tumor) in a 46-year-old woman is reported. The tumor originated in the left chest wall and protruded into the left pleural cavity. Simple resection was carried out. The tumor, measuring 13 x 9 x 7 cm, was solid, gray-tan in color, and covered with parietal pleura. Histologically, the tumor was composed of a hypocellular arrangement of spindle-shaped cells with a fibromyxoid background. In some areas, keloid-like hyalinized collagen fibers proliferated, and a perivascular hypercellular area was seen. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the cytoplasms of the tumor cells were strongly positive for vimentin, and some tumor cells were positive for alpha-smooth muscle actin, but all tumor cells were negative for CD34. These findings were consistent with the characteristics of an intrathoracic desmoid tumor. The differential diagnoses, in particular solitary fibrous tumor and tumors with a myofibroblastic nature, are discussed."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a rare, locally aggressive disease. It constitutes 0.3% of all solid tumors, but the tumor is rarely seen in the breast, particularly without pectoral muscle and fascial involvement. The etiology is unknown, but an association with Gardner's syndrome has been described. Clinical and imaging findings simulate breast carcinoma. A case in a 53-year-old female patient is reported."
"In order to evaluate prognostic factors in the long-term survival of desmoid tumour patients, analysis of clinicopathological, immunohistochemical and follow-up data was performed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1969 and 1998, 54 patients underwent resection of aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid) and 33 of them (10 patients with FAP and 23 sporadic) were followed-up with a median time of 130 months (range 10-355 months). Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis of the desmoid tumours using Ki-67 was performed. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, curative resection (R0) (p<0.001) and low proliferation of Ki-67 (p=0.002) were of significant positive prognostic value concerning disease-free survivaL R0 and absence of Ki-67 staining were significantly associated with each other (p=0.004). CONCLUSION: Ki-67 seems to serve as a predictive marker concerning disease-free survival of desmoid tumour patients. In patients presenting with Ki-67 positive desmoids, which are unlikely to be resected in a curative manner, alternative treatment (e.g. sulindac) may be preferable."
"Fibromatoses of the breast are nonmetastasizing tumors, but can be infiltrative and locally recurrent. Breast fibromatoses are rare, and their specific genetic alterations have not been elucidated. However, their occasional occurrence in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and their morphologic identification with other deep fibromatoses (desmoid tumors) suggest that alterations of the APC/beta-catenin pathway might be involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic and FAP-associated breast fibromatoses. We analyzed somatic beta-catenin and APC gene mutations in 33 breast fibromatoses (32 sporadic and 1 FAP-associated) using immunohistochemistry for beta-catenin, 5q allelic loss assays, and direct DNA sequencing for exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene and the mutation cluster region of the APC gene. Nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin was present in the stromal tumor cells in most (82%) cases but not in normal stroma or mammary epithelial cells. Somatic alterations of the APC/beta-catenin pathway were detected in 79% of breast fibromatoses, including activating beta-catenin gene mutations in 15 cases and somatic APC alterations (mutation or 5q allelic loss or both) in 11. These findings indicate that alterations of the APC/beta-catenin pathway with resultant nuclear translocation of beta-catenin are important in the pathogenesis of both sporadic and FAP-associated breast fibromatosis. The spectrum of beta-catenin and APC alterations is similar to that described for desmoid tumors of the abdomen, paraspinal region, and extremities."
"000 times more in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP, Gardner syndrome) compared to normal population. It has been shown in molecular genetic examinations, that different mutations of the APC gene are responsible for desmoid tumors in FAP. It means, that this disease is one of the extraintestinal manifestations of Gardner syndrome. This tumor has high recurrence rate and is growing rapidly, and as a result it is the second most common cause of death in FAP patients. That is why genetic examination for FAP patients is advised to decide if the patient has higher risk for desmoid formation. If the result of the genetic test is positive, it is advisable to try to slow the progression of polyposis with medical treatment, and so to delay the date of the colectomy because the surgical intervention--and connective tissue damage--can induce desmoid formation in these patients. At the same time it is reasonable to examine and regularly control patients with sporadic desmoid tumors searching for other manifestations of Gardner syndrome (colon, stomach and duodenum polyposis, tumor of papilla Vateri, retinopathy, etc.). Palliative surgery is not indicated in patients with inoperable intraabdominal desmoid tumors, because partial resections (R1, R2, debulking) result in further tumor progression. In these patients medical treatment (sulindac, tamoxifen), chemotherapy (doxorubicin, dacarbazin) and radiotherapy or combination of them can result tumor remission. We describe our three patients (an abdominal wall desmoid four years following Cesarean section; a desmoid tumor in the retroperitoneum and in the pelvis diagnosed three years after total colectomy; and a retroperitoneal and abdominal wall desmoid one year after total colectomy) and etiology, diagnosis and therapy of desmoid tumors are discussed."
"We screened for genetic alterations of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and beta-catenin genes in 17 frozen specimens from 12 cases of sporadic desmoid tumors and then subdivided these cases into two groups according to the results of mutational analysis. We further examined mRNA expression of beta-catenin and cyclin D1 by TaqMan PCR and compared the mRNA expression within both groups. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis followed by DNA direct sequencing revealed beta-catenin mutation in 3 of 12 cases (6 of 17 specimens), whereas no APC missense mutations in the mutation cluster region were found. TaqMan PCR revealed extremely higher mRNA expression of beta-catenin and cyclin D1 in desmoid tumors, compared with those of normal skeletal muscles. In the beta-catenin mutated group, cyclin D1 mRNA expression was significantly higher than that of the beta-catenin wild-type group (p = 0.0120, Mann-Whitney U test). In addition, in the beta-catenin mutated group, beta-catenin mRNA expression was also significantly higher than that of the beta-catenin wild-type group (p = 0.0036, Mann-Whitney U test). All cases of desmoid tumors showed detectable beta-catenin nuclear expression immunohistochemically. These results suggest that a continuously elevated beta-catenin protein level caused by the beta-catenin mutation itself may have a stronger power that can transactivate transcription in vivo. Furthermore, the results provide a possible association between higher beta-catenin mRNA expression and mutated beta-catenin in sporadic desmoid tumors. This may suggest that the beta-catenin gene may be up-regulated by mutated or continuously elevated beta-catenin protein, that is, the beta-catenin gene may also be one of the targeted genes in the APC-beta-catenin-Tcf pathway."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumor) of a peripheral nerve is a rarity. Isolated cases have been reported in which the tumor originated from neighboring structures and only secondarily invaded the nerves. The case described in this report is unusual because the tumor selectively invaded the patient's nerve fascicles, requiring removal and graft repair. The procedure was followed by an excellent clinical recovery and no recurrence as of the 6-year follow-up review."
"Fibromatosis (or desmoid tumor) is an infiltrative fibroblastic/myofibroblastic lesion presenting a moderate risk for local recurrence and no metastatic potential. Classically, these lesions are classified whether in abdominal or extra-abdominal sites, and may be multicentric or familial. Primary fibromatosis of the breast (PFB) is an uncommon lesion that shows histological similarities with abdominal fibromatosis (AF), and frequently poses difficulties in the differential diagnosis with other spindle cell tumors of the breast. It has been demonstrated that AF usually shows immunoreactivity for estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors; conversely, in most of the studies, the cells from PFB are consistently negative for both receptors. We report on a case of a 41-year-old female with two desmoid tumors, affecting the abdominal wall and the breast tissue. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous report in which hormonal receptors were evaluated in abdominal and mammary desmoid tumors in the same patient. We assessed the immunohistochemical expression of ER and PR in both lesions; while the AF showed immunoreactivity for both receptors, the cells from PFB were all negative. Although we have considered just this case, we still believe that these findings could support a distinctive etiopathogenesis of abdominal and mammary fibromatosis."
Desmoid tumors (DTs) are well-recognized extracolonic manifestations of familial adenomatous polyposis. Surgical trauma and hormonal changes during pregnancy have been proposed as etiologic factors. We present a case of a rapidly growing pelvic DT arising from a J-pouch in a 27-year-old pregnant woman status postcolectomy with ileoanal J pouch anastomosis. The tumor interfered with the normal maturation and delivery of the fetus as well as the patient's ability to void or defecate prompting surgical intervention with resection of the tumor and adjacent J pouch at 23 weeks gestation. There are no other reports in the literature of pelvic DT requiring resection during pregnancy. Pelvic DTs in this scenario are potentially fatal to both mother and fetus secondary to uncontrolled bleeding. Surgical intervention should be limited to resection of tumor and when necessary the ileal pouch to minimize bleeding complications.

"The present study provides evidence that the in vitro cultured fibroblast cell line from desmoid tumors differs from normal fibrobasts in its extracellular matrix (ECM) macromolecule composition and is modulated by treatment with toremifene, an antiestrogen that reduces tumor mass by an unknown mechanism. The results showed increased transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) production, TGF-beta1 mRNA expression, and TGF-beta1 receptor number in desmoid fibroblasts compared with normal cells. As desmoid fibroblasts did not produce tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) but were sensitive to it, which enhanced glycosaminoglycans (GAG) accumulation, we assessed the TGF-beta1 effects on TNF-alpha production by human monocytes. Our results showed TGF-beta1 significantly increased TNF-alpha secretion by monocytes. Toremifene mediated its effects in desmoid fibroblasts via an estrogen receptor-independent pathway. It inhibited GAG accumulation and the secretion of both latent and active forms of TGF-beta1 and had an inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha production by monocytes. Our results suggest that in reducing TGF-beta1 production by desmoid fibroblasts and TNF-alpha production by monocytes, toremifene may restore the balance between the two growth factors."
"Desmoid tumours exhibit fibroblastic proliferation and arise from fascial or musculoaponeurotic structures. Despite their benign microscopic appearance, and their negligible metastatic potential, the propensity of desmoid tumours for local infiltration is potentially significant in terms of deformity, morbidity and mortality due to pressure effects and obstruction of vital structures and organs. The rarity of desmoid tumours, coupled with the variability in their clinical course, renders these lesions a vexing entity, and makes demonstration of the efficacy of any specific intervention difficult. Failure to recognize the potential for malignant behaviour in this tumour renders desmoids susceptible to inadequate treatment. This distinct pathological entity is reviewed with a specific focus on aetiology and treatment."
"Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (KH) is an endothelial-derived spindle cell neoplasm often associated with Kasabach-Merritt syndrome. Most cases arise in infancy and childhood and are soft-tissue tumors. The tumor displays an appearance between capillary hemangioma and Kaposi's sarcoma. We report a case of KH in a 1-year-old girl involving a mass that showed abnormal enhancement of soft tissue superficial to the right temporal bone with partial destruction of the temporal bone, the temporomandibular joint, mandibular condyle, and occipital bone. The physical finding of a discolored mass led clinicians to consider a hemangiomatous lesion, whereas the radiological picture suggested a more aggressive diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma and aggressive fibromatosis."
"Desmoids of the abdominal wall are rare tumours with an incidence of 2-4 cases per million. From our experience which is reported here in detail (5 cases observed over the past 20 years), we draw the conclusion that the only completely reliable diagnosis is still histological, in spite of the use of ultrasound, CT scans and the new imaging possibilities afforded by NMR. After comprehensive excision of at least 2 cm of macroscopically healthy tissue from the tumour margins, reconstruction using prosthetic materials, such as Mersilene, PTFE or Prolene was performed. Neither radiotherapy nor chemotherapy were used, since there were doubts as to their usefulness. The functional and cosmetic results were satisfactory in all cases. Over follow-up periods ranging from 3 to 13 years, none of the patients has presented recurrences or incisional hernias."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a rare, benign tumour with a capacity for infiltration of surrounding structures and a propensity for local recurrence. The cornerstone of therapy is surgery, with various other treatment modalities having ill-defined roles. Assessment of the efficacy of these interventions is difficult. The natural history of the condition is variable and different treatment modalities are often used concurrently. Childhood cases pose particular management problems because of their tendency to occur in the head and neck region and the potential for treatment-related morbidity. Two children presented after surgery with recurrent disease threatening the airway. One remitted spontaneously and remains disease free at 20 years. The other achieved a complete remission with radiotherapy and toremifene. The role of non-surgical treatment, particularly radiotherapy, is reviewed."
"Our purpose is to focus attention on the cancer family history, coupled with an understanding of the natural history and extracolonic tumor spectrum of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), through a family study. This family report provides an example of how colorectal cancer (CRC) can be prevented by knowledgeable gastroenterologists and colorectal surgeons who educate and compassionately counsel members of high-risk families so that their compliance with diagnostic screening and, ultimately, with protection through prophylactic colectomy, is achieved. A working pedigree of this extended family was constructed through interviews with the proband, followed by questionnaires sent to all primary and secondary relatives. Appropriately signed permission forms enabled us to secure pertinent medical and pathology records in order to ensure accuracy of historical information. Integral extracolonic tumors included medulloblastoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, hepatoblastoma, and desmoid tumors. We conclude that, due in part to improved longevity as a result of being spared CRC, several family members have developed certain FAP integral extracolonic cancers."
"While major maxillofacial pathology in the young patient is relatively uncommon, non-malignant conditions may pose a significant treatment dilemma due to their aggressive or unpredictable behaviour. Several such diseases managed by the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Unit at the Royal Children's Hospital of Melbourne have been selected for review. Illustrative case reports to highlight the principles of management are presented."
"Fibromatosis of the breast is an uncommon disease, most often appearing as an aggressive lesion mimicking carcinoma on mammography. We describe, in an asymptomatic 40-year-old woman, an unusual imaging appearance of fibromatosis of the breast mimicking a benign lesion at mammographic and sonographic studies."
"Five cases of head and neck fibromatosis were analyzed. The imaging and pathologic findings, surgical management, and clinical outcome were discussed. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective study of 5 adult head and neck fibromatosis cases, evaluating long-term follow-up results of conservative treatment. RESULTS: The 5 patients (2 male and 3 female) ranged in age from 16 to 51 years. The lesion size ranged from 1 to 8 cm. Four cases had limited surgical resection; 1 case was followed only. One of the surgically treated cases had a recurrence that was irradiated. All patients were well for a follow-up period of 2 to 8 years. CONCLUSION: Aggressive excision of head and neck fibromatosis cannot be achieved easily. Vigilant follow-up with or without conservative surgical excision achieves good disease control. Low dose radiotherapy can be used for inoperable cases. SIGNIFICANCE: Judicious conservative treatment should be attempted for head and neck fibromatosis to achieve optimal functional preservation."
"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), the most common soft tissue sarcoma of childhood, displays a variety of histologic patterns. Immunohistochemistry is used extensively to distinguish RMS from its mimics. Myogenin and MyoD1, myogenic transcriptional regulatory proteins expressed early in skeletal muscle differentiation, are considered sensitive and specific markers for RMS and are more specific than desmin and muscle-specific actin and more sensitive than myoglobin. Previous studies have focused on expression of myogenin and MyoD1 in small round cell tumors. This study assesses myogenin and MyoD1 in rhabdomyosarcoma subtypes and spindle cell tumors considered in the differential diagnosis of RMS. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissue from 32 RMS, 107 non-RMS, and 11 benign skeletal muscle samples was stained for myogenin and MyoD1 with standard immunohistochemical techniques. Nuclear positivity was scored on a three-tiered scale. All RMSs expressed myogenin. Alveolar RMS (ARMS) showed strong nuclear staining, especially in tumor cells lining fibrous septae and perivascular regions. In cases with a subtle alveolar architecture on routinely stained sections, myogenin highlighted and enhanced visualization of the alveolar morphologic pattern. Embryonal RMSs (ERMSs) were more variable in myogenin staining pattern and intensity. No cases of nodular fasciitis, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, myofibrosarcoma, leiomyoma, leiomyosarcoma, or alveolar soft part sarcoma stained for myogenin. Focal nuclear reactivity was seen in desmoid (2 of 10), infantile myofibromatosis (2 of 10), synovial sarcoma (1 of 10), and infantile fibrosarcoma (2 of 10). Non-neoplastic skeletal muscle fiber nuclei stained positively for myogenin in both tumor-associated samples (25 of 40) and benign skeletal muscle samples (5 of 11). Although all RMSs were immunoreactive for MyoD1, cytoplasmic and nonspecific background staining and reactivity of nonmyoid tissues hindered its practical utility in paraffin-embedded samples in this study. Although myogenin is a highly sensitive and specific marker for RMS, it is rarely seen in other spindle cell soft tissue tumors. As previously reported, ARMS stained more strongly than ERMS. In contrast to previous studies, rare non-RMS (7 of 107) displayed focal nuclear reactivity, and entrapped atrophic or regenerative skeletal muscle fibers also stained positively. Although these are potential pitfalls in the interpretation of myogenin, careful attention to morphology and other features, to the relative paucity of myogenin-positive nuclei in non-RMS. and to the presence of entrapped muscle fibers should prevent incorrect interpretation. Because the extent of myogenin expression in RMS is much greater than in non-RMS, it is a very useful marker when interpreted in the context of other clinicopathologic data."
"Solitary fibrous tumor is a soft tissue neoplasm initially described in the pleura but subsequently reported in a wide variety of locations. The clinical behavior is usually benign, but the existence of aggressive cases has been documented both in the pleura and in extrapleural sites. In this report clinical and pathologic features of seven solitary fibrous tumors of the thyroid gland are presented. Patients' ages ranged from 43 to 64 years (mean 52 years), and tumor sizes varied from 2 to 6 cm. Grossly, the tumors were white-tan and well circumscribed. Microscopically, there was a variegated, wavy, storiform, hemangiopericytic or desmoid-like arrangement of spindle cells. Trapped thyroid follicles within the tumor and peripheral jagged tumor infiltration among follicles were common. There was immunohistochemical reactivity for CD34, CD99, and bcl-2, and ultrastructural analysis of one tumor was consistent with a fibroblastic lineage. The differential diagnosis included other benign and malignant mesenchymal tumors of the thyroid, spindle cell follicular adenoma, Riedel's thyroiditis, the spindle cell, and paucicellular variants of anaplastic carcinoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma with exuberant nodular fasciitis-like stroma, and the spindle epithelial tumor with thymus-like differentiation. The cumulative data of 13 cases (comprised of the seven present cases and the six previously reported) suggest a benign clinical behavior for thyroid SFT."
"Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is an uncommon mesenchymal neoplasm with a variable histologic appearance that may mimic other spindle cell processes, particularly nodular fasciitis, desmoid tumor, and in intra-abdominal locations, gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Recently, gene fusions involving ALK at chromosome 2p23 have been described in IMTs. The resultant ALK protein overexpression in the myofibroblastic component of these tumors is detectable by immunohistochemistry. We examined 73 IMTs, 20 cases of nodular fasciitis, 15 desmoid fibromatoses, and 15 gastrointestinal stromal tumors by immunohistochemistry using ALK-11, a rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes the C-terminus of the protein. ALK positivity was detected in 44 of 73 (60%) IMTs. All cases of nodular fasciitis, desmoid fibromatosis, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors were ALK negative (p < 0.001). These findings demonstrate that ALK positivity is common in IMTs, and immunohistochemistry using anti-ALK antibodies can be helpful in the differential diagnosis of these neoplasms. In addition, anti-ALK staining seems to correlate with those IMTs that have the typical tri-patterned histologic appearance and clinical presentation, providing additional support to the premise that IMT is a distinctive clinicopathologic entity within the broad category of inflammatory pseudotumors."
"We report on the resection of a large desmoid tumour of the anterior chest wall in a 65-year-old male patient. The patient had a coronary artery bypass operation 2 years prior to the first detection of a tumour. Because the left internal mammary artery bypass to the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was embedded in the tumour mass, it had to be resected together with the tumour. A saphenous vein aorto-coronary bypass to the LAD with an off-pump technique was then performed, and the chest was reconstructed with polypropylene mesh and a latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap."
"Desmoid tumours are histologically benign fibrous neoplasms arising from the musculoaponeurotic structures throughout the body. They are characterized as infiltrative, usually well-differentiated firm overgrowth of fibrous tissue and are locally aggressive. An aggressive clinical behaviour with tendency for recurrence makes the treatment of these relatively rare fibrous tumours difficult. Local recurrence rates are reported as high as 70 per cent of cases, the recurrence of desmoid fibromatosis in the head and neck is difficult to ascertain because of the different classification schemes used by different authors. A review of cases of desmoid tumours of the head and neck presented in the last 10 years is reported in this paper. Complete surgical excision of desmoid tumours is considered to be the only effective method of cure by most authorities."
"The immunohistochemical expression of beta-catenin, cyclin D1, Ki-67 and PCNA was Examined in 38 cases of sporadic extra-abdominal or abdominal-wall desmoid tumours without familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), to evaluate the hypothesis that the accumulated beta-catenin within the nuclei could affect the regulation of the cyclin D1 gene. There was a statistically significant correlation between beta-catenin accumulation and cyclin D1 overexpression (p=0.029). Each group with beta-catenin accumulation or cyclin D1 overexpression showed a higher PCNA-LI than those without, the difference being statistically significant (p=0.007, p=0.004, respectively). Differential PCR was also performed to detect amplification of the cyclin D1 gene and mutational analysis was undertaken for exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene. Amplification of the cyclin D1 gene was observed in 13 out of 22 cases (59.1%). There were nine-point mutations in 7 out of 18 cases (38.9%). The distribution of beta-catenin mutation fell within a wide range, from codon 21 to codon 67. In conclusion, beta-catenin nuclear expression correlated with cyclin D1 overexpression in sporadic desmoid tumours, which could be an in vivo model system for the APC-beta-catenin-Tcf pathway. In addition, beta-catenin mutations in desmoid tumours occurred at an unusually wide range of sites within the gene."
"Small intestinal neoplasms are uncommonly encountered in clinical practice. They may occur sporadically, in association with genetic diseases (e.g., familial adenomatous polyposis coli or Peutz-Jeghers syndrome), or in association with chronic intestinal inflammatory disorders (e.g., Crohn's disease or celiac sprue). Benign small intestinal tumors (e.g., leiomyoma, lipoma, hamartoma, or desmoid tumor) usually are asymptomatic but may present with intussusception. Primary malignancies of the small intestine-including adenocarcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, carcinoid, and lymphoma-may present with intestinal obstruction, jaundice, bleeding, or pain. Extraintestinal neoplasms may involve the intestine via contiguous spread or peritoneal metastasis. Hematogenous metastases to the intestine from an extraintestinal primary are unusual and are most typical of melanoma. Because the small intestine is relatively inaccessible to routine endoscopy, diagnosis of small intestinal neoplasms is often delayed for months after onset of symptoms. When the diagnosis is suspected, enteroclysis is the most useful imaging study. Small bowel endoscopy (enteroscopy) is increasingly widely available and may permit earlier, nonoperative diagnosis."
"This Phase II study was undertaken to assess the activity of methotrexate plus vinblastine in the treatment of patients with inoperable aggressive fibromatosis (AF) and to observe the evolution of the disease after such low-dose chemotherapy. METHODS: Thirty patients with a median age of 27 years who were affected by primary (20%) or recurrent (80%), advanced, inoperable AF were treated with weekly methotrexate at a dose of 30 mg/m(2) plus vinblastine at a dose of 6 mg/m(2) for a median interval of 1 year. Patients with recurrent disease had received surgery, radiotherapy, tamoxifen, and antracycline-based chemotherapy. Tumor response was assessed in all patients as well as time to disease progression. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (60%) showed stable disease or minor tumor shrinkage along with symptom relief. A partial response was detected in 12 patients (40%). No complete responses were observed, and no patients had tumor progression during treatment. Four patients received fewer than 15 cycles of chemotherapy, mainly because of severe myelotoxicity. One of these patients died of local disease progression 33 months later, and the other three patients were stable. After a median follow-up of 75 months, the 10-year actuarial progression free interval is 67%. CONCLUSIONS: Methotrexate plus vinblastine given every 7-10 days for several months is associated with prolonged stable disease in a substantial subset of patients with advanced (inoperable) aggressive fibromatosis."
The paper presents a case of 28-year-old woman operated at the Department of General Surgery University School of Medicine in Poznan because of desmoid tumor of rectus muscle of abdomen. The patient was incorrectly diagnosed a year earlier. The authors emphasize diagnostic problems leading to a delayed diagnosis.
"We report a patient with Gardner's syndrome who, in addition to a total colectomy, had multiple excisions of desmoid tumors in both thighs. He presented with left-sided neck swelling and pain. MRI was highly suggestive of desmoid tumors in multiple neck muscles. To our knowledge this is the first description of diffuse fibromatosis of the neck in association with Gardner's syndrome."
A 72-year-old man was hospitalized for further evaluation of a space-occupying lesion in the abdomen. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a tumor 40 mm in diameter in the abdomen. Anterior Ga-67 citrate scintigraphy revealed a region of accumulation of radioactivity in the abdomen corresponding to the tumor. Mesenteric desmoid was diagnosed on the basis of histological findings for the excised tumor. These finding suggested that mesenteric desmoid may be one of the tumors which show high uptake of Ga-67.

"Twenty pathologic fractures occurred in 285 patients with soft tissue tumors that were treated with radiation therapy and surgery. Twelve of these fractures occurred in 11 patients from a subpopulation of 163 patients with 168 soft tissue tumors of the thigh (155 soft tissue sarcomas and 13 aggressive fibromatosis). The fractures occurred at a mean of 40.5 months after treatment and were not associated with significant trauma. Risk factors associated with the development of fracture included tumor location within the anterior compartment of the thigh, extensive surgical periosteal stripping, and a marginal or intralesional margin of resection. The dose, timing, and fractionation of radiation therapy were not related to the risk of fracture. A high rate of complications was seen with this series, including fracture nonunion (45%) and deep infection (20%). Prophylactic intramedullary fixation of the femur should be considered for patients undergoing resection of large tumors in the anterior compartment of the thigh requiring extensive periosteal stripping and adjuvant radiation therapy."

"A case is described of an anterior chest wall desmoid tumor in a 20-year-old Micronesian male that had been previously incompletely resected one year prior to presentation. A radical chest wall resection was performed with reconstruction accomplished using a gortex patch and latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap. The patient developed a massive local recurrence within eight months following surgery. This report illustrates the local aggressiveness of these benign tumors. A historical perspective, etiology, and treatment principles are discussed."
"Whereas deep fibromatoses (abdominal, extra-abdominal, mesenteric) display locally aggressive behavior, superficial fibromatoses typically remain small and less likely to recur despite essentially identical morphology. Somatic beta-catenin or APC gene mutations have been reported in < or =74% of sporadic deep fibromatoses and in virtually 100% of Gardner syndrome-associated fibromatoses, whereas genetic events in superficial fibromatoses remain less well characterized. We performed immunohistochemical staining for beta-catenin on 29 superficial fibromatoses (22 palmar, 5 plantar, 1 penile, and 1 infantile digital fibromatosis) and 5 deep fibromatoses. Mutations of beta-catenin and APC genes were analyzed in cases of superficial fibromatoses by direct DNA sequencing of the beta-catenin gene on Exon 3 encompassing the GSK-3 36 phosphorylation region and of the APC gene on the mutation cluster region. Nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin was present in 86% (25/29) of superficial fibromatosis cases ranging from 5 to 100% of nuclei (mean, 13%; median, 10%), though in a minority of nuclei in most examples. Deep fibromatoses had 60 to 100% nuclear staining in all five cases. No somatic mutations of beta-catenin or APC genes were identified in any of the superficial fibromatoses. In contrast to deep fibromatoses, superficial fibromatoses lack beta-catenin and APC gene mutations; the significance of focal nuclear beta-catenin accumulation is unclear. This difference may account inpart for their divergent clinical manifestations despite their morphologic resemblance to deep fibromatoses."

Aggressive fibromatosis harbours mutations resulting in beta-catenin protein stabilization. Primary cell cultures demonstrate constitutive tcf activation in aggressive fibromatosis. Expression and co-immunoprecipitation studies suggest that beta-catenin binds and activates tcf-3 in this tumour. This is the first demonstration of tcf-3 activation by beta-catenin stabilization in a human neoplastic process.
Desmoid tumor or Aggressive Fibromatosis is rarely seen in the nasal cavity and are prone to recurrences. A patient with earlier history of excision was treated with repeat ergery employing the Weber-Ferguson incision followed by post-op radiotherapy.
"Most reported thoracic desmoid tumors originate from the chest wall. However, intrathoracic desmoid tumors are rare. The pathogenesis of these tumors is unclear but antecedent trauma and operation have been implicated. Desmoid tumors can present either with pain or be incidentally detected on radiographic studies. We describe the case of a 60-year-old woman with an intrathoracic desmoid detected on a routine screening chest roentgenogram who underwent complete surgical resection of the tumor."
"superficial and deep. The superficial fibromatoses are typically small, slow-growing lesions and include palmar fibromatosis, plantar fibromatosis, juvenile aponeurotic fibroma, and infantile digital fibroma. The deep fibromatoses are commonly large, may grow rapidly, and are more aggressive. They include infantile myofibromatosis, fibromatosis colli, extraabdominal desmoid tumor, and aggressive infantile fibromatosis. Radiographs typically reveal a nonspecific soft-tissue mass, and calcification is common only in juvenile aponeurotic fibroma. Advanced imaging (ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance [MR] imaging) demonstrates lesion extent. Involvement of adjacent structures is common, reflecting the infiltrative growth pattern often seen in these lesions. MR imaging may show characteristic features of prominent low to intermediate signal intensity and bands of low signal intensity representing highly collagenized tissue. However, fibromatoses with less collagen and more cellularity may have nonspecific high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Local recurrence is frequent after surgical resection due to the aggressive lesion growth. It is important for radiologists to recognize the imaging characteristics of musculoskeletal fibromatoses to help guide the often difficult and protracted therapy and management of these lesions."

"A retrospective study of primary chest wall tumors (PCWTs/CWTs) was conducted to review their clinical, radiological and pathological features, as well as the early and long-term results of surgical management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1986 through 1996, 41 patients (18/44% male, 23/56% female, aged 15-78 years) with PCWTs were treated in our department. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (nine male, 14 female, mean age 36 years) had a benign CWT: enchondroma, five patients; fibrous dysplasia, four patients; neurilemmoma, three patients; osteochondroma, two patients; granular cell tumor, two patients; fibroma, two patients; lipoma, two patients; fibrolipoma, one patient; eosinophilic granuloma, one patient; aneurysmal bone cyst, one patient. Eighteen patients (nine male, nine female, mean age 59 years) had a malignant CWT: plasmacytoma, five patients; chondrosarcoma, two patients; osteosarcoma, two patients; fibrosarcoma, two patients; desmoid tumor, two patients; leiomyosarcoma, one patient; malignant fibrous histiocytoma, one patient; tendon sheath sarcoma, one patient; hemangiosarcoma, one patient; neurinosarcoma, one patient. The ribs were involved in 21 patients, the sternum in five patients, and the soft tissue in 17 patients. Distinction between benign and malignant CWT was not possible using radiographic criteria alone, and diagnosis was always confirmed histologically. Surgical treatment consisted of wide resection in 29 patients (15 benign/14 malignant CWTs), with the use of synthetic mesh in five cases, and excisional or incisional biopsy in 12 patients. There was no perioperative mortality. Two patients with a benign CWT (fibroma, one patient; neurilemmoma, one patient) had a local recurrence at 13 and 26 months after resection, respectively, and underwent wide resection (recurrence rate 8.7%). Follow-up at 3-13 years revealed one non-tumor-related death in patients with benign CWT (overall mortality rate 4.3%) and no other local recurrence. The overall 5- and 10-year survival in patients with malignant CWT was 33.3%. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that all CWTs should be considered malignant until proven otherwise. Wide resection with tumor-free margins is required in order to provide the best chance for cure in both benign and malignant lesions."
"Resection of chest wall tumors is often indicated for palliation from pain or chronic ulceration. However, under various conditions, it may lead to lasting tumor control and substantial freedom of disease might be achieved. Therefore, the long-term survival after chest wall resection for primary and metastatic tumors and its relation to the underlying histology was analyzed. METHODS: The medical files of 82 consecutive patients with tumors of the chest wall operated between 1 January 1989 and 31 October 1998 were reviewed. Follow-up data were collected from the outpatient's clinic and house physicians, respectively. Complete excision was accomplished in 71 patients. In 19 patients, partial or complete resection of the sternum was performed. Twenty-eight patients underwent chest wall resection extending to intrathoracic structures (lung, diaphragm, pericardium). The following subgroups were defined according to the histology: (A), sarcoma (n=32); (B), breast cancer (n=22); (C), renal cell cancer (n=9); (D), other metastases (n=7); (E), miscellaneous (n=12). The survival probability was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method (SAS software system). RESULTS: One of 41 female patients died from postoperative complications on day 30 after resection of ulcerating breast cancer recurrence (hospital mortality, 1.2%). The median survival times in groups A-E were 27, 32, 19, 16 and 22 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Chest wall resection offers immediate relief in the case of severe pain and unpleasant sequelae of ulceration. Moreover, it contributes to substantial long-term survival. This, in particular, applies to local recurrence after breast cancer."
"Desmoid tumors of the chest wall are uncommon fibromatous tumors characterized by their local invasion and frequent recurrences. They are considered low-grade malignant sarcomas. We analyze our results and evaluate our experience in their surgical treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1980 and 1999, eight patients were operated in our service for desmoid tumors of the chest wall. There were five males and three females with a mean age of 32 years old (17-52 years). The diagnosis was established on the basis of clinical signs and imaging studies (Chest X-ray and computed tomography). Surgery was done by direct approach of the tumors. RESULTS: None of the patients had Gardner's syndrome. Complete resection was done in seven of the eight cases. Histology confirmed all cases. The follow-up ranged from 24 and 180 months, for a mean of 82 months. There was one death from cardiac and renal failure 3 months after a fifth resection associated with adjuvant radiation therapy. No other post-operative complications were observed. Recurrences occurred in 50% of cases, all treated by surgery, associated to radiotherapy in one case. CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment of primary desmoid tumors of the chest wall requires wide local resection. In cases of recurrences, multimodality therapies should be considered."
"Gardner syndrome (GS), caused by mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, is characterized by polyposis coli, osteomas, and various soft-tissue tumors. If undetected or untreated, virtually all patients develop colonic carcinoma at a young age. Early detection, while essential, can be difficult because of attenuated phenotypes or spontaneous mutations. We present the clinicopathologic features of 11 identical fibromatous lesions that we have termed Gardner-associated fibroma (GAF), which not only appear to be a part of the spectrum of lesions associated with GS but, in some cases, represent the sentinel event leading to its detection. The GAFs occurred in 11 patients (5 boys and 6 girls; age range, 3 months-14 years), were solitary (n = 7) or multiple (n = 4), and occurred in the superficial and deep soft tissues of the paraspinal region (n = 7), back (n = 3), face (n = 2), scalp (n = 2), chest wall (n = 2), thigh (n = 1), neck (n = 1), and flank (n = 1). Histologically, GAFs resemble nuchal-type fibromas (NFs), consisting of thick, haphazardly arranged collagen bundles between which are found occasional bland fibroblasts, and having margins that frequently engulf surrounding structures including adjacent fat, muscle and nerves. After surgical excision, four patients developed recurrences that were classic desmoid fibromatoses (DFs). In one patient with multiple GAFs, one lesion had the features of GAF and DF in the absence of surgical trauma. A family history of GS or polyposis (n = 6) or DF (n = 1) was known at the time of surgery in seven patients. In three patients, the diagnosis of GAF resulted in the diagnosis of unsuspected APC in older family members, with the detection of an occult colonic adenocarcinoma in one parent. In the family of the remaining patient, no stigmata of GS were present. Genetic analysis of this child was performed to investigate the presence of a spontaneous (new) mutation; however, no abnormalities were detected. The significance of GAF is that it serves as a sentinel event for identifying GS kindreds, including those with a high risk for the development of DF, and it may potentially identify children with spontaneous mutations of the APC gene. Because NFs and GAFs resemble one another, we suggest that a subset of NF occurring in multiple sites, unusual locations, or children may be GAF."
"To describe the clinical manifestations of latex allergy in otolaryngology patients. DESIGN: Descriptive case series. SETTING: Tertiary academic otolaryngology practice. PATIENTS: Otolaryngology patients with documented allergic reactions to latex during surgery and confirmatory laboratory test results for latex allergy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical description of latex reactions; identification of risk factors for latex allergy. RESULTS: We describe 3 patients, 2 children and 1 young adult, with severe latex allergy manifested by intraoperative cardiorespiratory changes and confirmed by positive latex-specific IgE test results. A 9-year-old boy with a tracheotomy and a history of multiple procedures for laryngeal stenosis developed a rash and unexplained bronchospasm during an open laryngeal procedure. Surgery was aborted, and subsequent surgery was performed uneventfully 4 weeks later using a latex-safe environment. A 13-year-old boy with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt had sudden unexplained arterial oxygen desaturation and a rash during laser endoscopy. He was then treated successfully using latex-safe protocols. A 23-year-old man with a parotid malignancy developed unexplained hypotension and ventilatory difficulties in the operating room during preparation for surgery. He responded to medical treatment for anaphylaxis. CONCLUSION: The otolaryngologist should share in the increased awareness of latex allergy. Our patients who have had multiple surgical procedures or who are exposed to latex on a long-term basis may be at increased risk. Latex allergy should be considered when unexplained cardiorespiratory compromise occurs during surgery."

"The purpose of this study was to determine if radiotherapy is a beneficial adjuvant treatment after desmoid tumor resection. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 54 patients who underwent surgery without prior radiation at our institution between 1982 and 1998 to remove a desmoid tumor. Thirty-five patients had adjuvant radiation therapy after surgery, and 19 patients had surgery alone without immediate postoperative radiation. Sixteen of the 35 patients who underwent immediate postoperative radiation treatment had at least one prior resection before reoperation at our institution. Recurrence was defined as radiographic increase in tumor size after treatment. Follow-up interval (mean 39 months) and duration of local control were measured from the date of surgery at our institution. Potential prognostic factors for time to tumor progression were analyzed. RESULTS: Adjuvant treatment with radiation was the only significant prognostic factor for local control. The five-year actuarial local control rate was 81% for the 35 patients who underwent radiation in addition to surgery, compared to 53% for the 19 patients who underwent surgery alone (p = 0.018). For the patients who did not receive adjuvant radiation, only younger age at the time of surgery was associated with increased risk of failure (p = 0.035). Gross or microscopic margin status and number of prior operations were not detected as prognostic for local failure. For patients who did receive postoperative radiation, only abdominal location was associated with increased risk of failure (p = 0.0097). CONCLUSION: Radiation treatment as an adjuvant to surgery improved local control over surgery alone. Multiple operations before adjuvant radiation did not decrease the probability of subsequent tumor control. Radiation should be considered as adjuvant therapy to surgery if repeated surgery for a recurrent tumor would be complicated by a significant risk of morbidity."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a locally invasive soft tissue lesion. Seventy-five per cent of cases harbor a somatic mutation in either the APC or beta-catenin genes, resulting in beta-catenin protein stabilization. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis that modulates the formation of colonic neoplasia, especially in cases due to mutations resulting in beta-catenin stabilization. Human aggressive fibromatoses and lesions from the Apc+/Apc1638N mouse (a murine model for Apc-driven fibromatosis) demonstrated elevated COX-2 levels. COX-2 blockade either by the selective agent DFU or by non-selective COX blocking agents results in reduced proliferation in human tumor cell cultures. Breeding mice with Cox-2-/- mice resulted in no difference in number of aggressive fibromatoses formed, but in a smaller tumor size, while there was a decrease in number of GI lesions by 50%. Mice fed various COX blocking agents also showed a decline in tumor size. COX-2 expression was regulated by tcf-dependent transcription in this lesion. COX-2 partially regulates proliferation due to beta-catenin stabilization in aggressive fibromatosis. Although COX blockade alone does not cause tumor regression, this data suggests that it may have a role as an adjuvant therapy to slow tumor growth in this lesion."

"Desmoid tumors and fibrosarcomas (FS) are part of a wide spectrum of disordered fibroblastic growth that display striking clinical and phenotypic differences. This study was designed to characterize molecular abnormalities that are associated with these differences and to determine their clinical relevance. A cohort of 24 desmoid tumors and 25 low-grade (LG) and 14 high-grade (HG) FS that were clinically and pathologically well characterized was analyzed for alterations in expression of Ki-67, Bcl-2, retinoblastoma gene product (pRB), and p53 by immunohistochemistry. LG-FS and HG-FS showed abnormal expression of Ki-67 (32 versus 86%), Bcl-2 (48 versus 57%), and pRB (56 versus 93%). In contrast, desmoid tumors showed a normal phenotype with these markers. p53 overexpression was identified in 20% of LG-FS and in 29% of HG-FS cases but only in 4% of desmoid tumors. There was an increasing trend in the proportion of abnormal expression of Ki-67, Bcl-2, pRB, and p53 with the increase of tumor aggressiveness from desmoid tumors to LG-FS to HG-FS. The molecular differences between tumor entities were highly statistically significant (P < 0.01). Significant associations between abnormal expression of pRB and recurrence-free survival of LG-FS patients (P = 0.05) and between Ki-67 overexpression and recurrence-free survival for tumors of >5 cm were observed (P = 0.02). The demonstrated differences of molecular alterations in HG-FS, LG-FS, and desmoids appear to be related to biological aggressiveness of such tumors, and they might be useful to differentiate between histologically similar cases of desmoid tumors and LG-FS. pRB and Ki-67 status may be useful to predict recurrence in certain subsets of patients."
We experienced a very rare case with fibromatoses of multicentric origin. One of the 2 intraabdominal fibromatoses showed a extremely rapid growing and another fibromatosis arising from the abdominal wall showed an invasive behavior. All lesions were diagnosed and resected simultaneously. This patient has been followed for 2 years postoperatively and no recurrent lesion has been detected so far.

"Tissue microarrays allow high-throughput molecular profiling of cancer specimens by immunohistochemistry. Phenotype information of sections from arrayed biopsies on a multitissue block needs to be representative of full sections, as protein expression varies throughout the entire tumor specimen. To validate the use of tissue microarrays for immunophenotyping, we studied a group of 59 fibroblastic tumors with variable protein expression patterns by immunohistochemistry for Ki-67, p53, and the retinoblastoma protein (pRB). Data on full tissue sections were compared to the results of one, two, and three 0.6-mm core biopsies per tumor on a tissue array. Ki-67 and p53 staining was read as two categories (positive or negative). Concordance for this staining between tissue arrays with triplicate cores per tumor and full sections were 96 and 98%, respectively. For pRB staining was read as three categories (high, moderate, or negative), where concordance was 91%. The use of three cores per tumor resulted in lower numbers of lost cases and lower nonconcordance with standard full sections as compared to one or two cores per tumor. Correlations between phenotypes and clinical outcome were not significantly different between full section and array-based analysis. Triplicate 0.6-mm core biopsies sampled on tissue arrays provide a reliable system for high-throughput expression profiling by immunohistochemistry when compared to standard full sections. Triplicate cores offer a higher rate of assessable cases and a lower rate of nonconcordant readings than one or two cores. Concordance of triplicate cores is high (96 to 98%) for two category distinction and decreases with the complexity of the phenotypes being analyzed (91%)."
"A prenatal tumor located in the lumbar paravertebral area was discovered during a routine ultrasound examination at 32 weeks of pregnancy and surgically removed at 4 months of life. The histopathological diagnosis was first suggested to be an infantile desmoid fibromatosis. The tumor karyotype showed a three-way translocation involving both chromosomes 2 and a chromosome 11, t(2;11;2)(p23;p15;q31). Fluorescence in situ hybridization with a probe flanking the ALK gene at 2p23 demonstrated a rearrangement, as previously described in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs). In light of the genetic analysis, the histopathological diagnosis was revised to IMT, although inflammatory cells were scarce. IMTs are pseudosarcomatous inflammatory lesions that primarily occur in the soft tissue and viscera of children and young adults. Our report describes for the first time the occurrence of IMT during prenatal life. The ALK rearrangement may represent the molecular definition of a subgroup of mesenchymal tumors, not always with complete morphological features of IMT, similar to the model of EWS rearrangement in the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors."
"Extraabdominal desmoid tumor is a locally aggressive tumor despite being histologically benign. To avoid local recurrence, it is important to preoperatively detect the exact localization and extension of the infiltrating or disseminating lesion in this tumor. We report a case of recurrent extraabdominal desmoid tumor, which arose in the posterior thigh region, detected with Tl-201 (Tl) scintigraphy. In this case, Tl accumulated in the small disseminating lesion and to the recurrent tumor. This lesion was not identified by palpation because of its small size, deep localization and absence of symptoms, although MR imaging, which was performed after the Tl scintigraphy, clearly showed the lesion. After tumor resection, Tl did not accumulate in any region. These results suggest that Tl scintigraphy may be useful, not only for the diagnosis of extraabdominal desmoid tumor, but also for the detection of the exact localization or extension of small infiltrating or disseminating lesions before treatment."

"This case report illustrates the presentation and management of an extra-abdominal desmoid tumour of the breast. A review of the literature describing the aetiology, pathology and risk of recurrence was undertaken to determine how current understanding of this rare tumour may affect the management of patients, should they require breast reconstruction after radical excision of the primary tumour. The natural progression of the disease is variable and there are no markers predictive of recurrence or regression. Primary lesions should be assessed with respect to their anatomical site of origin (i.e. whether they arise within the breast or invade the breast from the underlying musculo-aponeurotic tissue) and the extent of local invasion. Radical excision of the tumour with clear histological margins decreases the likelihood of recurrence. Tumours arising from the musculo-aponeurotic system have increased risks of recurrence and of developing multifocal primary tumours in specific anatomical territories. Local recurrences should be assessed for extent and anatomical distribution, and radical excision performed as for a primary tumour. Radiotherapy can be used as an alternative treatment if radical excision of a primary or recurrent tumour would cause severe functional loss or mutilation. Radiotherapy can be used for positive histological margins following tumour excision. There is a higher risk of recurrence in the first 3 years after primary excision, and breast reconstruction may be best delayed for this period. Surgical trauma has been implicated in the aetiology of recurrence and the patient should be informed of this prior to breast reconstruction."
"Desmoids represent the most important cause of death, after colorectal cancer, in patients affected with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an inherited disease due to mutations in the APC gene. The aims of our study were to estimate the risk of developing desmoids in FAP patients and to evaluate the association between desmoids and different risk factors. The occurrence of desmoids, colorectal cancer and other extra-colonic manifestations were assessed in 897 FAP patients, 653 of whom were also investigated for APC mutations. Odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed using an unconditional multiple logistic regression model. Desmoids developed in 107 patients (11.9%), with a cumulative risk of 20.6%. Females had a significantly higher risk than males (OR = 2.1; 95% CI 1.4-3.1). Family history of desmoids (OR = 8.75; 95% CI 5.66-13.51), osteomas (OR = 2.9; 95% CI 1.8-4.8) and epidermoid cysts (OR = 1.8; 95% CI 1.1-3.2) was also significantly associated with the occurrence of disease. Subjects with APC mutations beyond codon 1444 had a 12-fold increased risk, compared with patients with mutations located upstream. Mutations beyond codon 1309 conferred a 17-fold higher risk, compared with mutations upstream codon 452. Multivariate analysis identified as independent predictors mutation beyond codon 1444 (OR = 6.2; 95% CI 2.5-15.8), family history of desmoids (OR = 5.8; 95% CI 3.1-10.6), female gender (OR = 2.1; 95% CI 1.1-3.8) and the presence of osteomas (OR = 1.9; 95% CI 1.1-3.4). Our results indicate that integrating genetic and clinical data is helpful in defining subgroups of patients at higher risk for desmoids, who may benefit from specific prevention programs."
"Desmoid tumors associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are locally invasive. Often occurring in the mesentery of the intestine, they sometimes recur after resection. Complications can include intestinal failure and dependence on parenteral nutrition. We describe 9 patients who underwent intestinal transplantation for the treatment of desmoid tumors associated with FAP. METHODS: Records of patients undergoing intestinal transplantation for desmoid tumors at 2 transplant centers were reviewed for patient age, sex, type of graft, procedure date, tumor site, desmoid complications, medications, extracolonic manifestations, status at follow-up, and length of survival. RESULTS: Nine patients with FAP and intestinal failure caused by desmoid tumors were treated with isolated intestinal (n = 6), multivisceral (n = 2), or combined liver-intestinal transplantation (n = 1). Desmoid tumors recurred in the abdominal walls of 2 patients. Two patients died: one as a result of sepsis, the other because of a rupture of a mycotic aneurysm of the aortic anastomosis. One graft lost to severe rejection was replaced with a second intestinal graft. Eleven to 53 months after transplantation, 7 patients were alive, well, independent of parenteral treatment, and leading apparently normal lifestyles. CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation of the intestine alone or as part of a multivisceral transplantation may help rescue otherwise untreatable patients with complicated desmoid tumors."
"We report on a de novo desmoid tumor of the posterior mediastinum with transdiaphragmatic extension in a 40-year-old man. The tumor was inoperable because of its location and the invasion of adjacent structures. Although extremely rare, desmoid tumors of the posterior mediastinum should be considered in the differential diagnosis of posterior mediastinal masses."
"We report a case of a desmoid tumor which developed in the apex of the chest wall. A 18-year-old woman was admitted with left shoulder pain. Chest X-ray showed a mass shadow in the left upper lung field. Chest MRI demonstrated the mass infiltrated into the left brachial plexus. A desmoid tumor was suspected on percutaneous needle biopsy. Resection of the tumor was performed. The mass was 13 x 9 x 5 cm in size and diagnosed pathologically as desmoid tumor. Adjunctive postoperative radiation therapy of 60 Gy was done. Postoperative course was uneventful except motor disturbances of the left fingers. At 15 months postoperatively, there was no evidence of recurrence."
"We describe a case of aggressive fibromatosis of the larynx occurring in a 75-year-old man. The lesion manifested with voice hoarseness and swallowing difficulty. A computerized tomographic scan of the neck revealed distortion of the glottic profile. A malignant tumor was suspected. Although a laryngoscopy-driven biopsy was non-diagnostic, total laryngectomy was done, since the lesion was not deemed amenable to conservative therapy. Grossly, the glottic rim was infiltrated by a hard, grey-white tissue showing a tentacular outline. Tissue sections featured a moderately cellular lesion composed of spindle cells with bland, tapered nuclei, enmeshed in a variably collagenized ground substance. Delicate spindle cell fascicles surrounded the native submucosal seromucous glands and had invaded the thyroid cartilage and the thyroid gland as well. The spindle cells were immunopositive for actins and vimentin, and negative for keratins, epithelial membrane antigen, desmin, and S-100 protein. No further therapy was administered. Periodic follow-up visits were negative. The patient died 5 years after surgery of myocardial infarction with no clinical evidence of lesion recurrence. Based on the available literature, our data confirm that laryngeal fibromatosis in adult patients is a locally infiltrating and progressive disease. Total laryngectomy with clear margins is needed as to avoid the high risk of local recurrence."
"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant disorder which typically presents with colorectal cancer in early adult life secondary to extensive adenomatous polyps of the colon. Gardner's syndrome is a variant of FAP in which desmoid tumors, osteomas and pigmented retinal lesions occur together with intestinal manifestations. The APC gene (adenomatous polyposis coli) at 5q21 is a tumor suppressor gene which is mutant in FAP. PATIENT: A 36 year old woman presented with a history of polyposis ventriculi, ovarian desmoid cysts, and disseminated desmoid tumors. Her familial history was unremarkable. On admission she complained weight gain, secondary amenorrhea, and episodes of hypertension followed by paroxysmal headache. RESULTS: Elevated urinary free cortisol (878 microg/24h), suppressed basal ACTH (< 5 pg/ml) and insuppressible serum cortisol after low dose dexamethasone (189 ng/ml) revealed adrenal Cushing's syndrome. Abdominal NMR showed an adrenal mass two centimeter in diameter with inhomogeneous contrast enhancement. Unilateral adrenalectomy was performed and an adrenal adenoma was diagnosed by histological criteria. For mutational detection DNA from peripheral blood leucocytes was extracted. A protein truncation test was performed, which revealed a termination mutation between codon 1099 and 1623 of the APC gene. Direct sequencing showed a point mutation in exon 15 of the APC gene at position 1542 (CAG --> TAG). This region is known to be altered in patients with extraintestinal manifestation of FAP. CONCLUSION: In patients with Gardner's syndrome adrenal tumors leading to hormonal excess should be considered. Whether mutations in the APC gene have implications in sporadic adrenal tumorigenesis needs to be proven."
"Accumulation with bone scintigraphy using technetium-99m hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (99mTc-HMDP) in 68 cases with radiographically or pathologically verified soft tissue tumor was examined. Radiographical or histopathologic diagnoses of the 68 cases included; 14 lipomas, 11 liposarcomas, 11 neurinomas or neurofibromas, 6 malignant lymphomas, 5 malignant fibrous histiocytomas, 5 hemangioma, rhabdomyosarcomas, 2 Langerhans cell histiocytoses, 2 desmoid tumors and one each of neuroblastoma, hemangiopericytoma, angiomyxoma, plasmacytoma, liomyosarcoma, lymphangioma, fibrosarcoma, elastofibroma, synovial sarcoma, and ganglion. Thirty-seven (54%) showed positive accumulation and 31 were negative. One half of soft tissue tumors can be accumulated by 99mTc-HMDP."

"Aggressive fibromatosis is a rare soft tissue tumour with a high tendency to local recurrence. The patients often present with a deeply sited, firm mass with or without pain. Genetic, physical and endocrine factors seem to be important in the development of the disease. Patients with Gardner's syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis have a higher risk of developing aggressive fibromatosis and often develop tumours in the mesentery, retroperitoneally or in the abdominal wall. Infantile fibromatosis is a variant of aggressive fibromatosis. The standard treatment of aggressive fibromatosis is surgical resection with wide free margin, in some cases supplemented with radiotherapy. Chemotherapy and hormonal treatment of non-resectable tumours has been described without convincing results and more data from clinical studies are needed."
"Diagnostic imaging has determined clinical application depending on kind of pathology and anatomical localisation. This is a precise and fine instrument for monitoring effects of treatment in childhood malignant tumours. Authors demonstrate examples of cases in which diagnostic imaging was the only method which revealed a relapse in situ, progression during chemotherapy or clinically unsuspected dissemination of tumours after many years."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is characterized by locally aggressive proliferation of fibroblasts and occasionally occurs in the head and neck. Although the etiology of this disease is still controversial, recent studies have shown that high levels of growth factors are found in these lesions. This article reports a case of 51-year-old woman with aggressive fibromatosis in the neck and inguinal region bilaterally. Gastric fiberscopic examination revealed a complication of advanced gastric scirrhous carcinoma. There were remarkably high levels of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in the serum. Postmortem autopsy examination was performed and scattered gastric carcinoma cells were observed in the fibromatosis lesions. Immunohistological staining showed positive expression of bFGF in the fibromatoses and stomach. We concluded that this was a rare case in which bFGF and PDGF released from gastric carcinoma cells caused aggressive fibromatosis by promoting unregulated proliferation of fibroblasts and collagen production locally."
"The t(12;15)(p13;q25) translocation, a recurrent chromosomal abnormality of congenital fibrosarcoma, leads to the expression of a Tel-TrkC fusion transcript. To determine whether detection of the chimeric protein may be helpful for the diagnosis of congenital fibrosarcoma, immunohistochemistry was performed with an anti-TrkC antibody on 26 spindle cell tumours of newborn or young children (n=19) or adults (n=7). Four out of five congenital fibrosarcomas showed TrkC immunoreactivity with cytoplasmic paranuclear staining. However, TrkC immunoreactivity was not restricted to congenital fibrosarcoma and was observed in infantile myofibromatosis, congenital haemangiopericytoma, desmoid tumour, nodular fasciitis, fibrous hamartoma, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour, and adult fibrosarcoma. RT-PCR analysis was performed on nine cases, including four congenital fibrosarcomas, for which frozen material was available. Tel-TrkC transcripts were detected by RT-PCR in the four congenital fibrosarcomas analysed, but not in the five other spindle cell tumours. Furthermore, several Tel-TrkC transcripts encoding for kinase isoforms of the Tel-TrkC protein were detected in congenital fibrosarcoma and may be involved in oncogenesis. The reciprocal TrkC-Tel transcript was detected in only one congenital fibrosarcoma. While the detection of a Tel-TrkC fusion transcript is a recurrent feature of congenital fibrosarcoma, TrkC immunoreactivity does not appear specific for the diagnosis of fibromatous paediatric tumours."

"Desmoids are rare, locally aggressive but nonmetastasizing fibrous masses that occur sporadically and in association with familial adenomatous polyposis. Therapeutic options are limited, and there is reluctance to operate on mesenteric desmoids because of the risk of complications or recurrence. Consequently, there is an increasing reliance on alternative therapeutic modalities. Nonsurgical options are of variable efficacy, however, and surgery is still required for the complications of desmoids. Each of the last four patients with desmoids presenting to this unit has required life-saving surgery as a result of failure of nonsurgical treatments or the development of complications. METHODS: We present case reports of four consecutive patients with large mesenteric desmoid tumors requiring surgical management. RESULTS: All four patients had massive mesenteric desmoids. Three cases associated with familial adenomatous polyposis had developed their desmoids after colectomy while the sporadic desmoid had continued to grow rapidly after diagnosis at laparotomy. Sulindac and toremifene were unsuccessful in all cases and one patient with familial adenomatous polyposis suffered dramatic erosion of her desmoid through the abdominal wall during antisarcoma chemotherapy. Two others required emergency laparotomy for complications, and the sporadic case underwent elective resection for symptomatic relief. Three had complete excision of their desmoid, and all remained well with no recurrence at a median follow-up of 12 (range, 7-14) months. CONCLUSION: Despite the risks, there remains a role for surgery in the management of large mesenteric desmoids."
"Abdominal wall tumors, though clinically similar, have varying degrees of biological behavior. DESIGN: Retrospective review of prospective databases. SETTING: Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. PATIENTS: Eighty-five patients with abdominal wall soft tissue tumors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary endpoints included time to first local recurrence, distant metastases, and disease-related mortality. Survival analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method, and comparisons were made by log-rank analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-nine desmoids, 32 soft tissue sarcomas (STS), and 14 dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) underwent surgery directed at achieving margin-negative resection. Unlike DFSP, most STS (77%) and desmoids(87%) were deep lesions requiring full-thickness abdominal wall resection and mesh reconstruction. Median follow-up time was 53 months, 101 months, and 31 months, with 5-year local recurrence-free survival rates of 97%, 100%, and 75%, for desmoids, DFSP, and STS, respectively. Desmoid tumors resected with positive microscopic margins had higher local failure rates (68% [positive margin] vs 100% [negative margin] 5-yr local recurrence-free survival, P<.05). For STS, high grade, deep location, and size at or above 5 cm were adverse prognostic factors for disease-specific and distant recurrence-free survival (P<.05); patients experiencing local recurrence was associated with decreased 5-year relapse-free survival rates (87% [primary] vs 50% [local recurrence], P<.05). Characteristically, no DFSP or desmoid developed distant metastases. Soft tissue sarcomas had significantly lower relapse-free survival rates than DFSP or desmoids (P<.05). CONCLUSION: Abdominal wall tumors demonstrate a broad spectrum of biological behavior. Desmoids and DFSP are a local problem. High grade, size at or above 5 cm, and deep location predict distant failure and tumor-related mortality for patients with STS. Complete surgical resection is the recommended treatment approach to achieve local control. Stratification by prognostic factors will facilitate selection of patients with STS for adjuvant systemic therapies."
"Patients with a soft tissue malignancy involving the sciatic nerve who present with neurologic loss generally are advised to have an amputation. Twenty patients who underwent limb-sparing procedures with complete resection of the sciatic nerve as treatment for neurofibrosarcomas (12 patients), liposarcomas (four patients), malignant fibrous histiocytomas (two patients), recurrent desmoid tumor (one patient), and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (one patient) were reviewed retrospectively. The mean age of these nine women and 11 men at the time of surgery was 51 years (range, 28-84 years). The right sciatic nerve was affected in 12 patients. These tumors were large and high grade. A mean of 22 cm of the nerve had to be resected (range, 8-42 cm). Ten patients received preoperative radiotherapy and 16 patients had intraoperative or postoperative radiotherapy. At a mean followup of 35 months (range, 7-97 months), 14 of the 20 patients were alive. Two patients had local recurrences develop (10%), whereas 12 patients had distant metastases. The function of the 10 patients as assessed by the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score averaged 74%. Most patients indicated that walking in the house is not difficult, but walking is compromised as soon as an effort is needed. Four patients walk without a cane, four needed one cane, and two needed two canes. The patients experienced stiffness, a sense of numbness, and premature fatigue. The use of analgesics was infrequent. Generally, patients rated themselves to be mildly to moderately disabled. From this small number of patients, it is shown that a tumor involving the sciatic nerve can be treated by limb-sparing surgery, including complete nerve resection, as an alternative to hip disarticulation or hindquarter amputation because the limb salvage option provides an acceptable functional outcome."
"We report on two cases of myofibroblastoma (MFB) of the breast comprised predominantly of a mature fatty component, representing approximately three quarters of the entire tumour area. Both tumours consisted of a well-circumscribed lipomatous tumour mass containing dispersed nodular or irregularly shaped spindled cellular areas. The fatty component was represented exclusively by mature adipocytes, uniform in size and shape, lacking nuclear pleomorphism. The cellular areas contained spindly to oval cells with morphological and immunophenotypical features typical of MFB. The two components were so intimately admixed that a finger-like infiltrating growth pattern was apparent. The cases reported here as ""lipomatous MFB"" aim to clarify further the morphological spectrum of MFB of the breast. Lipomatous MFB may potentially mimic other benign or aggressive tumour-like lesions or even bland-looking malignant spindle cell tumours such as fibromatosis, nodular fasciitis, spindle cell lipoma, spindle cell liposarcoma, spindle cell variant of metaplastic carcinoma, spindle cell malignant myoepithelioma, and low-grade fibrosarcoma/malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The histogenesis of the present bimorphic mesenchymal tumours could be explained as the result of a dual, myofibroblastic and lipomatous, differentiation from a common pluripotential mesenchymal precursor cell, probably represented by the vimentin+/CD34+ fibroblast of the mammary stroma."

"We report on a case with desmoid tumor sucessfully treated with low-dose interferon alfa. A desmoid tumor was diagnosed in August 1998 in the right shoulder area of a 23-year-old woman. Surgery would probably have permanently impaired muscle function in her shoulder and arm. Therefore, interferon alfa treatment (0.9 million units twice daily subcutaneously) was started in November 1998 (time = 0). The tumor volume based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was initially 16 cm3. The size of the tumor decreased gradually during 12 months of treatment, and in November 1999 (time = 12 months) MRI showed no clear tumor demarcation. This treatment modality may be considered as an alternative to mutilating surgery in patients with desmoid tumor."
"Primary sarcomas involving the chest wall requiring full-thickness excision are rare. We reviewed our experience with these lesions in a tertiary referral cancer center by using multidisciplinary approaches. METHODS: A 10-year retrospective study identified 51 patients referred with primary sarcomas of the chest wall: 40 for initial treatment and 11 after previous unsuccessful surgical excisions elsewhere (secondary referral). Presenting symptoms were pain alone in 23 (45%) of 51 patients, pain with an associated mass in 8 (16%) patients, and an asymptomatic mass alone in 13 (25%) patients. Median symptom duration was 241 days in the primary group and 225 days in the recurrent group. Tumor locations were the sternum (n = 11), the rib alone (n = 36), and the posterior rib with extension into vertebral bodies (n = 4). Histologic types included the following: chondrosarcomas (n = 15), malignant fibrous histiocytomas (n = 9), osteosarcomas (n = 4), Ewing sarcomas (n = 3), desmoid tumors (n = 7), and other types (n = 13). The median tumor volume of those referred initially was 311 cm(3) compared with 84 cm(3) in patients with recurrent lesions. RESULTS: Twenty-six (51%) of 51 patients received treatment before resection, including chemotherapy alone (n = 22), radiation alone (n = 3), and combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy (n = 1). The complete sternum was removed in 6 of 11 patients, and the average number of ribs requiring resection was 3.8. Four patients had vertebral body resections. Prosthetic meshes alone were required in 16 of 51 patients, and meshes with methylmethacrylate were required in 18 of 51 patients. Muscle flap reconstructions by plastic surgery were required in 24 patients. Negative margins were obtained in 47 of 51 patients. There were no perioperative deaths with morbidities occurring in 12 (24%) of 51 patients (wound [n = 3], prolonged air leak [n = 1], prolonged ventilator requirement [n = 1], arrhythmias [n = 3], doxorubicin (Adriamycin)-induced cardiomyopathy [n = 1], and other [n = 3]). Postoperative treatment was administered to 13 patients (chemotherapy alone, n = 9; chemotherapy with radiation therapy, n = 4). The cumulative 5-year survival of all patients was 64% (initial referral, 61.3%; secondary referral, 72.7%). The average follow-up is 44.7 months. CONCLUSIONS: A combined aggressive multidisciplinary approach to primary sarcomas of the chest wall resulted in no treatment-related deaths and a cumulative 5-year survival of 64% in patients referred to our tertiary care cancer center."
"Most germline mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene result in a classic inherited cancer syndrome called familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). FAP is characterized by thousands of colonic polyps, well-defined extracolonic manifestations that may include pigmented lesions of the ocular fundus, supernumerary teeth, osteomas, odontomas, desmoid tumors and epidermoid cysts, and a 100% lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer. Shortly after the APC gene was cloned in 1991 (1,2) the molecular basis of an attenuated form of FAP was recognized to be related to germline mutations within APC that were most likely to be found in the 5' and 3' ends of the gene (3,4). The truncating mutations leading to classic FAP and attenuated FAP are quite rare, but recently a polymorphism of the APC gene was found among 6 to 7% of Ashkenazi Jews that approximately doubles the risk of colorectal cancer (5)."
"Desmoid tumors frequently reoccur after surgery and radiation. The therapy of recurrent desmoid tumors is often unsatisfactory. Additional surgery may not be feasible. Drug therapy can sometimes be helpful, and even remarkably successful. Unfortunately, the rarity of desmoids precludes conduct of large clinical trials. Most series are small, anecdotal, and lack internal consistency. The lack of real understanding of desmoid biology has meant that therapies have, until now, been empirical rather than rationally designed. Nevertheless, a range of drugs is available to be utilized, including hormonal or hormonal antagonist therapy, cyclooxygenase inhibitors, biologic agents and cytotoxic chemotherapy. This review will utilize a patient case report to illustrate the problems frequently encountered in choosing therapy for patients with recurrent desmoid tumors. Based on this case, the review will explore the options available, as well as the process through which treatment options may be evaluated."
"Plantar fibromatosis is a benign but sometimes locally aggressive proliferation of fibrous tissue that usually arises in adolescence or early adulthood. Pediatric presentation with asymptomatic, bilateral nodules on the anteromedial heel pad may be cause for cosmetic concern, but is otherwise harmless. Awareness and clinical diagnosis of benign anteromedial plantar nodules of childhood will prevent unnecessary and possibly unsuccessful surgery. We present a case of anteromedial plantar nodules and a brief review of the literature. We propose the term ""benign anteromedial plantar nodules of childhood"" to describe and define this clinically distinctive form of plantar fibromatosis."
"The aim of this study was to establish the length of telomeres in familial adenomatous polyposis-associated desmoids. METHODS: DNA from 21 desmoids and five desmoid precursor lesions was digested with HinfI and RsaI restriction enzymes. Southern blotting of the resolved fragments was performed, and the membranes were hybridized with a specific probe attached to a chemiluminescent substrate. Terminal restriction fragment lengths were measured. RESULTS: The median terminal restriction fragment length for the desmoids was 8 (range, 6-9.6) vs. 7.7 (range, 6.4-9.9) kb for their controls. Median terminal restriction fragment length for the desmoid precursor lesions was 9 (range, 7.8-10.4) vs. 8.8 (range, 6.8-10.9) kb for their controls. There was no statistically significant difference between samples and their controls. CONCLUSION: Immortality may not be necessary for desmoid development, or there may be other mechanisms maintaining telomere length. Novel treatments involving telomerase inhibition will be inappropriate in the management of desmoids."
"Desmoid tumors are are, nonmalignant neoplasms that show locally aggressive growth but lack the potential to metastasize. Common anatomic sites include the extremity, abdominal wall, and mesentery. Little is reported about clinical features and outcome of desmoid tumors of the head and neck. METHODS: Twenty-one patients with desmoid tumors of the head and neck treated at MSKCC between July 1982 and June 1999 were identified from our inpatient tumor database. All patients underwent surgical resection and were prospectively followed. Clinicopathologic features and treatment modalities were evaluated. RESULTS: Patient age at diagnosis was 22 to 76 years, with a female-male ratio of 16:5. Most tumors were located in the supraclavicular fossa or the muscles of the neck (n = 19). Patients most commonly had a painless mass (n = 13) or neurologic symptoms including pain or neurologic deficit (n = 8). Extent of resection was limited to the tumor in nine patients. In the other 12, structures including the accessory or phrenic nerve, parts of the brachial plexus, or bony structures were resected. Persistent neurologic or functional deficits after surgery were noted in 12 patients. Five of 21 patients had recurrences (24%). Eleven patients received radiation therapy. In this small population, no obvious benefit for patients receiving radiation vs patients who were not irradiated, regardless of their surgical margin status, was seen. Treatment for recurrence was re-resection or re-resection plus radiation. Eighteen patients remained free of disease after treatment, two patient have stable disease and one died of other causes. No patients died of their disease. CONCLUSIONS: Desmoid tumors of the head and neck are rare, fibrous neoplasms with a good prognosis but significant morbidity. Function-preserving surgery should be a primary goal to minimize morbidity. In this small group of patients, the benefits of radiation therapy in patients with positive margins could not be clearly demonstrated and should be balanced against radiation-related morbidity."
". In 8 patients there was good obstetrical history. Six of the 8 patients had a difficult delivery, as indicated by breech presentation or the need for forceps. Diagnostic aspirations were performed between the second to ninth week of age. The major cytologic finding was benign spindle fibroblasts, usually arrayed in clusters. The cells possessed plump, ovoid nuclei. There were also multinucleated cells consistent with degenerating skeletal muscle fibers. Only one case demonstrated significant inflammation. FNA can provide a rapid and reliable diagnosis in fibromatosis colli. There is support for the idea that in this setting, the disorder is related to perinatal muscular trauma."
"Tumors of fibrous origin include fibrous dysplasia (FD), fibroxanthoma (nonossifying fibroma), cortical desmoid, desmoplastic fibroma, fibrosarcoma, and malignant fibrous histiocytosis (MFH). Benign fibrous lesions (FD, fibroxanthoma, and cortical desmoid) frequently demonstrate pathognomonic radiologic characteristics obviating the need for biopsy. Indeed, biopsy of these lesions can occasionally lead to confusion with more aggressive lesions. Desmoplastic fibroma and the malignant fibrous lesions (fibrosarcoma and MFH) often reveal nonspecific imaging features of a solitary nonmineralized lesion with aggressive characteristics. However, imaging is important as with other neoplasms in delineating the extent of involvement for staging purposes. This article reviews the spectrum of clinical characteristics, pathology, imaging appearances, treatment, and prognosis of lesions of fibrous origin in bone."
"Desmoid tumors (DT) are rare benign tumors that do not metastasize, but tend to invade locally. DT are frequently seen in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), and diagnosis and treatment are often difficult. METHOD: The article presents the clinical picture, diagnosis and treatment of DT in patients registered in the Danish Polyposis Register by the end of 1999. RESULTS: Twenty-seven of 486 patients (6%) had DT. Eighteen patients were alive at the time of evaluation. DT were found in the mesentery in 42%, in the abdominal wall in 40%, in the retroperitoneum in 8% and only 10% on the extremities. Fifty percent of the patients had complications (intestinal obstruction, hydronephrosis or fistulas), and 2/9 deaths were caused by DT. Ninety-three percent were treated with surgery, NSAIDs, antioestogenic drugs, chemotherapy or radiotherapy, but all modalities proved disappointing, except for treatment with a combination of the NSAID sulindac and tamoxifen. Five patients treated with this combination showed extensive and long lasting response. DISCUSSION: Surgical excision is recommended in patients with DT in the abdominal wall. First line treatment of mesenteric DT is Clinoril in combination with tamoxifen. Elective surgery may be considered in patients with a small well-defined DT with no signs of invasion of vital structures, and in patients with imminent bowel ischaemia or obstruction. The prognosis for mesenteric DT is grave, and improvement of the therapeutic strategy awaits current international studies."
"The rare benign extra-abdominal desmoid tumor is characterized by aggressive invasion of normal tissue. Treatment is complicated by its recurrence, invasiveness, and persistence. The etiology is unknown and the pathophysiology is obscure. Because of exuberant fibroblastic proliferation with collagenous tissue being the primary tissue component, this desmoid tumor has been compared with keloids arising from excessive scar formation in healing wounds. Numerous cytokines are associated with signaling for growth and maintenance of mesenchymal cells. Altered expression of these proteins is associated with many pathologic conditions. It has been proposed that the enhanced expression of platelet-derived growth factor and its receptor characterize desmoid tumors. We tested the hypothesis that the exuberant fibrosis of desmoid tumors may have resulted from the initiation of the cascade of molecular events producing increased expression of cytokines. We used immunohistochemical analysis of cytokines in desmoid tumors compared with keloids and skin to localize the expression of cytokines. The results showed localized increased expression of the cytokines epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin-1beta, and interleukin-6 in the endothelial cells of blood vessels in the tumors. Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta in tumor tissue was increased, but we did not find increased expression of platelet-derived growth factor. We concluded that the increased expression of cytokines associated with angiogenesis usually found in wound healing and invasive tumors may contribute to the pathophysiology of the desmoid tumor."
"Whether fibromatoses are neoplastic or reactive lesions has long been controversial and the relationship, if any, between the superficial and deep forms (desmoid tumors) are poorly understood. Clinical, pathologic, and cytogenetic data of 78 cases of fibromatosis were analyzed and correlated with each other. The results demonstrate that clonal chromosome aberrations are a common feature of this entity, being present in 46% of desmoid tumors, although less frequent in the superficial types (10%). In the deep-seated extra-abdominal fibromatoses, trisomies 8 and 20 and loss of 5q material were the only recurrent features. No correlation between +8 and local recurrence was found. Our findings provide additional evidence for the neoplastic nature of fibromatoses."
"Extraabdominal desmoids represent one group of deep fibromatoses. These aggressive nonmetastasizing tumorlike lesions have a strong tendency to local infiltration, with a recurrence rate of about 40%. Trauma, hormones and heredity have been implicated as etiologic factors. Shoulder, chest wall, back and thigh are favored sites. By combination of different diagnostic procedures the number of differential diagnoses can be reduced to only a few. While in former times surgery was thought to be the only kind of therapy, nowadays adjuvant procedures like radiation, hormonal therapy and also chemotherapy are becoming more and more important. Amputation or other mutilating procedures should be done only if the tumor recurs repeatedly."
"Desmoid tumors (DTs) are rare nonmetastasizing neoplasms, occurring both sporadically and in the context of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). DTs show an unpredictable natural course with approximately 10% demonstrating a severely aggressive growth pattern, whereas others regress spontaneously. Surgery appears to have a triggering effect on desmoid growth, but is unavoidable in patients with FAP requiring prophylactic colectomy. Treatment recommendations remain controversial. Surgery may only be regarded as an option if a safety margin of at least 2 cm is guaranteed. Even under these circumstances recurrence rates are very high. Debulking operations invariably lead to a boost towards more aggressive growth. Most issues regarding DTs are contradictory, reflecting the lack of any systematic approach to the disease. One way out of this dilemma is the establishment of a clinical classification as a first step towards standardized therapy."

"The desmoid tumor of the breast with infiltrative and destructive growth tendencies is a rare benign lesion. Fibromatosis management favors wide local excision with clear margins, adjuvant hormonal- and radiotherapy can improve recurrence-free survival rate. We report on a patient with desmoid tumor of the breast."
"6 of 13 DSRCTs were informative by RT-PCR, and 6 of 6 showed an EWS-WT1 fusion; all 13 DSRCTs showed strong, definitive nuclear staining with the WT1 antibody. All 11 EWS/PNETs were WT1 antibody negative; 7 of 11 cases classified as EWS/PNET were informative by RT-PCR, and 7 of 7 showed an EWS-FLI-1 fusion. For cases in which the morphologic and immunohistochemical features are consistent with a diagnosis of DSRCT, WT1 antibody staining predicts the EWS-WT1 translocation with high sensitivity and specificity and is, therefore, useful for differentiating DSRCT from EWS/PNET when genetic information is unavailable."

"A recently proposed addition to fibrous tumors in soft tissue was first described as desmoplastic fibroblastoma and later renamed collagenous fibroma. This tumor is clinically and morphologically distinct and benign. However, only a few series have been reported, and the clinicopathologic features are not widely recognized. We present two cases of collagenous fibroma of the arm. Both patients presented with an enlarging, well-circumscribed and mobile soft tissue mass. Magnetic resonance imaging showed areas of low signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted sequences. Needle aspiration cytology revealed nondiagnostic samples because of the low cellularity of the tumors. Each of the resected tumors was composed of low-cellular spindle- to stellate-shaped cells in a fibrous matrix with clear margination. After the marginal excisions, no recurrences were observed. Clinicians should be aware of this entity to prevent overtreatment, because imaging findings and cytologic features are similar to those of desmoid tumor."
"Desmoid tumors developed on the toes of a young woman with idiopathic multicentric osteolysis (IMO) after amputation of the toenails. A summary of IMO is given, and a review of literature for the etiologic factors of desmoid tumors is added."
"Desmoid tumors are neoplasms characterized by proliferation of fibroblasts without cytologic features of malignancy. Although desmoid tumors are not uncommon, pelvic desmoid tumors are rare and therapeutically challenging. We describe the surgical management of seven patients with histologically confirmed desmoid tumors arising in the pelvis. STUDY DESIGN: All patients, six with primary and one with recurrent desmoid tumors of the female pelvis, were treated at Mayo Clinic Rochester between 1976 and 1997. The mean age of one African-American and six Caucasian patients was 29.8 years (range 17 to 59 years). No history of previous relevant pelvic trauma was identified; six patients experienced pelvic or leg pain (or both). All patients presented with isolated masses; five of seven were located left of the midline, generally involving the obturator internis or levator muscles (or both). The surgical approach was transabdominal, with a vaginal component in one patient. In addition to this retrospective review of these seven patients, literature addressing the management of desmoid tumors of the female pelvis is reviewed. RESULTS: Extirpative surgery necessitated resection of musculoskeletal, vascular, or adjacent soft tissue structures. Mean tumor diameter was 13.9cm (range 5 to 27 cm). Although the median recorded blood loss was 1,425mL, one patient who refused blood products died secondary to surgical hemorrhage. The median followup for the remaining evaluable patients was 57 months (range 13 to 249 months). Recurrent disease developed in 3 of 6 patients at 3, 11, and 13 months after surgical resection and was successfully managed with subsequent reoperations, with or without adjuvant radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Although recent reports demonstrate selective regression of desmoid tumors with antiestrogen therapy, management of symptomatic pelvic desmoid tumors in young women may necessitate an operation. In our series, all primary and recurrent tumors were managed with resection of involved bone and other adjacent soft tissues. The role of adjunctive radiotherapy or hormonal therapy remains to be defined."
"Six cases of aggressive fibromatosis occurring in the head and neck in children are described. Fibromatosis is a rare, benign but locally infiltrative condition. Primary excision is not always possible in the head and neck areas. It is not always appropriate to treat children using the same modalities as adults due to associated growth problems. The case histories illustrate the management difficulties that can be encountered when treating the paediatric population."
"Desmoids are uncommon proliferations of fibroblasts that occur with disproportionate frequency in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. They do not metastasize and are histologically benign. Despite this, the unpredictable and often aggressive nature of familial adenomatous polyposis-associated desmoids and their tendency to occur in intra-abdominal sites means that they present a difficult management problem, and they are a leading cause of death in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis who have undergone colectomy. We report a case of a patient with familial adenomatous polyposis who had extensive and aggressive desmoid disease and whose management was further complicated by a large intrahepatic desmoid. There are no previous reports of desmoids occurring in the liver."
"Congenital fibrosarcoma (CFS) is a pediatric spindle cell tumor of the soft tissues that usually presents before the age of 2 years. Although these tumors display histologic features of malignancy and frequently recur, they have a relatively good prognosis and only rarely metastasize. CFS must therefore be differentiated from more aggressive spindle cell sarcomas that occur during childhood, particularly adult-type fibrosarcoma (ATFS), which can have an identical morphology. CFS must also be distinguished from benign but cellular fibroblastic lesions of the same age group, including infantile fibromatosis (IFB) and myofibromatosis (MFB). Unfortunately, standard pathologic examination often does not differentiate CFS from these other conditions. The authors recently identified a novel chromosomal translocation in CFS, t(12;15)(p13;q25), which gives rise to an ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion. They subsequently developed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays that can detect ETV6-NTRK3 fusion transcripts in CFS frozen or paraffin-embedded tumor specimens. To confirm the use of this assay in the differential diagnosis of CFS, they have screened a larger series of childhood pediatric spindle cell lesions for ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusions, including 11 cases of CFS, 13 malignant spindle cell tumors (including ATFS), and 38 benign spindle cell tumors (including IFB and MFB). Of the 11 cases diagnosed as CFS, 10 showed the ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion, whereas none of the 51 other malignant or benign spindle cell tumors demonstrated this fusion gene. They also compared their RT-PCR findings with those of conventional cytogenetics and with immunohistochemical detection of the ETV6-NTRK3 protein using antisera to NTRK3. They conclude that RT-PCR analysis is superior to these techniques for the detection of the ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion in pediatric spindle cell tumors, and it is a reliable and specific modality for the diagnosis of CFS."
"To evaluate the CT findings of maxillofacial mass lesions in younger children and to discuss the effectiveness of CT in their differential diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CT findings of 17 patients (age range, 0 years 5 months to 3 years 3 months) with histopathologically proven maxillofacial mass lesions were retrospectively evaluated. About two-thirds (11/17) comprised congenital lesions or more common lesions in infancy or younger children. RESULTS: Hemangiomas, dermoid cysts and ranulas in this age group presented characteristic CT findings in common with those occurring in adults. Two invasive lesions (melanotic neuroectodermal tumor and aggressive fibromatosis) had irregular margins and the latter also showed aggressive bone destruction. Two angiomas had irregular margins. A fibrosarcoma showed expansile bone destruction but had a regular margin. CONCLUSION: CT was useful in demonstrating the extent of maxillofacial mass lesions in children and for surgical treatment planning. Although some invasive lesions could be correctly diagnosed on the basis of CT, its diagnostic value in differentiating malignant from benign maxillofacial lesions in younger children was limited."
"To retrospectively review the treatment and outcome of pediatric patients with desmoid tumor who received radiation therapy at a single institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen pediatric patients received radiation therapy for desmoid tumor at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital between 1962 and 1998. Only 2 of the patients reviewed received treatment prior to 1976. The median dose of external beam irradiation was 50 Gy. RESULTS: At the time of this report, 10 of 13 patients have had tumors that recurred after radiation therapy and 3 have died from their disease. One additional patient was harboring a recurrence, and 1 had not been followed long enough to suggest that the patient had achieved disease control. One patient remained locally controlled after radiation therapy with long-term follow-up (196 months). The median time to recurrence following radiation therapy was 19 months (range, 3-135 months). Eight of the 13 patients suffered substantial tumor and treatment-related morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Desmoid tumors in pediatric patients are locally aggressive tumors that are likely to recur after radiation therapy. Alternatives to radiation therapy should be sought for the treatment of these tumors, and efforts should focus on low-morbidity therapies aimed at inhibiting the growth of these unique tumors."

"One hundred three patients with extraabdominal desmoid tumor were treated between 1970 and 1996 at the authors' institution. Among these, 15 patients were lost to followup and five were excluded because they had less than 1-year followup. The remaining 83 patients were followed up for a mean of 11.2 years. Thirty-seven (44.6%) patients experienced local recurrence on average 1.8 years after treatment. There was no difference in the incidence of recurrence between the two groups treated with surgery only (45.3%) or with adjuvant radiation therapy administered after inadequate surgical resection of the tumor margins (41.2%). Recurrence was not related to age, gender, and site. None of the 83 patients died of the disease. For recurrent but stable lesions, clinical observation alone may be considered."

"Defects in APC and DNA mismatch repair genes are associated with a strong predisposition to colon cancer in humans, and numerous mouse strains with mutations in these genes have been generated. In this report we describe the phenotype of Min/+ Mlh1-/- mice. We find that these doubly mutant mice develop more than three times the number of intestinal adenomas compared to Min/+ Mlh1+/+ or +/- mice but that these tumors do not show advanced progression in terms of tumor size or histological appearance. Full length Apc protein was not detected in the tumor cells from Min/+ Mlh1-/- mice. Molecular analyses indicated that in many tumors from Min/+ Mlh1-/- mice, Apc was inactivated by intragenic mutation. Mlh1 deficiency in Min/+ mice also led to an increase in cystic intestinal crypt multiplicity as well as enhancing desmoid tumorigenesis and epidermoid cyst development. Thus, Mlh1 deficiency influences the somatic events involved in the development of most of the phenotypes associated with the Min mutation. Oncogene (2000)."
"The intra-abdominal desmoplastic small round cell tumor is a rare neoplasm. It usually occurs in young males and diffusely involves the peritoneum and pursues an aggressive clinical course. The present patient was a 15-year-old male who experienced abdominal pain and abdominal swelling. The patient was diagnosed with an intestinal myogenic sarcoma, and surgery for tumor resection was performed in June 1999. The tumor was a 20 x 15 x 15 cm well-defined mass in the peritoneum involving the transverse colon and stomach with peritoneal disseminations and splenic metastasis. Microscopic findings were well-defined nests composed of small round cells and separated by abundant desmoplastic stroma. Cytologically, the tumor cells consisted of small, round to oval cells with a scant amount of light blue cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for anti-epithelial membrane antigen, vimentin, desmin, neuron-specific enolase and WT1 protein antibodies. Similar pathologic features with other small round cell tumors may lead to differential diagnostic difficulties that require the application of ancillary diagnostic methods, such as immunohistochemistry and cytogenetic techniques."
"The EWS gene, a transcription factor of unknown function, is involved in chromosomal translocations associated with a wide variety of tumors, particularly small round blue cell tumors such as Ewing sarcoma. It has previously been reported that desmoplastic small round blue cell tumor (DSRBCT) frequently has an associated t(11;22) abnormality resulting from fusion of the EWS and WT-1 genes. PROCEDURE: We report a case of a small round blue cell tumor with characteristics of both Ewing sarcoma and DSRBCT with a t(11;22) translocation leading to fusion of the EWS and FLI1genes. RESULTS: The translocation point and fusion products were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and restriction fragment mapping of the products. CONCLUSIONS: The biphenotypic nature of this case and the apparent promiscuity of the EWS gene in tumor-associated translocations coupled with other reports of biphenotypic childhood sarcomas has potential implications for the relationship between small round blue cell tumors and the mechanism of EWS/FLI1 oncogenesis."
"A 3-year-old boy with desmoid-type infantile fibromatosis arose in the mandible was reported. He was referred to our hospital because of suspected malignant bone tumor of the mandible. Histological examination of an open biopsy specimen was performed followed by tumor resection with marginal mandibulectomy and reconstruction by iliac bone grafting, which caused no functional complications nor mandibular deformity. To treat tumors in the facial skeleton, the surgical procedure should be planned based on the histological diagnosis in order to determine the proper area of resection to prevent functional or cosmetic complications. Especially in children, attention should be taken for benign but clinically resembling malignant rare diseases such as desmoid-type infantile fibromatosis."

A new technique is described for treating a large cystic degeneration after regression of an intra-abdominal desmoid tumors in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. A cysto-peritoneal shunt is made for the relief of large cystic degeneration by creating a channel between the mesenteric cyst and the peritoneal cavity by means of a silicone tube to facilitate transperitoneal drainage.
"Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors are associated with familial adenomatous polyposis and may compromise ileoanal pouch function after restorative proctocolectomy, particularly if the pouch mesentery is involved. This usually necessitates pouch excision. The aim of this report was to describe the first known case of pouch salvage after surgery for a desmoid tumor arising from the pouch mesentery. METHODS: The management of a desmoid tumor involving an ileoanal pouch in a 21-year-old female is described and the literature reviewed. RESULTS: The tumor was successfully excised completely after failed medical therapy, and pouch function was fully preserved. CONCLUSIONS: This is a unique case highlighting the possibility of pouch salvage when affected by desmoid tumor."
"We report two cases of aggressive fibromatosis of the mediastinum with esophageal involvement in adults. CT showed the posterior mediastinal mass involving the esophagus. In both cases, surgical resection was not feasible. Histopathologic examination showed a fibrous tissue. The patients died two years later."
Desmoids are rare tumors originating from musculo-aponeurotic soft tissues. Their biologic features placed them between benign fibromas and malignant fibrosarcomas. The rare of parotid gland desmoid tumor is presented. The patient was treated surgically--the tumor was resected with the safety margins. Recurrence was not observed during 12 month follow up.

"We present a mesenteric desmoid tumor in a man without associated diseases. Characteristics of this tumor are reviewed and the need to perform total exeresis of the mass for diagnosis is emphasized. Although surgery is the treatment of choice, alternative treatments are recommended when surgery cannot be performed, has been incomplete, or in cases of repeated recurrence."
"Intra-abdominal desmoids are uncommon neoplasms. The aggressive nature of these tumours and the potential for major morbidity secondary to resection can present a difficult surgical dilemma. METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed intra-abdominal desmoid tumours undergoing laparotomy were identified from a prospective database. Clinical features and outcomes in this group were evaluated. RESULTS: The study group comprised 24 patients. Sixteen patients underwent complete resection of the tumour while eight had biopsy only, with or without intestinal bypass. Small intestinal resection was performed in 12 patients, including three who had a near-total enterectomy. Median follow-up was 62 months, with an actuarial overall survival rate of 73 per cent at 10 years. There was no difference in survival rate between completely resected and unresected patients (P = 0.73). There were seven deaths in the entire group, of which four were in those undergoing complete resection. CONCLUSION: Operation can cure patients with intra-abdominal desmoid tumours, but may result in significant morbidity, especially from loss of small intestine. No other therapy is a predictably good alternative to operation but the natural history of desmoids is often characterized by prolonged periods of stability or even regression. A period of watchful waiting, until significant symptoms develop, may be the most appropriate course in patients who risk mesenteric vascular injury or substantial enterectomy with attempts at resection."

"Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors occur in 12 percent of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. A minority grow quickly and are lethal, most are relatively inert, and some cause problems by obstructing adjacent organs. Desmoid tumors may be estrogen-dependent, and estrogen-blocking drugs are part of the usual treatment of these tumors. This study was performed to examine the effect of pregnancy on the course of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and intra-abdominal desmoids. METHODS: All females with familial adenomatous polyposis and an intra-abdominal desmoid treated or followed up at this institution were eligible. Stable, asymptomatic desmoids were followed up yearly with examination and CT scan. Growing or symptomatic desmoids were followed up at least every six months. Maximum tumor size was grouped as follows: <10 cm, 10 to 20 cm, and >20 cm. A change in tumor size was defined as a change of +/-50 percent or more of maximum diameter. Stable tumors showed no change in diameter during the study period; variable growth was defined as a significant change in either direction that was followed by a return to previous dimensions or a stabilization of growth. Rapid growth was a doubling of diameter within three months. Pregnant females were compared with nonpregnant females. Subgroups of females were matched for age at diagnosis of desmoid. RESULTS: Twenty-two females had never been pregnant, whereas 25 had been pregnant at least once. Eleven pairs were matched for age. There were no differences between groups in the incidence of extracolonic manifestations of familial adenomatous polyposis, family history of desmoids, number or type of surgeries done for familial adenomatous polyposis, length of follow-up, or time from surgery to desmoid diagnosis. Desmoids in pregnant females had a significantly more benign course: 18 were stable (vs. 6 nonpregnant females), 2 had variable growth (vs. 10), 1 had rapid growth (vs. 5), and 4 disappeared (vs. 1). There were also trends to smaller, less symptomatic tumors requiring treatment less often in pregnant females. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy seems to ameliorate the course of abdominal desmoid tumors significantly in females with familial adenomatous polyposis. This finding raises questions about the most appropriate hormonal treatment for these tumors. Perhaps progesterone or prolactin therapy should be tried, alone or in combination with estrogen. If further studies confirm these findings, females with a family history of desmoid tumors should not be advised against pregnancy."
"1) one or a few desmoid tumors present predominantly in the abdominal wall or the abdomen; 2) a florid proliferation of tumors early in life, mostly near the axial skeleton or extremities. These different phenotypes have been associated with different sites of germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC gene). We present a large, French-Canadian kindred with a florid desmoid tumor phenotype caused by a germline mutation at codon 2643-2644 of the APC gene. The phenotype was characterized by the early onset of multiple tumors, arising near the axial skeleton and in proximal extremities. The penetrance of desmoid tumors was near 100% in this kindred. However, the expression of the disease was variable amongst the different affected relatives. Many gene carriers had cutaneous cysts. Polyposis of the colon was rarely observed in the affected individuals and we did not document upper gastro-intestinal polyps. The mutant APC allele did not express a stable truncated protein in vivo. Molecular analysis of the proband's tumor DNA revealed a somatic inactivating mutation of the wild-type allele. Immunohistochemistry on the tumor also demonstrated elevated levels of beta-catenin. The present study demonstrates that this extreme 3' APC mutation is associated with a severely penetrant desmoid phenotype and attenuated polyposis coli. It also suggests the involvement of the beta-catenin pathway in the development of desmoid tumors in FAP. The natural history of the disease is variable between individuals, and surgical interventions have to be timed appropriately due to the frequent recurrences."
"Extra-abdominal desmoid tumor of the hand is rare and only 10 cases have been described in the literature. We present a 14-year-old boy with a recurrent extra-abdominal desmoid tumor in the dorsal site of the right hand. MR image demonstrated the tumor in the third dorsal interosseous muscle, and adhered to the radial side of the forth metacarpal bone. The lesion revealed iso-signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high intensity on T2. We performed a marginal excision. Histological examination of the tumor showed proliferation of the fibroblastic cells with abundant collagen bundles. He developed local recurrence for the third time. The size of the third recurrent tumor has not been changed for 2 years and 3 months. Therefore, we have not performed any additional surgery. Since extensive resection markedly diminishes the function of the hand, we consider that a marginal surgical margin is acceptable for the quality of daily life of patients with a desmoid tumor of the hand."
"Fibromatosis (desmoid tumors) is a rare entity expressing a mesenchymatous proliferation. The breast is an exceptional localisation. The origin is either the gland itself or the breast is an extension of a desmoid tumor originating from the chest wall or shoulder. Etiology is still unknown. Clinical and radiological features mimic the breast carcinoma. Diagnosis is made by histological studies which show a benign structure contrasting with its aggressive potential. Surgery is the treatment of choice and consists of wide excision which can lead to mutilation. Hormonotherapy is used if surgery is too invasive. We report a case of a female patient aged 21 years who presented for a mammary fibromatosis, treated by a large surgical excision. Evolution was marked by the appearance of an other localisation in the contralateral breast."

"Hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion with tumor necrosis factor-alpha and melphalan was used as induction treatment in locally advanced extremity soft-tissue sarcomas for limb sparing surgery. The typical histopathological changes that occur in these tumoral masses are described in a series of 30 patients. METHODS: Fresh tumor specimens of 27 high grade extensive soft-tissue sarcomas and 3 recurrent desmoid tumors of the extremities were collected 6 to 8 weeks after hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion with tumor necrosis factor-alpha plus melphalan. The specimens were studied for surgical margins, extent and type of tumor necrosis, lymph node involvement, perineural and vascular invasion, and the effects on adjacent normal tissues such as nerves, muscles, and blood vessels. RESULTS: The typical histological changes were central cystic hemorrhagic necrosis with pericystic extensive fibrosis. Some nonspecific changes were noted in the soft tissues around the mass. In eight cases, more than 90% necrosis was found. In 17 cases, the extent of necrosis ranged between 60% and 90% (80%-90% in 4 of 17 cases). In five cases, less than 60% necrosis was noted. The best responses (>90% necrosis) were observed in distally located tumors. The responsive types were malignant fibrous histiocytoma, followed by myxoid liposarcoma and synovial sarcoma. Desmoid tumors showed less necrosis than high grade sarcomas. Vascular invasion was observed in two cases and intralesional venous thrombosis in one case. No perineural invasion or lymph nodes involvement were observed. The soft tissues adjacent to the tumor bed did not show major morphological changes. No correlation was found between the histological changes and each of the following: the anatomical (upper vs. lower limb) or compartmental location of the tumor; whether the tumor was primary or recurrent; and the types of previous treatment (systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy) and tumor size. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first serial histological description of the effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and melphalan administered via hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion on the tumoral masses of limb soft-tissue sarcomas. The small number of specimens and, especially, the variability of tumors preclude definite conclusions. Larger numbers and more homogeneity are needed in future studies."
Desmoid tumors are histologically benign fibrous neoplasms arising from the musculoaponeurotic structures throughout the body. There is similar biological behaviour between benign fibrous proliferations and fibrosarcoma. These neoplasms have the tendency to locally invade and erode adjacent muscular tissue and bone. Within the head and neck area they also tend to encase vital structures. We present a case of a 28-year-old white female with a five-month history of a painful mass in her left posterior cervical triangle who was treated by excisional biopsy of the lesion with preservation of the accessory nerve and post-operative radiation. The histopathologic characteristics of desmoid tumors and treatment of these lesions are also reviewed.
"We report a case of desmoid tumor in the submandibular region in an 18-month-old girl. Head and neck desmoid tumors are uncommon in children and diagnosis is a difficult task because the tumors are often classified as different types of fibromatosis. This histologically benign affection is characterized by local expansion or destruction and tends to recur. Pathology gives the positive diagnosis, showing fibroblastic monoclonal proliferation between the cellular center and the collagen periphery. Electron microscopy evidences an abundant collagen network enclosing a polymorphous cellular proliferation. Immunohistochemistry defines vimentin and actin positive desmoid tumors. Surgery is usually the therapeutic choice. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be used in conjunction with surgery in situations of recurrence or unsatisfactory surgical margin. There is a risk of recurrence which can be detected with regular follow-up examinations."
"To elaborate a therapeutic scheme for desmoid tumors developing within the mesenteric root. These uncommon and often unrecognized tumors are difficult to treat as they lie very close to the superior mesenteric vessels. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 14 cases treated in our center over the last 20 years and a review of the literature. RESULTS: The analysis led to the development of a therapeutic scheme. Patients are placed under regular surveillance to detect any progression of the mesenteric root desmoid tumor. In case of progression, surgery should be proposed as often as possible in spite of the real difficulty of this surgery. When the tumor is unresectable, hormone therapy, sulindac, chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be proposed as appropriate. CONCLUSION: Based on the available literature, the proposed decisional tree is a helpful management tool. This scheme should be validated with the help of a National Observatory focusing on this rare disease."
"Desmoid tumors (aggressive fibromatoses) are benign neoplasms with high rates of recurrence after surgery. Radiotherapy is sometimes reported to prevent recurrences, but not in all studies. In order to evaluate the effect of radiation, comparative analysis was performed. METHODS: The authors conducted a MEDLINE search and collected all articles in the English language on the treatment of ""desmoid tumor"" or ""aggressive fibromatosis"" from the years 1983-1998. They categorized treatment into three groups: surgery alone (S), surgery with radiotherapy (S + RT), or radiotherapy alone (RT). The S and S + RT groups were each subdivided according to whether margins were free (-), positive (+), or unknown. Each subgroup was divided into cases with primary, recurrent, or unknown tumor. RESULTS: The local control rates after treatment for cases in the S group with (-) margins, (+) margins, and overall were 72%, 41%, and 61%, respectively. For the S + RT group the local control results were 94%, 75%, and 75%, respectively, significantly different when compared with the results for the S group. For the RT group, the local control was 78%, significantly superior to that of the S group (61%). Cases with primary and recurrent tumors had significantly superior local control rates with S + RT or RT versus S. Radiotherapy complications noted were fibrosis, paresthesias, edema, and fracture. CONCLUSIONS: RT or S + RT results in significantly better local control than S. Even after dividing the groups into cases with free and positive margins and cases with primary and recurrent tumors, the best local control is achieved with RT or S + RT."
"The aim of this retrospective study was to review the clinical features, and surgical and medical management of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis-associated desmoid tumors. METHODS: From 1980 to 1997, 97 of 780 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis developed desmoid disease. Clinical and demographic data; operative notes; and histologic, radiologic, and follow-up reports were retrieved from patients' medical records. Risk factors for desmoid disease, such as prior surgery, age at desmoid tumor diagnosis, pregnancy, and family history were sought. The outcome after noncytotoxic and cytotoxic therapy was evaluated with respect to improvement of symptoms. RESULTS: There were 38 males with a mean age of 32.1 years and 59 females with a mean age of 29.1 years. A family history of desmoid tumors was found in 41 patients (42 percent), and a history of pregnancy was documented in 33 females (56 percent). The most common clinical presentation was small-bowel obstruction (58 percent). One-half of the desmoids were located in the mesentery, and 32 percent were located in the mesentery and the abdominal wall. Desmoids developed after colectomy in 77 cases (80 percent), after a mean time of 4.6 years. Partial resection of desmoid tumor was performed in 46 patients (47 percent), resection of extra-abdominal desmoid tumors was performed in 17 cases (17 percent), and biopsy only was performed in 34 patients (35 percent). Postoperative morbidity was 23 percent after desmoid tumor resection. Eight patients (8 percent) died of their intra-abdominal desmoid. Mean follow-up time was 5.3 years. Sulindac, tamoxifen, or toremifene therapy was able to alleviate symptoms in only 4 of 31 patients. Symptomatic improvement was noted after chemotherapy in six of ten patients with extremely complex desmoids. CONCLUSION: Desmoid disease was found in 12.4 percent of our patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. In view of the high rate of morbidity, indication for surgery should be limited mainly to acute or chronic small-bowel obstruction, because resection triggers a high recurrence rate. Noncytotoxic therapy was not effective for progressive desmoid tumors, whereas chemotherapy was effective in aggressive cases of intra-abdominal desmoid tumors."
"Desmoids are poorly-understood, locally aggressive, non-metastasizing fibromatoses that occur with disproportionate frequency in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Their nature is controversial with arguments for and against a neoplastic origin. Neoplastic proliferations are by definition monoclonal, whereas reactive processes originate from a polyclonal background. We examined clonality of 25 samples of desmoid tissue from 11 female FAP patients by assessing patterns of X-chromosome inactivation to calculate a clonality ratio. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a polymorphic CAG short tandem repeat (STR) sequence adjacent to a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme site within the human androgen receptor (HUMARA) gene using fluorescent-labelled primers enabled analysis of PCR products by Applied Biosystems Genescan II software. Twenty-one samples from nine patients were informative for the assay. Samples from all informative cases comprised a median of 66% (range 0-75%) clonal cells but from the six patients with a clonality ratio < or =0.5 comprised a median of 71% (65-75%) clonal cells. FAP-associated desmoid tumours are true neoplasms. This may have implications in the development of improved treatment protocols for patients with these aggressive tumours."
Intrathoracic extension or primary thoracic origin of fibromatoses is distinctly uncommon. We describe the imaging features in three patients with this condition.
"The interaction between mutations in the tumor-suppressor genes Apc and p53 was studied in congenic mouse strains to minimize the influence of polymorphic modifiers. The multiplicity and invasiveness of intestinal adenomas of Apc(Min/+) (Min) mice was enhanced by deficiency for p53. In addition, the occurrence of desmoid fibromas was strongly enhanced by p53 deficiency. The genetic modifier Mom1 and the pharmacological agents piroxicam and difluoromethylornithine each reduced intestinal adenoma multiplicity in the absence of p53 function. Mom1 showed no influence on the development of desmoid fibromas, whereas the combination of piroxicam and difluoromethylornithine exerted a moderate effect. The ensemble of tumor suppressors and modifiers of a neoplastic process can be usefully analyzed in respect to tissue specificity and synergy."

"Reconstruction of massive abdominal wall defects has long been a vexing clinical problem. A landmark development for the autogenous tissue reconstruction of these difficult wounds was the introduction of ""components of anatomic separation"" technique by Ramirez et al. This method uses bilateral, innervated, bipedicle, rectus abdominis-transversus abdominis-internal oblique muscle flap complexes transposed medially to reconstruct the central abdominal wall. Enamored with this concept, this institution sought to define the limitations and complications and to quantify functional outcome with the use of this technique. During a 4-year period (July of 1991 to 1995), 22 patients underwent reconstruction of massive midline abdominal wounds. The defects varied in size from 6 to 14 cm in width and from 10 to 24 cm in height. Causes included removal of infected synthetic mesh material (n = 7), recurrent hernia (n = 4), removal of split-thickness skin graft and dense abdominal wall cicatrix (n = 4), parastomal hernia (n = 2), primary incisional hernia (n = 2), trauma/enteric sepsis (n = 2), and tumor resection (abdominal wall desmoid tumor involving the right rectus abdominis muscle) (n = 1). Twenty patients were treated with mobilization of both rectus abdominis muscles, and in two patients one muscle complex was used. The plane of ""separation"" was the interface between the external and internal oblique muscles. A quantitative dynamic assessment of the abdominal wall was performed in two patients by using a Cybex TEF machine, with analysis of truncal flexion strength being undertaken preoperatively and at 6 months after surgery. Patients achieved wound healing in all cases with one operation. Minor complications included superficial infection in two patients and a wound seroma in one. One patient developed a recurrent incisional hernia 8 months postoperatively. There was one postoperative death caused by multisystem organ failure. One patient required the addition of synthetic mesh to achieve abdominal closure. This case involved a thin patient whose defect exceeded 16 cm in width. There has been no clinically apparent muscle weakness in the abdomen over that present preoperatively. Analysis of preoperative and postoperative truncal force generation revealed a 40 percent increase in strength in the two patients tested on a Cybex machine. Reoperation was possible through the reconstructed abdominal wall in two patients without untoward sequela. This operation is an effective method for autogenous reconstruction of massive midline abdominal wall defects. It can be used either as a primary mode of defect closure or to treat the complications of trauma, surgery, or various diseases."
"A 39-year-old man was hospitalized because of continually rising urinary creatinine and blood urea nitrogen concentration. He was known to have familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), first diagnosed 18 years previously and re-Physical examination was unremarkable except for pain on percussion over both kidney regions. There was a well-healed laparotomy scar. INVESTIGATIONS: Ultrasound revealed chronic bilateral obstructive renal disease, grade II-III, and computed tomography showed a conglomerate retroperitoneal tumour with obstruction of both ureters at the level of the lower pelvis. This tumour had first been noted first 3 years after the colectomy when the patient complained of abdominal pain. It had been identified histologically as a nonresectable retroperitoneal desmoid tumour. TREATMENT AND COURSE: An external fistula was made, relieving the renal retention. To suppress growth of the desmoid tumour Sulindac, a nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug, was administered. Genetic molecular analysis revealed a germ line defect in codon 1690 of the APC gene. It is intended to examine other members of the family for the presence of this defect. CONCLUSION: Desmoid tumours are more common in persons with FAP and are among the most frequent extracolic causes of their death. Treatment options are critically analysed."
"Aggressive fibromatoses commonly originate from the musculoskeletal system, mesentery, and retroperitoneum. We report a case of aggressive fibromatosis arising from the spermatic cord. On helical computed tomography, the lesion appeared as a solid mass with well-defined borders in the scrotum and with infiltrative features in the retroperitoneum."
"Ag and S-100 protein. Ultrastructural findings showed oval nuclei with prominent nucleoli, rare intracytoplasmic mitochondria and well developed rough endoplasmic reticulum. According to histoimmunological and electron microscopy findings the proliferating cells were likely to be of fibroblastic origin. A 7-year follow-up showed a favourable clinical evolution thus confirming that surgical resection can be a sufficient therapeutic approach. The morphological findings and clinical behaviour suggest that more appropriate terminology for this tumour would be ""aggressive congenital fibromatosis"" which better highlights its local progressive invasion without metastases."
"The association of Turner's syndrome and endometrial carcinoma has been previously established, but has never been described in conjunction with a desmoid tumor of the colon. A case is described of a colonic desmoid tumor developing in a 38-year-old female with Turner's syndrome. The association has not been previously reported. In this report, we describe a 38-year-old woman who has Turner's syndrome with a colonic desmoid and review the literature."
"The authors report two cases of abdominal fibromatosis corresponding to Gardner's syndrome, causing hydronephrosis by extrinsic ureteric compression in young men in whom any form of surgical resection would have been in vain. These cases of ureteric compression were treated endoscopically by placement of a double J ureteric stent associated with treatment by tamoxifen in one case and sulindac in the other, with apparent stabilization of the disease. The two patients are regularly followed in the department with ureteric stent replacement two to three times a year."
"A 42 year old man without familial adenomatous polyposis had recurrent desmoid tumours in the left subclavicular site. Histological examination showed a typical desmoid tumour. Molecular analysis was performed in genomic DNA from this tumour, using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and direct sequencing methods. No mutation could be detected in the entire coding sequence of the APC gene, nor in H-ras, K-ras, N-ras, or p53 genes. On seeking a mutation of the beta catenin gene (CTNNB1), an activating mutation from ACC (Thr) to GCC (Ala) at codon 41 was found. Immunohistochemical staining showed that accumulated beta catenin protein was predominantly localised in the nuclei of desmoid cells. This is the first example of a sporadic desmoid tumour in which a mutation of the beta catenin gene was revealed."
"Surgery is the main treatment for extra-abdominal desmoid tumors, but the results of further management remain uncertain. Therefore, a retrospective analysis was undertaken to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of treatment with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) +/- tretinoin in this setting. METHODS: Thirteen patients with extra-abdominal desmoid tumors and a median age of 32 years (range, 15-73) received IFN-alpha. Seven of these patients received a combination of IFN-alpha and tretinoin in order to test further enhancement. RESULTS: After a mean observation period of 27 +/- 15 months (mean +/- standard deviation) under treatment with IFN-alpha +/- tretinoin, local control was seen in 11 of 13 patients (85%). Seven patients had no evidence of disease at a mean disease-free interval of 22 +/- 18 months; in two patients progressive disease occurred after only 7 and 9 months, respectively, of observation. In another four patients, progression of the desmoid tumor was stabilized. CONCLUSIONS: The data of this retrospective, nonrandomized study on therapy with IFN-alpha +/- tretinoin suggest that such treatment may be effective in prolonging the disease-free interval of patients after intralesional or marginal surgery. Because of the encouraging response rate, this regimen appears to be another nonsurgical treatment alternative."
"Desmoid tumours are rare lesions with a local invasive potential and a risk of recurrence, considered to be benign due to the absence of metastases. They are classified as fibromatoses and may be associated with Gardner's syndrome. The authors report an unusual case, in a 33-year-old woman, of a desmoid tumour invading the right ureter with upper tract dilatation. Etiologic factors (traumatic, hormonal, auto-immune...) are discussed, together with the treatment of choice to lower the risk of recurrence."
"Desmoids of the neck are histologically benign but locally aggressive fibrous tumours with a strong propensity to recur. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice, with patients requiring long-term follow-up. We present such a case and review the treatment of such tumours."

"Patients with recurrent, progressed or otherwise, therapy resistant malignancies, whose diseases are not amenable to standard therapies, may benefit from hyperthermia (HT). Based on the number of 1600 newly diagnosed malignancies, in patients < 15 years of age, per annum of which 70% are successfully treated on the standard treatment protocols of the German Society of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology (GPOH) and allowing for various drop-outs for reasons such as lack of established protocols, insufficient state of health and others, this means that as many as 100 children per annum can be expected to be enrolled into phase I/II trials in Germany. In view of the promising results in adults, phase I/II HT studies have also been performed in children and adolescents with recurrent or advanced malignancies including Ewing's tumours, aggressive fibromatosis, and germ cell tumours. Recent results in paediatric studies indicate the feasibility of both regional deep HT and whole body HT, and the best case analysis reveals promising response rates (CR + PR) as well as some long-term remissions. Technical modifications, due to the smaller body diameters, led to mean intratumoural temperatures in paediatric patients similar to those reported for adults in whom an improved outcome was demonstrated. The results in children and adolescents even suggest that introduction of HT into standard treatment protocols may be promising to improve tumour response and event-free survival in patients with poor risk malignancies of childhood."
"We report a case of a 3-year-old child with a desmoid tumour of the hand, which is an exceedingly rare location. Desmoid tumours of the hand are difficult to treat because of the many important structures concentrated in the area as well as the infiltrative and recurrent character of these tumours."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (also called desmoid tumor) occurs as a sporadic lesion or as part of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, which is caused by germ line mutations in the Adenomatous polyposis Coli (APC) gene. APC is involved in the regulation of the cellular level of beta-catenin, which is a mediator in Wnt signaling. Mutational analysis of the beta-catenin and APC genes was performed in 42 sporadic aggressive fibromatoses. Nine tumors had mutations in APC, and 22 had a point mutation in beta-catenin at either codon 45 or codon 41 (producing a stabilized beta-catenin protein product). Immunohistochemistry showed an elevated beta-catenin protein level in all tumors, regardless of mutational status. Beta-catenin localized to the nucleus, and was not tyrosine phosphorylated in the six tumors in which this was tested. The demonstration of mutations in two mediators in the Wnt-APC-beta-catenin pathway implicates beta-catenin stabilization as the key factor in the pathogenesis of aggressive fibromatosis. This is the first demonstration of somatic beta-catenin mutations in a locally invasive, but non metastatic lesion composed of spindle cells, illustrating the importance of beta-catenin stabilization in a variety of cell types and neoplastic processes. Moreover, this tumor has one of the highest reported frequencies of beta-catenin mutations of any tumor type."
"A series of 24 patients with desmoid tumours were studied to determine factors predicting local recurrence, and to establish whether these desmoid tumours were oestrogen receptor-positive or -negative. METHODS: Histology was reviewed and immunohistochemical studies were undertaken. Risk factors for local recurrence were analysed. RESULTS: The findings indicate that the 24 desmoid tumours were oestrogen receptor- and progesterone receptor-negative. Most tumours were proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive, and positivity was graded by percentage of cells staining and the intensity of the staining. The presence of incomplete macroscopic or histological surgical resection margins did not correlate with local recurrence. Although all tumours that recurred were strongly PCNA-positive with a high percentage of positive cell staining, this trend was not significant. Local recurrence was more common in desmoid tumours arising in extra-abdominal sites (P = 0.03). Extra-abdominal desmoid tumours were significantly more likely to have incomplete histological margins following resection (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Desmoid tumours are oestrogen receptor- and progesterone receptor-negative. Of factors analysed for local recurrence, only the extra-abdominal site was significant."

"We report, herein, on the first case of a mesenteric desmoid tumor with multiple peritoneal dissemination. A 73 year-old Japanese woman, who had a history of uterine cancer that was treated with hysterectomy followed by a high dose of irradiation 25 years ago, had an unknown stenosis of the sigmoid colon, which was treated with partial resection of the stenosed colon 6 years ago, and then resulted in multiple small bowel obstructions due to the recurrence of mesenteric desmoids. The clinical behavior of this tumor is considered to be unpredictable. We emphasize that mesenteric desmoid tumors should be considered as one of the causes of stenosis of the colon and small bowel, and patients should receive careful follow-up after unknown stenosis."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a rare fibroproliferative disorder with a variable biologic potential that is locally morbid but does not metastasize. Eighteen patients with extraabdominal fibromatosis were treated with a multidisciplinary approach over a 27-year period. Our observations, coupled with a review of the literature, suggest that conservative surgery with the goal of a wide margin coupled with adjuvant therapies may result in adequate control of disease from infancy to adolescence. Amputation should be reserved for cases in which the disease or its treatment have resulted in a nonfunctional or chronically painful extremity. Radiation should be used as a last resort in the skeletally immature because of the risk of growth disturbance, contracture, and secondary malignancy. Chemotherapy may have a role in children with inoperable disease, in those who have gross residual tumor after an intralesional procedure, for disease progression or recurrence, and neoadjuvant therapy should be investigated as a means to achieve a wide margin in some cases."
"The natural history of desmoid tumors remains an enigma. Previous reports attempting to identify their biology have included recurrent and primary tumors as well as tumors from both intra- and extra-abdominal sites. The purpose of this study was to analyze patients with primary extremity and trunk desmoid tumors treated and followed at a single institution and to determine factors influencing disease free survival. METHODS: Between July 1982 and June 1997, 189 patients with extremity and superficial trunk desmoid tumors were treated and followed prospectively. Of these, 105 presented with primary disease and formed the basis of this study. RESULTS: The median follow-up for the entire group of patients was 49 months; it was 46 months for patients who did not develop a local recurrence. During this time, 24 patients (23%) had a local recurrence. No patients died of disease. The 2-year and 5-year local recurrence free survival rates were 80% and 75%, respectively. None of the prognostic factors analyzed, including age, gender, depth of tumor, size of tumor, or tumor site, were significant for predicting local recurrence. Moreover, positive resection margins were not predictive of recurrence. The selective use of adjuvant radiation therapy did not influence the rate of local recurrence regardless of the margin status. CONCLUSIONS: Attempts to achieve negative resection margins may result in unnecessary morbidity and may not prevent local recurrence. Operations that preserve function and structure should be the primary goal, because the presence of residual disease cannot be clearly shown to impact adversely on 5-year disease free or overall survival."
"The management of extensive, recurrent limb desmoid tumors is extremely difficult. The failure of multimodality treatments, such as repeated resections, radiotherapy, systemic chemotherapy, or endocrine manipulations, can end up with multilating surgery or even amputation, similar problems sometimes encountered in soft tissue sarcoma of the limbs. The high rate of limb salvage achieved by isolated limb perfusion (ILP) with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and melphalan for extensive, high-grade soft tissue sarcoma led us to implement this modality in difficult cases of limb desmoids. METHODS: During a 4-year period, 6 patients aged 14 to 52 years were treated. All were significantly symptomatic and candidates for amputation or mutilating surgery. Five had lower and one had upper limb lesions. Two had multifocal disease. At ILP, 3 to 4 mg TNF and 1 to 1.5 mg/kg melphalan were delivered during a 90-minute period. One patient had a double perfusion. All patients underwent definitive resective operation 6 to 8 weeks after perfusion. RESULTS: No systemic complications were observed, and local complications included reversible skin redness and blisters. Response rate was 83% with 33% (2 of 6) complete response and 50% (3 of 6) partial response. In 1 patient less than 50% regression was observed. Limb salvage rate was 100%; even the patient with stabilization of disease could be locally resected. Local recurrence during a follow-up period of 7 to 55 months (median 45 months) occurred in 2 patients at 8 and 24 months, respectively; the first underwent amputation, whereas for the second a wide excision was possible. CONCLUSIONS: ILP with TNF and melphalan can be used as a limb preservation modality in patients with recurrent desmoids and significant symptoms who would otherwise require multilating surgery to control their neoplasm."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a rare benign soft tissue tumor that is difficult to cure because of its infiltrative nature and high tendency to recur locally. The authors retrospectively analyzed 20 patients with histologically-confirmed fibromatosis. All patients underwent surgery with a wide or marginal margin. Five (25%) cases with histologically-negative margins had recurred. External beam radiotherapy was administered to patients whose margins were positive or who had local recurrence. However, out of concern for safety, radiotherapy was not given to two babies and a reproductive-aged woman. The average dose was 5,020 cGy. During the follow-up (mean 32.6 months), all the patients undergoing radiotherapy showed no evidence of local recurrence. A wide local excision has traditionally been the treatment of choice. However, postoperative radiotherapy could be an effective measure for preventing local recurrence in patients with a histologically-positive surgical margin and recurrence independent of any signs of relapse."
"A typical case of desmoplastic small round cell tumour of the pleura in a 25-year-old man is described. In addition to the typical histological and immunohistological findings, the EWS-WT1 fusion product was also observed. Ultrastructurally, some tumour cells displayed intracytoplasmic neolumina, with short microvilli characteristic of submesothelial cells. These findings support the theory of a splanchnopleuric intraembryonic mesodermal, 'mesothelioblastemic' origin, both morphologically and cytogenetically."
"We described a case of Werner's syndrome associated with osteosarcoma. A 37-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed as having Werner's syndrome by the presence of juvenile cataracts, skin sclerosis and hyperpigmentation of the feet, high-pitched voice, characteristic bird-like appearance of the face with beak-shaped nose, thinning of the entire skin and hyperkeratoses on soles, hyperlipemia, hyperuricemia, diabetes melitus, and the mutated responsible gene (WRN). He had a 3-month history of a tumor on his left forearm. Histologically, the tumor included four histological patterns; a malignant fibrous histiocytoma-like, a desmoid-like, a dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans-like, and a chondrosarcoma-like pattern. Tumoral osteoid formation was also found in the tumor. Therefore, the tumor was diagnosed as osteosarcoma."
"Desmoid tumour (DT) is an uncommon locally invasive non-metastasizing neoplastic lesion. The aetiology of this tumour is unknown and its treatment is controversial. Twelve cases of DT are presented and the literature is reviewed. METHODS: Twelve cases of DT treated at our institution during a 3.5-year period are analysed and the literature reviewed. Ten patients were referred with a primary tumour, one with local recurrence and one patient with a second primary desmoid tumour. One patient had multiple mesenteric DT (familial adenomatous polyposis coli-FAP), and in the remaining 11 patients the tumour was located in the abdominal wall in four, at an extremity in three, in the upper back in two patients, in the pelvis in one and retroperitoneally in one. RESULTS: The largest mesenteric DT was marginally excised en bloc with total jejunectomy. In the remaining 11 DT, complete excision to microscopically tumour-free margins was possible in nine cases and to microscopically involved margins in two cases. At a mean follow-up of 22 months (range 7-38 months), one patient was alive with stable disease (Gardner's syndrome), 10 patients were alive and free of recurrence and one patient (9%) developed local recurrence which was re-excised-she is disease-free 10 months later. CONCLUSIONS: Complete excision is the main modality of treatment for primary and recurrent DT. This is feasible in most cases except for tumours involving the base of the bowel mesentery. Surgical resection alone achieved local control of the tumour in most of the patients in this series (92%)."
"We encountered a fatal case of mediastinal fibromatosis in a 67-year-old female in whom there was aggressive infiltration into the large vessels, nerves and pericardium. She presented with the superior vena cava syndrome, Horner's syndrome, paralysis of bilateral vocal cords and diaphragm and heart failure. Mediastinoscopical examination revealed an extremely firm tumor adhering to the sternum, trachea and brachiocephalic artery. She died of severe heart failure due to the disturbed dilatation of the heart and ventilatory insufficiency. Although mediastinal fibromatosis is very uncommon and sometimes difficult to diagnose at an early stage, physicians should be aware of this disease for the differential diagnosis of mediastinal tumors."
"Desmoid tumours are one of the most important and intriguing extracolonic manifestations of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). They have been studied only in small numbers of patients. METHODS: Patients with FAP who also had desmoid tumour were identified from a polyposis registry database and their hospital notes were reviewed. RESULTS: There were 166 desmoids in 88 patients (median age 32 (interquartile range 22-38) years; 51 (58 per cent) female); 83 tumours (50 per cent) were within the abdomen and 80 (48 per cent) were in the abdominal wall. All but 16 individuals (18 per cent) had already undergone abdominal surgery, which was significantly more recent in women (P = 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test). Intra-abdominal desmoids caused small bowel and ureteric obstruction and resulted in ten deaths; survival was significantly poorer than in patients with abdominal wall desmoid alone (chi2 = 3. 93, 1 d.f., P = 0.047, log rank test), and eight of 22 patients who underwent resection of intra-abdominal desmoid died in the perioperative period. CONCLUSION: Abdominal wall desmoids caused no deaths or significant morbidity; although recurrence was common after excision, the treatment was safe. Intra-abdominal desmoids can cause serious complications and treatment is often unsuccessful; in particular, surgery for desmoids at this site is hazardous."
"Desmoid tumors (DTs) are frequently associated with either surgical trauma, like scars, or physiologic trauma, like pregnancy. A DT arising in a cesarean scar during pregnancy shows both correlations. A case of DT that grew gradually in a cesarean scar during the first trimester of a subsequent pregnancy is presented. After initial MR imaging, the lesion was biopsied and carefully monitored; immediate surgical removal was considered at any time if indicated by the follow-up results. No increase in the tumor size was observed during the following 6 months of gestation, and the lesion was extirpated with mesh replacement of the abdominal defect at the time of cesarean section."
"The prognosis in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) has improved over the past decades owing to a reduction in the prevalence of colorectal cancer, resulting from effective early screening. During the same period several polyposis registers have recorded an increasing number of deaths due to duodenal/periampullary cancer and desmoid tumours. The aim of this study was to examine the causes of death with special emphasis on duodenal/periampullary cancer. METHODS: The material consisted of 328 patients (144 females and 184 males) registered from I January 1943 to 31 December 1992 in the Danish Polyposis Register. The standard mortality rate (SMR) was calculated for known major causes of death, using the entire Danish population as background population. The attributable risk was also calculated for selected death causes. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-three patients had died, SMR being 4.98 (95% confidence limits, 4.17-5.90). There were significantly lower SMRs in the call-up group than in the proband group. The late cohort (1943-1992) had lower SMRs than the early group (1889-1942). SMR was significantly increased for death due to colorectal cancer (145), duodenal cancer (214), and ovarian cancer (30). No deaths due to desmoids were observed in the examination period. The attributable risk for colorectal cancer was 29% and for duodenal cancer only 0.6%. CONCLUSION: Colorectal cancer is the most frequent cause of death in polyposis patients, followed by duodenal/periampullary cancer, but the latter is still a rare cause of death in FAP."
"Intramuscular desmoid tumors (musculoaponeurotic fibromatosis) were discovered in two young adult horses. The tumor in one horse was in the lateral cervical musculature, and that in the second horse occurred in the pectoral musculature. Histopathologic features were similar in both horses and included proliferation of fibroblasts and cells expressing muscle actin (myofibroblasts), with extensive dissecting fibrosis within muscle. These features are similar to those of desmoid tumors in humans, particularly those also known as musculoaponeurotic fibromatosis. Dissection of these lesions revealed a single central (horse No. 1) or multiple central (horse No. 2) fluid-filled cavities with associated sterile inflammation. The presence of these cavities supports the hypothesis that equine desmoid tumors are traumatic in origin, possibly occurring at sites of injections or bursal rupture. Surgical excision of the tumor in horse No. 1 was apparently curative, but the extent of the tumor in horse No. 2 precluded surgical excision."
"Desmoid tumors of the chest wall following chest surgery are a rare occurrence. A case of this disease is reported herein together with a review of the literature. A 74-year-old man, who had previously undergone a right lower lobectomy for squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, was referred to our hospital with an abnormal shadow on his chest X-ray. The tumor, located in the right lateral chest wall, was successfully resected by an aggressive, wide extirpation, and a final diagnosis of a desmoid tumor originating in the chest wall was made. When following up patients after surgery for lung cancer, the possibility of desmoid tumors developing in the incised chest wall should therefore be kept in mind."
"We report herein the case of a 27-year-old woman found to have an abdominal desmoid tumor involving the xyphoid and costal chondrium associated with pregnancy. The patient was referred to our department on the third day after delivery for investigation of a fist-sized, firm tumor in the infrasternal angle, first noticed during the eighth month of gestation. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a well-defined mass, 9 x 7.5 cm in size, invading the xyphoid. The tumor could be radically excised with the xyphoid, a lower part of sternum, and the chondrium of the bilateral sixth and seventh ribs, including 1.5 cm of free margin. The resected specimen measured 10 x 11.5 x 11.5 cm and weighed 395 g. Histological examination revealed the lesion to be a desmoid tumor consisting of spindle cells with small, elongated nuclei infiltrating dense collagenous fibers. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged on the 11th postoperative day. There has been no evidence of recurrence in the 6 months since her operation. This case is of interest with regard to the possible contribution of sex hormones, especially estrogen, to desmoid tumor development."
"Extraabdominal desmoid tumors are very rare; primary vulvar desmoid tumors are even rarer. CASE: A desmoid tumor involving the right labium majus, extending upward along the vaginal wall, was excised completely. CONCLUSION: These rare tumors, which may enlarge rapidly during pregnancy, are difficult to diagnose before surgery."
"In about one third of patients suffering from a desmoid tumor primary complete resection is not feasible. Furthermore in locally relapsing tumors reoperation alone does not result in cure in many cases. Radiotherapy can be applied in both groups of patients with curative intention. But the indication of radiotherapy is challenging particularly in children and adolescents due to the impending late radiation sequelae such as growth delay, fibrosis and radiation induced secondary malignancy. PATIENTS AND METHOD: The follow up and outcome of five irradiated children/adolescents with desmoid tumors, registered in the German-Cooperative-Soft-Tissue-Sarcoma Study (CWS) was looked at, and the corresponding literature was reviewed. RESULTS: Radiotherapy of gross residual or relapsing tumors resulted in long lasting event free survival in two cases (3/8 years), but in one patient local progression occurred despite irradiation. Postoperative radiotherapy in patients with microscopic residual disease resulted in both, long lasting event free survival (14 years, 1 patient) and in early local relapse (1.5 years, 1 patient). The role of radiotherapy could not be evaluated clearly by the CWS-experience due to the fact that the irradiated patients were treated individually also by chemotherapy and/or tamoxifen. But despite sparse and retrospective data there is evidence in the literature, that radiotherapy is able to control 65-90% of the unresectable desmoid tumors and that the local relapse rate can be reduced by radiotherapy by 10-20% in patients with microscopic residual disease following resection. CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy as primary treatment should be given if complete tumor resection is not feasible without mutilation. Radiotherapy can be applied postoperatively if the risk of local relapse seems to be highly life- or function threatening."
"Fibromatoses are a group of semimalignant tumors which grow infiltratively without metastases. If radical surgery is not at all possible or only by mutilation the question of neoadjuvant concepts arises. PATIENTS: We report on therapy and outcome of 36 patients registered to the German CWS study group and the Italian ICG study group for soft tissue sarcoma who were between 0 and 23 years of age. 15 had a histology of infantile (myo-) fibromatosis (9 unifocal, 6 multifocal). 15 patients had desmoid-like, aggressive fibromatosis. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the patients registered to the CWS and ICG study group. For literature review a medline search was performed. RESULTS: 23 patients received chemotherapy with anthracyclines (VAIA) or without (VAC) or monotherapy with alkylating agents. In 19 cases response to chemotherapy was measurable. In 9 patients tumors responded to chemotherapy. In some cases response was evident only after 20 weeks of treatment. In the group of non responders treatment was stopped early (after 4 weeks) in some cases. Relapses occurred mainly in the group of desmoid-like, aggressive fibromatosis (7 out of 15). In the group of infantile (myo-) fibromatosis only one patient suffered a relapse (1 out of 9). The literature review showed that mainly ADR/DTIC, VAC and MTX/VBL was used for inoperable fibromatoses. Concerning the response rates there where no major differences. Concerning toxicity the regimen with methotrexate and vinblastine seems superior to the others. CONCLUSIONS: As a chemotherapy regimen of first choice vinblastine with low dose methotrexate can be recommended. The therapy should not be stopped before the 20th week of treatment. The histological subgroup can provide good information on the relapse rate and aggressivity to be expected."
"if a broader spectrum of mutations is selected in tumors, the somatic mutation rate is effectively higher and more tumors grow."
"To evaluate the therapeutic value of resection and the potential benefits of and indications for adjuvant and definitive radiation therapy for desmoid tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 189 consecutive cases of desmoid tumor treated with surgical resection, resection and radiation therapy, or radiation therapy alone. Treatment was surgery alone in 122 cases, surgery and radiation therapy in 46, and radiation therapy alone in 21. Median follow-up was 9.4 years. RESULTS: Overall, 5- and 10-year actuarial relapse rates were 30% and 33%, respectively. Uncorrected survival rates were 96%, 92%, and 87% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. For the patients treated with surgery, the actuarial relapse rates were 34% and 38% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Among 78 patients with negative margins, the 10-year recurrence rate was 27%, whereas 40 margin-positive patients had a 10-year relapse rate of 54% (P = .003). Tumors located in an extremity also had a poorer prognosis than did those in the trunk. For patients treated with radiation therapy for gross disease, the 10-year actuarial relapse rate was 24%. For patients treated with combined resection and radiation therapy, the 10-year actuarial relapse rate was 25%. The addition of radiation therapy offset the adverse impact of positive margins seen in the surgical group. CONCLUSION: Wide local excision with negative pathologic margins is the treatment of choice for most desmoid tumors. Function-sparing resection is appropriate because adjuvant radiation therapy can offset the adverse impact of positive margins. Unresectable disease should be treated with definitive radiation therapy."
"The effect of the genetic background on the tumor spectrum of Apc1638N, a mouse model for attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), has been investigated in X-irradiated and untreated F1 hybrids between C57BL/6JIco-Apc1638N (B6) and A/JCrIBR (A/J), BALB/cByJIco (C) or C3H/HeOuJIco (C3). Similar to the ApcMin model, the Apc1638N intestinal tumor multiplicity seems to be modulated by Mom1. Moreover, several additional (X-ray-responsive) modifier loci appear also to affect the Apc1638N intestinal tumor number. The genetic background did not significantly influence the number of spontaneous desmoids and cutaneous cysts in Apc1638N. In general, X-irradiation increased the desmoid multiplicity in Apc1638N females but had no effect in males. The opposite was noted for the cyst multiplicity after X-rays. Surprisingly, X-irradiated CB6F1-Apc1638N females were highly susceptible to the development of ovarian tumors, which displayed clear loss of the wild-type Apc allele."
"Desmoid tumors are rare soft tissue neoplasms derived from fascial or musculoaponeurotic structures. These tumors are histologically benign but may behave aggressively at the local level with multiple recurrences after complete resection being common. Chest wall desmoids account for approximately 20% of all patients with desmoid tumors. Patients with these lesions are often asymptomatic and thus commonly present with lesions greater than 10 cm in size. The treatment for these neoplasms remains margin negative surgical excision, and, given the often large size at presentation, may require extensive chest wall resection. When this is required, chest wall reconstruction with either prosthetic material and/or autologous tissue may be performed. There may be recurrence in as many as 75% of patients. Neither adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy have been shown to reduce the rate of recurrence. Recurrence should also be treated with surgical resection because patients who undergo complete surgical resection of recurrence are as likely to remain disease free after resection as patients who present with primary disease."
"Fibromatoses represent a spectrum of nonneoplastic spindle cell tumors frequently identified in childhood. Although they may be locally aggressive, they do not metastasize. The authors have reviewed their experience of these lesions in an attempt to identify clinical and pathological features suggestive of recurrence. METHODS: Clinical records and pathological specimens from 55 cases of fibromatosis diagnosed and treated at British Columbia's Children's Hospital from 1982 to 1995 were reviewed. RESULTS: Thirty boys and 25 girls with ages ranging from 1 month to 14 years were identified. Eighteen tumors (33%) were congenital. Diagnoses were as follows: musculoaponeurotic fibromatosis (n = 27), infantile myofibromatosis (n = 10), Dupuytren-type fibromatosis (n = 7), fibromatosis colli (n = 7), and digital fibroma (n = 4). Clinical follow-up showed a survival rate of 98%. The single mortality occurred in an infant born with an intraabdominal visceral myofibromatosis, which proved unresectable. Fifteen cases recurred (27%), and nine cases (16%) of infantile myofibromatosis spontaneously regressed. All remaining cases were controlled successfully by surgical resection. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical features suggestive of recurrence included (1) presentation at greater than 5 years of age, (2) extremity location of disease, and (3) incomplete surgical resection. Pathological features suggestive of recurrence were (1) microscopic evidence of tumor at resection margins, (2) mitotic index of 5 or more per 10 high-power fields, and (3) areas of necrosis and inflammation within the tumor."
"survival and recurrence. The 3-year survival rates were as follows: patients without ECS 73.4%, and with ECS 28.9% (p < .001); patients without a DP 76.9%, and with a DP 43.3% (p < .03). Also, the 3-year recurrence rates in the neck showed significant differences: patients without ECS 10.7%, and with ECS 49.6% (p < .001); patients without a DP 10%, and with a DP 31.6% (p = .1142). Postoperative radiotherapy did not appear to improve the outcome."
"Extra-abdominal desmoid tumors are locally aggressive benign soft tissue tumors arising from the connective tissue of muscle and overlying fascia or aponeuroses. Location around the hip occurs in about 10% of all desmoid tumors. The authors report the development of a desmoid tumor around the hip 45 months after implantation of a total hip prosthesis. Endocrine and physical factors seem to play an important role in the development of the disease. Moreover, an association has been reported between trauma and desmoid tumor. Desmoid tumors developing around silicon implants have also been described. However, no association between hip prostheses and desmoid tumors has been published in the world literature. Although soft tissue tumors induced by metallic implants have been observed clinically, we still seek a coherent explanation for the exact pathogenesis."
"To review the surgical management and outcomes for large desmoid tumours of the abdominal wall. METHODS: Seven patients with large desmoid tumours of the anterior abdominal wall were treated by wide local excision and reconstruction with two layers of Marlex V mesh (Bard, Galway, Ireland). RESULTS: No patient having initial surgery at this hospital has either a significant residual functional deficit or developed a recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Large desmoid tumours of the abdominal wall are safely and adequately managed with abdominal wall resection followed by mesh reconstruction."
"A rare case of extra-abdominal desmoid tumor is reported. A palpable mass was detected in the right breast of a 47-year-old man. Mammography showed a stellate mass without calcification, and breast ultrasound examination revealed a solid, inhomogeneous, non-calcified lesion. The result of cytological examination of the fine-needle aspiration biopsy specimen was equivocal. Histology of the surgical specimen showed extra-abdominal desmoid tumor. Extra-abdominal presentation of this semimalignant tumor is rare and may mimic malignant breast tumor. Differential diagnosis is difficult and usually based on the result of the histological examination."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a locally infiltrative fibroblastic tumour that arises from fascial planes of soft tissue but does not metastasize. It is known to invade muscle, subcutaneous tissue and neurovascular structures. However, bone involvement is very rare and there has been few reports of bone involvement. We present a case of a young man with aggressive fibromatosis of the right lower leg with fibula involvement."
"The authors report the case of an adult female patient who developed a paraspinous thoracic fibromatosis (desmoid tumor) after undergoing resection of an intraspinal thoracic meningioma that was complicated by postoperative wound infection. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of such a tumor occurring after resection of a spinal meningioma. Awareness of the development of postoperative fibromatosis and recognition of its association with wound sepsis is important. Although rare, this distinctive lesion should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the apparent rapid regrowth of otherwise indolent lesions including meningioma."
"A desmoid tumor of the shoulder girdle infiltrating the upper chest wall and weighing 1500 g was almost completely removed in an 18-year-old man, 27 months after a bifocal fracture of the clavicule. Thirteen years later, the patient was free of recurrence. The interval time between trauma and diagnosis, as the particular characteristics of aggressive fibromatosis, strongly support a major causal role of the clavicular fracture in the occurrence of this tumor."
"CT and MR imaging studies were performed in a 3-year-old boy with infantile fibromatosis arising from the infratemporal fossa and extending into the middle cranial fossa. On CT scans, the lesion was hyperattenuating (44-49 Hounsfield units [HU]), enhancing significantly after application of contrast material (63-66 HU). The MR images showed a multilobulated lesion of heterogeneous signal intensity. The tumor was markedly hypointense on T2-weighted images and slightly hypointense on T1-weighted images relative to brain tissue, iso- or slightly hyperintense relative to tongue muscle on both T2- and T1-weighted images, and enhanced strongly after administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine."
"Mutations in the APC gene contribute to development of sporadic desmoid tumors as well as to the hereditary tumors that usually accompany familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutations cause an intracellular accumulation of beta-catenin that results in abnormal signaling in the wnt/wingless pathway. Mutations of the beta-catenin gene itself have also been noted in several types of tumors. In this study we screened the beta-catenin gene in 13 sporadic desmoid tumors for alterations in exon 3, which encodes several serine/threonine residues that are targets for phosphorylation by GSK-3beta. Somatic substitutions at codons 41 (threonine) and 45 (serine) were identified in seven independent tumors, respectively. Although no APC mutations were detected among the remaining six tumors, we found accumulation of beta-catenin by Western blotting analysis in one such tumor for which frozen tissues were available. Our results have suggested that possible involvement of beta-catenin activation by beta-catenin gene mutation or alteration of other factor(s) can contribute to desmoid tumorigenesis."
"To analyze patients with recurrent extremity desmoids, in whom the surgical therapeutic option was either major amputation or observation. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The biology and natural history of desmoid tumors are an enigma. These tumors invade surrounding structures and recur locally but do not metastasize. The morbidity of treating these tumors in the context of their relatively benign biology is uncertain. METHODS: Between July 1982 and June 1998, the authors treated and prospectively followed 206 patients with extremity desmoid tumors. All patients underwent standardized surgical resection, the surgical goal always being complete resection with negative margins. When tumors recurred, they were evaluated for reresection. Amputation was considered when resection was not possible because of neurovascular or major bone involvement, or in the presence of a functionless, painful extremity. RESULTS: During this period, 22 patients had disease that was not resectable without amputation. This was out of a total of 115 patients with primary disease and 91 patients with recurrent disease. All recurrences were local; in no patient did metastasis develop. In this group of 22 patients with unresectable disease, 7 underwent amputation and 15 did not. These 15 patients were followed, alive with disease, having no surgical resection. Four patients received systemic treatment with tamoxifen and nonsteroidal antiinflammatories, three received systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy, and two received both tamoxifen and chemotherapy. Six patients received no systemic treatment. The range of follow-up was 25 to 92 months. In all patients, there was no or insignificant tumor progression; in three patients who underwent observation alone, there was some regression of tumor. During follow-up, no patient has required subsequent amputation, and no patient has died from disease. CONCLUSIONS: In desmoid tumors, aggressive attempts at achieving negative resection margins may result in unnecessary morbidity. Function- and structure-preserving procedures should be the primary goal. In select patients, whose only option is amputation, it may be prudent to observe them with their limb and tumor intact."
"Desmoid tumor is a rare neoplasm with extra-abdominal location and female predilection. Anatomopatological analysis is necessary to establish the diagnosis unequivocally, but Magnetic Resonance is the no aggressive method with the best sensitivity and specificity. Surgical resection is the elective treatment yet, and prognosis is not so good as it could be expected in a benign tumor. We report a young male case without polyposis coli antecedents. When he was attended, he related only an abdominal bulk with no other symptom. An intra-abdominal mass 32 cm length per 25 cm width consistent with desmoid tumor was finally resected."
"plain radiography, ultrasonography, nuclear medicine, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. However, MR imaging is the method of choice for assessing the full extents of cervicothoracic lesions and their relationships to neurovascular structures. Cervicothoracic lesions can be classified as congenital lesions, inflammatory lesions, benign tumors, malignant tumors, and traumatic lesions. Lymphangioma is the most common cervicothoracic mass in children; other congenital lesions include hemangioma, thymic cyst, and vascular anomalies. Inflammatory adenopathy reactive to tuberculosis, mononucleosis, tularemia, cat-scratch fever, infection with human immunodeficiency virus, or other upper respiratory tract infections can manifest as cervicothoracic lesions; tuberculous abscesses and abscesses of other origins can also be seen. Lipoma, lipoblastoma, aggressive fibromatosis, and nerve sheath tumors (either isolated lesions or those associated with neurofibromatosis) can also occur as cervicothoracic masses. Malignant cervicothoracic tumors include lymphoma, thyroid carcinoma, neuroblastoma, and chest wall tumors (rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and neuroectodermal tumor). Traumatic cervicothoracic lesions include pneumomediastinum of traumatic origin, traumatic pharyngeal pseudodiverticulum, esophageal foreign-body granuloma, and cervicothoracic hematoma."
"Desmoid tumors are locally invasive fibromatous tumors, which, in patients with Gardner's syndrome, usually occur in the abdominal wall or intra-abdominally. After excision, they tend to recur, often leading to multiple bowel resections. METHODS: This is a report of the clinical course of a patient with Gardner's syndrome and desmoid tumor who had multiple enterectomies and gradually developed short-gut syndrome. He required prolonged parenteral nutrition, which damaged the liver. The patient underwent a multivisceral transplantation as a life-saving procedure. RESULTS: After the transplant, the desmoid tumor recurred in the thoracic wall twice and was successfully resected. It also recurred in the abdominal cavity, compressing the intestinal loops; the tumor was excised uneventfully, leaving the graft intact. The recurrent tumors were all of recipient origin. CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal and multivisceral transplantation could be considered in patients with short-gut syndrome caused by recurrent desmoid tumor. In the case of posttransplant tumor recurrence, resection is the only option recommended."
"Desmoid tumors are locally invasive fibrous neoplasms that arise from musculoaponeurotic structures. We report the first case of a desmoid tumor of the larynx complicating pregnancy. At 21 weeks' gestation fiberoptic and indirect otolaryngologic examination of the patient's larynx revealed a submucosal tumor involving the left true vocal cord, ventricle of the larynx, and false vocal cord. Histopathologic examination revealed areas of extensive fibrosis intermixed with degenerated vocal cord skeletal muscle. Despite a subtotal excisional biopsy, growth of the desmoid tumor continued during pregnancy. Endoscopic evaluation 9 weeks post partum revealed complete regression of the tumor."
"In patients with either desmoids or fibromatosis who do not tolerate vinblastine and methotrexate because of neurotoxicity, the combination of vinorelbine and methotrexate can be substituted in most. Patients with the same condition who had not been previously treated with a combination of vinblastine and methotrexate responded well to the combination of vinorelbine and methotrexate, with significantly less neurotoxicity and a similar objective and subjective response rate. Sixty percent of patients had either a substantial partial remission or a complete remission. In no patients did the disease progress while they were receiving this therapy. Symptomatic relief, primarily of pain, occurred in 80% of patients. While minimal neurotoxicity was seen in 16% of these patients, it did not interfere with the completion of therapy. The combination of vinorelbine and methotrexate appears to be active in the treatment of both desmoid tumors and fibromatosis and is associated with significantly less neurotoxicity then that seen with the combination of vinblastine and methotrexate. No long-term toxicity was seen in any patient in this series."
Pleural fluid was diagnosed on an X-ray in a 9-month-old boy with acute dyspnoea without fever. Thoracentesis showed exudate and the patient was diagnosed as having empyema and was treated with continuous chest tube drainage and antibiotics. The culture of the pleural fluid was negative. A month after discharge the boy developed recurrent pleural effusion with dyspnoea. A mass in the right hemithorax was found upon additional diagnostic evaluation. Microscopic evaluation of tumour biopsy specimen showed a malignancy. Infantile fibromatosis was diagnosed in a surgical specimen. The patient died after having developed a recurrent tumour. Infectious causes are not likely in a child with pleural fluid without fever. Pleural fluid has to be analysed in transudate or exudate. Exudate requires a complete diagnostic evaluation.
"Trisomy 8 and trisomy 20 are nonrandom aberrations in desmoid tumors. The presence of these trisomies in related benign fibrous lesions of bone has not been previously addressed. In this study, 22 specimens from 19 patients diagnosed with desmoid tumor, desmoplastic fibroma, periosteal desmoid tumor, osteofibrous dysplasia, or fibrous dysplasia were examined by cytogenetic analysis of short-term cultures and bi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization of cytological touch preparations or paraffin-embedded tissue with centromeric probes for chromosomes 8 and 20. Trisomy 8 and trisomy 20 were detected by molecular cytogenetic methodologies in 15 specimens, including 10 primary bone lesions. Traditional cytogenetic analysis revealed trisomy 8 in two cases of osteofibrous dysplasia. Our findings demonstrate that trisomy 8 and trisomy 20 are also nonrandom aberrations in histologically similar, but clinically distinct, benign fibrous lesions of bone."
"Two families with autosomal dominantly inherited desmoid tumors have recently been shown to have germline mutations at the 3' end of the APC gene. We subsequently identified an Amish family with autosomal dominantly inherited desmoid tumors. Genetic analysis performed on one family member, a 47-year-old man with multiple desmoid tumors and no colon polyps, revealed a protein truncating mutation in the middle of the APC gene. The truncating mutation is the result of a 337-bp insertion of an Alu I sequence into codon 1526 of the APC gene. The presence of a poly(A) tail at the 3' end of the insertion suggests that the Alu I sequence was inserted by a retrotranspositional event. Germline insertions of Alu I sequences have occasionally been reported to cause other genetic diseases including type I neurofibromatosis, hereditary site-specific breast cancer (BRCA2), and hemophilia B. However, this is the first report of a germline mutation of the APC gene resulting from an Alu I insertion."
"Using an interdisciplinary clinical and molecular approach, the authors identified APC germline mutations in families with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Correlation of mutation site with disease manifestation and the impact of molecular data on clinical proceedings were examined. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Germline mutations in the APC gene predispose to FAP. Established and proposed genotype-phenotype correlations as well as the influence of mutation site on surgical procedures have been reported. The predictive value of APC mutation analysis for disease manifestation and therapeutic decision making needs to be investigated further. METHODS: One hundred twenty-three kindreds of the local FAP registry were included in this study. CHRPE phenotype was defined as at least one large characteristic lesion or a total of four lesions in both eyes. APC mutations were identified by protein truncation test and automated DNA sequencing from patient lymphocyte DNA and RNA. RESULTS: APC germline mutations were identified in 85/123 families with FAP. They were located between codons 213 and 1581 of the APC gene and displayed distinct genotype-phenotype correlations. CHRPE status facilitated mutation analysis by discriminating regions of interest within the APC coding region. Severe manifestations of desmoids were restricted to mutations between codons 1444 through 1581. Whereas 91% (75/82) of at-risk persons were excluded as mutation carriers, APC germline mutations were detected before clinical examination in 9% (7/82) of at-risk persons. One patient agreed to endoscopy only after mutation detection. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the feasibility of combined molecular and clinical screening of families with FAP and may provide a guideline for routine presymptomatic molecular diagnostics in a clinical laboratory."
"Primary extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) is a solitary tumor that arises outside the bone marrow in patients without clinical evidence of coexisting multiple myeloma. EMP represents only 4% of all patients with plasma cell malignancies. The tumor generally occurs in the submucosal tissue of the upper airway or oral cavity. 10% of all EMP occur in the gastrointestinal tract. Only 8 cases of EMP in the duodenum have been reported in literature. METHOD: The authors present a case of EMP in the duodenum in a 53 year old men. The tumor was initially misdiagnosed as desmoid tumor. With a combined treatment of surgery and chemotherapy complete remission for 2 years was achieved, followed by a dissemination of the tumor in the testis, mandibular bone and ribs. CONCLUSION: EMP is a rare differential diagnosis of an intraabdominal tumor. Diagnosis is difficult, and in most reported cases it is confirmed only postoperatively after immunohistochemical staining. Combined treatment of surgery and chemotherapy seem to offer the best potential for cure."

"We report the case of a 22-year-old-man having a familial adenomatous polyposis coli treated by total colectomy with ileo-rectal anastomosis. Two years after the operation, an asymptomatic mesenteric fibromatosis appeared which was nonresectable due to mesenteric vessels infiltration. Nine years later, sulindac therapy was started for residual polyps in the rectal stump. This treatment was taken intermittently, during periods of 1 to 8 months, for 6 years. After 4 years of treatment, the tumor was no longer palpable. Four years after sulindac discontinuation, the patient was operated on for suspicion of intestinal adhesion. The mesenteric fibromatosis had completely disappeared and mesenteric vessels were free. This complete macroscopic regression of a desmoid tumor after sulindac therapy emphasizes again the interest of this treatment for mesenteric fibromatosis."
"A case of an aggressive desmoid tumor in a patient with familial adenomatous polyposis is described. The lesion rapidlyenlarged with compression of adjacent structures including the ureter and small bowel, and the patient died because of small bowel perforation and hydronephrosis 3 years after detection of small desmoid tumors at the time of a prophylactic coloproctectomy for a colon carcinoma. Immunohistochemically, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), p21WAF1/CIP1 and cathepsin D indices, but not the bcl-2 index, which were defined as the numbers of immunoreactive tumor cells per 1000 tumor cells, increased in line with tumor progression. The tumor did not show staining for collagen IV, but was characterized by intense staining for basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Accordingly, tumor aggression was related to increases in both cell proliferation and protease activity, as well as an enhanced expression of bFGF. In addition, the desmoid tumor showed deregulation between PCNA and p21WAF1/CIP1 because the normal inverse relation between these two was not apparent."

"Intrathoracic desmoid tumors of the pleura are unusual tumors that are often clinically and histologically confused with localized fibrous tumor of the pleura or benign neurogenic tumors. We studied four cases of intrathoracic desmoid tumor of the pleura and reviewed the clinical, histopathologic, and immunohistochemical features of the four patients. Two men and two women, ranging in age from 16 to 66 years (mean, 44 yr) comprised the study group. Three patients presented with chest pain and one with shortness of breath. Two patients had a history of associated trauma in the area of the tumor. Three of the lesions were based in the parietal pleura and one in the visceral pleura. Treatment included complete resection (two cases), subtotal resection (one case), and subtotal resection followed by radiation therapy and complete resection (one case). The mean tumor size was 12.5 cm, and all of the tumors exhibited a bosselated, firm, white, cut surface. The histologic features of intrathoracic desmoid tumors were similar to those of desmoid tumors at more conventional sites. Infiltration of the adjacent fat and skeletal muscle was invariably present. The tumor cells were immunoreactive for vimentin, desmin, smooth muscle actin, and muscle-specific actin in three of the four cases and were negative for S-100 protein. Follow-up to date shows stable residual disease at 12 months (one case) and two patients with no evidence of disease at 12 and 96 months, respectively. Intrathoracic desmoid tumors often exhibit clinical and radiographic features similar to localized fibrous tumor of the pleura. They generally have histologic and behavioral characteristics identical to those of desmoid tumors at conventional sites. Like desmoid tumors elsewhere, complete resection with negative margins is vital to prevent local recurrence. Desmoid tumor should be considered in the differential of localized fibrous tumor of the pleura."
"To examine the clinical and pathological features of pediatric myofibroma of the head and neck and to discuss the challenges in diagnosis and treatment. DESIGN: A retrospective search of pathology department and clinical records to identify patients with myofibroma and a retrospective review of English-language medical publications. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENTS: Thirteen pediatric patients (aged from birth to 8 years old) diagnosed as having myofibroma of the head and neck. RESULTS: Nine of 13 patients were cured with conservative surgical excision. Four patients (31%) had recurrence, requiring multiple surgical procedures. One third showed spontaneous regression clinically or by histological examination. The clinical course did not parallel the histological appearance, as high cellularity and mitotic figures were commonplace among the specimens. A misdiagnosis of malignancy was not unusual in this series, as 3 patients had an initial diagnosis of fibrosarcoma, which on review was revised to myofibroma. CONCLUSIONS: Myofibromatosis is a distinct disorder among the great number of fibrous proliferations occurring in infants and children, with a particular predilection for the head and neck region. These lesions should be clearly distinguished from conventional adult-type fibromatoses (desmoid tumors), which are more aggressive. Most patients have solitary lesions that respond well to conservative surgical excision, whereas a few of these lesions behave more aggressively, requiring several surgical procedures for the management of recurrent or persistent tumor. Many of these lesions show spontaneous regression, suggesting that lesions not affecting vital functions, resulting in growth anomalies, or demonstrating rapid aggressive growth may be managed conservatively."
"We describe a unique case of a de novo desmoid tumor of the posterior mediastinum in a 21-year-old nulligravida. The tumor recurred twice despite its histologically confirmed radical extirpations. Because of the aggressive local behavior of desmoid tumors and their unusual locations, which prevent wide excision margins, we favor the early consideration of adjuvant therapy."
"Plantar fibromatosis is a rare, benign lesion involving the plantar aponeurosis. Eleven patients (13 feet) underwent 24 operations, including local excision, wide excision, or complete plantar fasciectomy. Clinical results were evaluated retrospectively. There were no differences among the subgroups in postoperative complications. Two primary fasciectomies did not recur. Three of six revised fasciectomies, seven of nine wide excisions, and six of seven local excisions recurred. Our results indicate that recurrence of plantar fibromatosis after surgical resection can be reduced by aggressive initial surgical resection."
"The 30-year experience of P.A. Herzen Moscou Cancer Research Institute in the treatment of soft tissue desmoid fibromas (DF) is summarized. A comparative study of effectiveness of surgical, combined, radiation and medicamentous methods was carried out. Frequency of recurrences after surgical treatment made up 94%, after combined treatment with preoperative radiation it decreased 3-fold (27.5%), in cases of postoperative radiation it made up 53%, and after radiation therapy--15.7%. However radiation therapy may have limitations due to necessity for irradiation of large tumour masses and usage of high-dose ionized irradiation which results in development of postradiation tissue damages. Further research brought about an original chemohormonal therapy (tamoxiphen, vinblastin, methotrexate), which provides stable recovery in 81.3% of patients. Principal positions for management of DF are formulated."
"To evaluate the outcome of patients with extra-mesenteric desmoid tumors treated with radiation therapy, with or without surgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The outcome for 75 patients receiving radiation for desmoid tumor with or without complete gross resection between 1965 and 1994 was retrospectively reviewed utilizing univariate and multivariate statistical methods. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 7.5 years, the overall freedom from relapse was 78% and 75% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Of the total, 23 patients received radiation for gross disease because it was not resectable. Of these 23 patients, 7 sustained local recurrence, yielding a 31% actuarial relapse rate at 5 years. Radiation dose was the only significant determinant of disease control in this group. A dose of 50 Gy was associated with a 60% relapse rate, whereas higher doses yielded a 23% relapse rate (p < 0.05). The other 52 patients received radiation in conjunction with gross total resection of tumor. The 5- and 10-year relapse rates were 18% and 23%, respectively. No factor correlated significantly with disease outcome. There was no evidence that radiation doses exceeding 50 Gy improved outcome. Positive resection margins were not significantly deleterious in this group of irradiated patients. For all 75 patients, there was no evidence that radiation margins exceeding 5 cm beyond the tumor or surgical field improved local-regional control. Ultimately, 72 of the 75 patients were rendered disease-free, but 3 required extensive surgery (amputation, hemipelvectomy) to achieve this status. Significant radiation complications were seen in 13 patients. Radiation dose correlated with the incidence of complications. Doses of 56 Gy or less produced a 5% 15-year complication rate, compared to a 30% incidence with higher doses (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Radiation is an effective modality for desmoid tumors, either alone or as an adjuvant to resection. For patients with negative resection margins, postoperative radiation is not recommended. Patients with positive margins should almost always receive 50 Gy of postoperative radiation. Unresectable tumors should be irradiated to a dose of approximately 56 Gy, with a 75% expectation of local control."
"The authors compare the progression-free survival of patients with unresected or partially resected desmoid tumors treated with radiotherapy with those not given radiotherapy. A retrospective analysis and pathologic review was performed on 14 patients treated at the University of California Los Angeles School of Medicine from 1965 through 1992. Median follow-up was 6 years. The 6-year progression-free survival for irradiated patients was 100%, compared with 50% for those not irradiated (p = 0.04). Of the seven patients irradiated, only two had a complete response and one had a partial response. There was no difference in disease-specific survival between patients irradiated and those not irradiated, because only 1 of 14 patients died of desmoid tumor progression, which caused airway obstruction. This data suggest that radiotherapy may improve the progression-free survival of patients with unresected or partially resected desmoid tumor; however, the number of patients in this series is small. Most patients did not have a complete response to radiotherapy. For patients with tumor adjacent to the airway in the neck or upper thorax, the authors recommend radiotherapy because of the potential for mortality. Otherwise, because tumor progression rarely causes death, one must consider whether the morbidity of treatment would outweigh the morbidity of disease progression."
"We report a rare case of ""benign spindle cell tumor of the breast with prominent adipocytic component"" and present a review of the literature on the topic. The close morphologic resemblance with myofibroblastoma and spindle cell lipoma of the breast is emphasized and used as a starting point for diagnostic and histogenetic considerations. Although immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy showed features favoring a diagnosis of spindle cell lipoma, they were not conclusive. The tumor described here contributes to widen the spectrum of the benign spindle cell tumors of the breast variously named ""benign spindle cell tumor,"" myofibroblastoma, spindle cell lipoma, and fibroma. It is important to distinguish this lesion from spindle cell metaplastic carcinoma and aggressive fibromatosis."
"We investigated whether the therapeutic action of sulindac, used for the treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis, desmoid tumors, and against colon cancer, could be mediated by its active metabolite, sulindac sulfide, in cell growth and apoptosis on cell lines derived from abdominal neoplasms. Sulindac sulfide actions on cell growth and apoptosis were evaluated in epithelial human colon tumor 8 (HCT8) cell line and mesenchymal cell lines (bovine bone endothelial (BBE) cell line, desmoid tumor-derived cells, human colorectal cancer-derived fibroblasts). Sulindac sulfide (0.1-60 microg/ml) induced a dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation of all cell lines tested. Apoptosis was induced at doses of 20 and 40 microg/ml, respectively, in BBE and HCT8 cells with no effect on desmoid tumor cells and colorectal cancer-derived fibroblasts. Since mesenchymal cells respond to clinically effective concentrations of the compound, its preferential action on the stromal compartment of intestinal polyps, desmoid tumors and colon cancer can be proposed, with consequent regression of the tumor."
"Desmoid tumors develop in the muscle or aponeurosis, but rarely in the chest wall. We report a patient with desmoid tumor in the chest wall. A 30-year-old female visited our hospital due to an abnormal shadow in the chest detected at a health examination. No definite diagnosis could be made by chest CT, MRI, or Ga scintigraphy, and finally a biopsy demonstrated desmoid tumor. The left anterior chest and posterolateral chest (lung apex) were opened, and tumors were resected together with the chest wall. No radiotherapy was performed. No recurrence has been observed for 1.5 years after operation. This tumor does not yield distant metastasis, but its recurrence rate is very high. Therefore, we intend to follow this patient for a long period."
"Desmoid tumors are uncommon fibromatous tumors arising from musculoaponeurotic tissue characterized by spindle cell fibroblast and myofibroblast proliferation. The cause is unknown (trauma, hormonal factors, genetic anomaly...). Locally invasive, they tend to recur increasing morbidity or even mortality. CASE REPORT: Stiff shoulder resulting from blockage of the scapulothoracic articulation was the inaugural sign. Three-phase bone scintigraphy demonstrated early uptake in the soft tissue in contact with the scapula. Magnetic resonance imaging and biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of desmoid tumor. Complete resection was performed. No adjuvant radiotherapy nor hormone treatment were given since no antiestrogen receptor antibodies were identified on the surgical specimen. DISCUSSION: The clinical manifestation (stiff shoulder) and the scapular localization observed in this case are unusual for desmoid tumors. Initially tendinopathy of the shoulder, acromio-clavicular arthropathy and capsular retraction of the shoulder joint had been entertained. Early diagnosis and wide surgical resection are indicated in desmoid tumors."
"juvenile fibromatosis and adult fibromatosis. It is also possible to distinguish between superficial fibromatosis of the aponeurosis and deep fibromatosis of the muscle-aponeurosis. Histopathological findings have indicated that fibromatosis is an invasive neoformation of fibromatous connective tissue involving adjacent structures. It does not metastasize, though recurrence rates vary. Treatment is based on either excision of the mass, or radiotherapy and chemotherapy if the condition is inoperable. We describe a case of fibromatosis of the mandible in a young girl. The growth was excised completely and she was still disease-free four years later."
"The aim of this study was to review the management of desmoid tumors in patients who have undergone ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for familial adenomatous polyposis and their outcome. METHODS: A retrospective review of case notes was undertaken in a series of 196 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis who had had an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Eleven patients were identified in whom desmoid tumor had developed (4 male; median age, 30 (range, 16-43) years). RESULTS: Desmoid tumors developed in the abdominal wall alone in 4 of 11 patients. Three enlarging tumors were resected with no subsequent recurrence. No patient received adjuvant treatment and pouch function remained stable at a median follow-up of eight years. Mesenteric desmoid tumors developed in seven patients; the pouch has been excised in two because of ischemia; two other patients have had defunctioning stomas created because of slow progression of their desmoid tumors. One patient had a single-lumen pouch excised and a new S-pouch inserted, with no subsequent recurrence of the desmoid tumor, and in two patients the mesenteric desmoid tumor has remained unchanged. All of these patients received long-term Clinoril (sulindac, Merck & Co., Inc., West Point, PA). Although there has been no significant deterioration in pouch function in patients in whom the pouch remains in situ, the pouch function was significantly worse compared with a control group of patients after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for familial adenomatous polyposis in whom desmoid tumors did not develop. CONCLUSION: Desmoid tumors developed in 5.6 percent of 196 patients after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for familial adenomatous polyposis. No patient with abdominal-wall desmoid tumor had a recurrence after local excision. By contrast, mesenteric desmoid tumors eventually resulted in pouch failure in four of seven affected patients."

"Aggressive fibromatoses are proliferations of fibrous tissue that infiltrate surrounding tissues and tend to recur after surgical resection. We report a series of five children with aggressive fibromatosis involving the cranial base. METHODS: A search of the database maintained by the Medical Informatics Department at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center identified 78 patients with aggressive fibromatosis of the head and neck. Of these patients, five demonstrated involvement of the cranial base. All five were children. A retrospective review of the charts, diagnostic images, and pathological findings for these five patients was performed. RESULTS: Surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy were the treatment methods used. Four patients underwent gross total resections, but tumor cells were present at the margins in all cases. Two of these four patients experienced recurrences; one patient was cured of disease by a second surgical resection and radiotherapy, and the other underwent a second gross total resection. The fifth patient underwent a subtotal resection. He has experienced four recurrences and continues to live with residual disease. One transformation to a Grade 2 fibrosarcoma was observed. CONCLUSION: Fibromatoses of the cranial base are rare and seem to be most common in the pediatric age group. Gross total resection, preferably in the first attempt, should be the goal. Radiotherapy and hormonal therapy are useful adjunctive methods for the treatment of aggressive fibromatosis. Fibromatoses that involve the cranial base are most likely to require a multidisciplinary treatment approach."

Desmoid tumour is an unusual and aggressive tumour associated with a high recurrence rate. A 35-year-old man presented with recurrent debilitating left arm pain 2 years after undergoing bilateral transaxillary first rib resection for thoracic outlet syndrome. Nerve conduction studies demonstrated impairment of nerve conduction in the left arm. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brachial plexus demonstrated a mass at the apex of the left hemithorax involving the lower cord of the brachial plexus. Subsequent percutaneous needle biopsies failed to provided a definitive diagnosis. A cervicothoracic approach as described by Dartevelle was used to resect the lesion. Histologic and ultrastructural studies confirmed the diagnosis of a desmoid tumour. This report describes the atypical presentation of this unusual tumour and the application of the novel Dartevelle approach to secure its complete excision.
"We reported a fourteen-month-old boy with infantile digital fibromatosis. At the age of seven months, a nodule appeared on the back of the left third toe, and developed into a slight red tumor divided into five hemispherical nodules. Histopathologically, spindle-shaped tumor cells with an eosinophilic inclusion body in the cytoplasm were seen in the dermis. Electron microscopy showed a dense body in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells. One year and two months after the first visit, the tumor regressed without any aggressive treatment. Japanese cases of infantile digital fibromatosis were reviewed. The literature review and our case suggest that the tumor should be observed without any aggressive treatment unless it causes mobile dysfunction of the affected finger or toe."
"Bcl-2 is one of the many proteins that regulate programmed cell death and is overexpressed in B-cell lymphomas. The expression of bcl-2 in mesenchymal cells and soft tissue tumours was the subject of this study. Normal mesenchymal tissue and representative cases of soft tissue tumours of different types (n>200) were investigated immunohistochemically for bcl-2 expression. Although bcl-2 expression was normally relatively restricted to some smooth muscle cells and neural cells, bcl-2 immunoreactivity was widespread in different types of soft tissue neoplasms, both benign and malignant. Consistently positive tumours included solitary fibrous tumour, haemangiopericytoma, schwannoma and synovial sarcoma. The few soft tissue tumours that were consistently negative for bcl-2 included nodular fasciitis and desmoid tumour. Leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas were heterogeneous; all uterine leiomyomas were bcl-2 positive, but all oesophageal leiomyomas were negative, paralleling the reactivity observed in the smooth muscle at those sites. Gastrointestinal stromal tumours showed bcl-2 reactivity; this was less consistent in malignant tumours. Along the malignancy gradient, there was no consistent trend in the bcl-2 reactivity. Dermatofibrosarcomas showed increase of bcl-2 expression with fibrosarcomatous transformation, whereas smooth muscle sarcomas and malignant peripheral nerve sheath sarcomas were less consistently positive than the corresponding benign neoplasms. We conclude that bcl-2 expression is widespread in soft tissue tumours, but shows constitutional expression patterns that are often parallel to the normal tissue counterparts. Compared with benign soft tissue tumours, bcl-2 expression is often reduced in sarcomas, but it cannot be used as a prognostic marker without correlation of the data to its phenotypic expression patterns."
"A 45-year-old man was referred to our hospital for recurrent desmoid tumor of the chest wall. He underwent chest wall resection with reconstruction of Marlex mesh. But we could not resect it enough widely, because the tumor invaded beside left subclavian artery and subclavian vein, brachioflexus. So he had additional radiation therapy (50 gry). The patient is now doing well without recurrence 1 year after the operation."
"Fibromatosis covers a broad group of benign fibrous tissue proliferations of varied microscopic appearances that are intermediate in their biological behaviour between bengin fibrous tumour and fibrosarcoma, Extra abdominal fibromatosis in the neck occassionally cause serious sequellae when aggressive invasion of vital structure occurs. However, the principle of wide excision is difficult to apply in some patients because of the important organs surrounding the tumour. We describe a primary spindle cell tumour of thyroid that raised initial diagnostic problems and was eventually diagnosed as fibromatosis of thyroid gland."
"Desmoids are locally aggressive, non-metastasizing soft-tissue tumours, whose aetiology is still unclear. In patients affected with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the incidence of desmoids is much higher than in the general population. The APC gene, which is responsible for FAP, is involved in the development of desmoids associated with this syndrome. In this study 16 sporadic and four FAP-related desmoids were analysed in order to investigate the possible involvement of APC in non-syndromic cases also. The 5' end (exons 1-11) and the coding portion of exon 15 of APC were screened using the in vitro synthesized-protein assay (IVSP). Exons 5, 6, 8-14, and a region of exon 15 spanning codons 1036-1634 were investigated by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. APC germline mutations were identified in all FAP patients, but not in sporadic cases. Somatic mutations were found in three FAP-associated desmoids (75%) and two sporadic tumours (12.5%). In one of the latter cases, both alleles were affected. These findings indicate a limited role of the gene in the development of desmoid tumours outside FAP."
"1 to 7). Out of 12 tumors associated with pregnancy or Gardner's syndrome, only two displayed changes. The minimal common regions of the most frequent gains were 1q21 (39%), chromosome 20 (32%), and 9p12 (21%). No high-level amplifications were detected. Losses of DNA sequences were two times less frequent than gains and the minimal common regions of the most frequent losses were 6q16-q21 (14%), 5q14 (11%), and 13q21-q31 (11%)."
"We report the treatment of 10 children for progressive desmoid tumor not amenable to standard surgical or radiation therapy with the use of vinblastine (VBL) and methotrexate (MTX). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients aged 6.4 to 18 years with primary (two patients) or recurrent (eight patients) desmoid tumor were treated with VBL and MTX for 2 to 35 months. Patients with recurrent tumors had been previously treated with surgical resection with (two patients) or without (five patients) radiation therapy or with radiation therapy alone (one patient). No patient had previously received cytotoxic chemotherapy. The tumor response was assessed at routine intervals by physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: Five patients had clinical evidence of response to therapy with complete resolution (three patients) or partial resolution (two patients) of physical examination and radiographic abnormalities. Three patients had stable disease during 10 to 35 months of treatment. Two of these patients had progressive disease 9 and 37 months after treatment stopped; one patient had no progression 16 months after therapy. Two additional patients with stable disease had chemotherapy discontinued after 2 and 3 months. Common side effects included mild alopecia and myelosuppression and moderate nausea and vomiting. In patients with responding tumors, MRI showed decreased tumor size and, in two patients, changes consistent with fibrosis and decreased cellularity of the tumor. CONCLUSION: Combination chemotherapy with VBL and MTX appears to control desmoid tumor without significant acute or long-term morbidity in most children. This may allow for further growth and development in these patients, which may decrease the morbidity of subsequent definitive therapy."
"To evaluate the frequency of osteosarcoma involving the foot and determine the clinical outcome of affected patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of osteosarcoma encountered between 1911 and 1992 at the Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute. In particular, we analyzed whether common clinical, radiographic, or histologic features could lead to a correct diagnosis of osteosarcoma of the foot. RESULTS: The bones of the foot were the primary site of osteosarcomas in 12 cases--0.6% of the entire series of such tumors at our institution during the study period. The mean age of the patients was 33 years. Initial symptoms were usually pain and swelling. Late diagnosis was common; the mean time interval between the first symptoms and diagnosis was 28 months. Misdiagnoses occurred in 6 of the 12 cases (50%): osteoblastoma, chondroblastoma, chondrosarcoma, osteoid osteoma, desmoid fibroma, and osteomyelitis were, respectively, the initial diagnoses. Histologically, 5 of the 12 tumors (42%) were low-grade lesions. Four of the seven patients with a high-grade tumor died of metastatic disease after a mean survival of 50 months. Eight patients are alive with no evidence of disease after a mean follow-up of 162 months. CONCLUSION: When a painful swelling in a bone of the foot is observed, even if numerous benign conditions (such as fractures, infections, or benign bone tumors) are far more likely to occur, osteosarcoma must be ruled out to avoid delays in the treatment. Osteosarcomas of the foot may easily be misdiagnosed, especially because they almost always occur in adults, in contrast to osteosarcomas in general. High-grade tumors of the foot are as aggressive as other osteosarcomas and should be managed accordingly--with use of a safe-margins surgical procedure and chemotherapy."
"In order to characterize human desmoid tumors in vitro, the production of collagen and elastin and the expression of collagen types alpha1(I), alpha1(III) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 mRNA were investigated in six desmoid tumors; five derived from familial adenomatous polyposis patients and one from a sporadic case. The proportion of collagen production to total protein production was determined by 3H-imino acid incorporation, an indicator of collagen synthesis, using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The proportion of collagen production to total protein production was much higher in all six desmoid tumors compared with human skin fibroblasts (HSF). Quantitatively, the rate of elastin synthesis in desmoid tumor cells monitored by valine-proline peptide was also significantly higher than in HSF. Pro-alpha1(I) collagen mRNA was highly expressed in both desmoid tumors and HSF at approximately the same level, whereas pro-alpha1(III) collagen mRNA was more abundant in some of the desmoid tumors than the normal skin fibroblastic cell lines. Tumor growth factor-beta1 mRNA, which is believed to stimulate collagen synthesis, was expressed in both desmoid tumors and HSF to the same extent. These results demonstrate the increased formation of collagen and elastin in desmoid tumors in vitro and suggest that the increased synthesis of elastin rather than of collagen and TGF-beta1 may be involved in increased fibrogenesis by desmoid tumors."
"it is a member of the adherens junction, and it binds transcription factors in the tcf-lef family, transactivating transcription. Cell cultures from aggressive fibromatoses containing an APC mutation were studied. Transient transfection of the full-length APC gene caused decreased proliferation and beta-catenin protein level in these cultures. To determine whether beta-catenin protein level was responsible for the change in proliferation rate, stable transfections of deltaN89beta-catenin (a stabilized form that is not degraded by APC, but retains all other functions) were achieved in half of the cultures derived from each tumor, whereas the other half were transfected with an empty vector. Transfection of the full-length APC gene in cultures that were stably transfected with deltaN89beta-catenin did not result in a change in proliferation. The type I promotor of p56lck contains an HMG consensus region, to which members of the tcf-lef family can bind. p56lck was expressed in cultures not transfected with the full-length APC gene and in cultures transfected with the full-length APC gene and deltaN89beta-catenin, but not in cultures transfected with only the full-length APC gene. These data show that APC truncating mutations give aggressive fibromatosis cells a proliferative advantage through beta-catenin and suggest that beta-catenin acts to transactivate transcription."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a rare illness in children. We analyzed the records of four patients, taken from a total of 505, all of which had different types of tumours, over a period of ten years. In the four cases, three were male and one female. Their ages ranged from 0-7 years old. We also did a review of this pathology. RESULTS: The illness may present itself a a painless mass found particularly in the pelvic area, knee, buttock and anterior mediastinum, respectively. Two of these cases presented lysis of osseous tissue shown in radiologic assays. The diagnosis was histological in every case. The only treatment was surgical in all of them. Two of the cases required only one intervention to achieve remission and up to now there has been no record of further illness. At the time of writing this paper the patients are alive after a follow-up period of thirty months. CONCLUSIONS: Up to now, no other alternative forms of treatment have been convincing. Adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy are probably beneficial, but the precise indication for its use is not well defined."
"Desmoid tumours occur in about 10 per cent of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), and are an important cause of morbidity and death. The natural history of desmoids was investigated by documenting prospectively the prevalence and progression of possible precursor lesions. METHODS: A group of patients with FAP and controls were examined at laparotomy. Another group, with FAP and no clinical evidence of desmoid, and a group of controls, underwent abdominopelvic computed tomography. RESULTS: At laparotomy 13 of 42 patients with FAP had fibromatous mesenteric plaques; seven of these had not had surgery. Seven had more extensive mesenteric fibromatosis and had undergone significantly more laparotomies than the rest. Of 103 patients scanned, two had desmoid tumours and 22 (21 per cent) had mesenteric fibromatosis. On follow-up both desmoid tumours grew rapidly; mesenteric fibromatosis was unchanged in eight and resolved in four of the 12 patients rescanned. CONCLUSION: A model of desmoid tumour development is suggested, analogous to the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, in which a less benign phenotype emerges as molecular genetic abnormalities accumulate: mesenteric plaque-like desmoid precursor lesions arise in many patients with FAP before surgery as a result of abnormal fibroblast function; some, perhaps stimulated by surgery, progress to mesenteric fibromatosis; these in turn can give rise to desmoid tumours."
"Telomerase activity may be required for unlimited growth of cells and is repressed in most somatic tissues, but is detectable in immortal cell lines, germ cells, many malignancies and some benign lesions. Desmoids are proliferative, locally invasive, non-metastasizing fibromatous tumours which rarely regress. They occur frequently in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), causing significant morbidity and death. Telomerase activity was assayed in desmoids from patients with and without FAP to assess the role of telomerase in the development of these lesions, and its potential as a prognostic marker and possible target for treatment. METHODS: Protein extracts from 11 desmoids from nine patients with FAP, and ten desmoids from ten patients without FAP, were analysed for telomerase activity by the telomeric repeat amplification protocol, a sensitive polymerase chain reaction-based assay. Six fibrosarcomas and a fibrosarcoma cell line were used as positive controls; all displayed telomerase activity. RESULTS: No telomerase activity was detected in any of the 21 desmoids studied. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that desmoid tumours are one of the intriguing exceptions to the emerging view that re-expression of telomerase activity accompanies the development of preneoplastic and neoplastic tissues, and suggest that alternative mechanisms may operate in these proliferative neoplasms."
"The Authors report a case of great desmoid tumor of the abdominal wall with intestinal adhesions and enterocutaneous fistula, in a patient with Gardner's syndrome, who underwent total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis. The patient was treated at first with non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, then with local chemotherapy. The Authors performed a second surgical procedure resecting the tumor and opening a temporary ileostomy. Despite of these treatment patient showed a local recurrence. Desmoid tumor is a neoplastic benign lesion arising from aponeurotic muscle tissue. Local infiltration and post-operative recurrence are very common. Several surgical and medical treatments are proposed, but they are not totally effective. Surgical treatment might be radical, with wide resection to reduce local recurrences. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are second choice treatments."

"Two cases of tumors of the soft tissues developing at the site of a previous traumatic injury occurring a few years earlier are reported. One was finally diagnosed as aggressive fibromatosis and the other as low-grade fibrosarcoma. Among the pathogenic mechanisms and the etiologic factors involved in such tumors, the posttraumatic causality is discussed, and in addition to the initial trauma, the role of iterative surgery in the first case and mineral muscular inclusions in the second case are examined. The different therapeutic approaches of such lesions are also reviewed."
A 10-week-old Akita puppy was evaluated for a reported umbilical hernia. Repair of the hernia had been attempted three times prior to referral. A defect in the ventral abdominal wall with an associated soft-tissue mass was identified on abdominal radiographs. Exploratory surgery was performed; the mass was resected and the abdominal wall defect was repaired. Histopathological evaluation of the mass was consistent with infantile desmoid-type fibromatosis.
Deep musculoaponeurotic fibromatoses are rare soft tissue neoplasms with a propensity for local recurrence. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was carried out of the factors contributing to local disease control in 75 patients treated between 1963 and 1993. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis identified the type of surgical excision (P < 0.001) and involvement of pathological resection margins (P < 0.02) as significant factors contributing to local recurrence. After a median follow up of 47 months (range 24 months to 29 years) 31 (49 per cent) of the 63 patients who had an 'adequate' surgical resection developed local recurrence. The median time before development of local recurrence was 83.4 (range 8-129) months in patients with clear pathological resection margins. This was significantly shortened to 13.1 (range 2-35) months in those with positive margins (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Adequate surgical extirpation is the most important determinant in local disease control. Treatment of local recurrence ranged from observation during periods of disease stabilization to multimodality treatment for aggressive disease.
"fibromatoses in adults and infants (infantile digital fibromatosis and infantile myofibromatosis); myofibroma of adults, an almost exclusively solitary lesion in the skin which is characterized morphologically as a biphasic lesion composed of spindle-shaped eosinophilic tumour cells and more primitive mesenchymal tumour cells associated with a haemangiopericytoma-like vasculature; dermatomyofibroma (plaque-like dermal fibromatosis), a band-like myofibroblastic proliferation in young female patients, which is mainly located in the periaxillar region and in which distinction from more aggressive, plaque-like variant of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is mandatory; myofibroblastoma of the breast, a well-circumscribed lesion composed of spindle shaped, desmin-positive tumour cells, which is seen mainly in elderly male patients and has to be distinguished from other spindle cell lesions of the breast; angiomyofibroblastoma, a well-circumscribed myofibroblastic neoplasm of the vulva and vagina composed of avoid to round myoid tumour cells with scattered multinucleated cells, which forms a continuous morphological spectrum with the clinically more aggressive angiomyxoma in this location; intranodal myofibroblastoma, a distinctive proliferation of myofibroblastic cells associated with so-called amianthoid fibres, which is seen most commonly in inguinal lymph nodes; myofibroblastoma/myofibroblastic tumour of soft tissues, a variably well-circumscribed myofibroblastic lesion which lacks atypia and is composed of actin and/or desmin positive tumour cells, and poorly delineated sarcomas with myofibroblastic differentiation (myofibrosarcoma)."
"(1) at the 5' end spanning exons 4 and 5, (2) within exon 9, and (3) at the 3' distal end of the gene. Variability in the number of colorectal adenomas was most apparent in individuals with mutations in region 1, and upper-gastrointestinal manifestations were more severe in them. In individuals with mutations in either region 2 or region 3, the average number of adenomas tended to be lower than those in individuals with mutations in region 1, although age at diagnosis was similar. In all AAPC kindreds, a predominance of right-sided colorectal adenomas and rectal polyp sparing was observed. No desmoid tumors were found in these kindreds. Our data suggest that, in AAPC families, the location of the APC mutation may partially predict specific phenotypic expression. This should help in the design of tailored clinical-management protocols in this subset of FAP patients."
"Low-grade fibrosarcomas and desmoid tumors present a surgical challenge in that they have a strong tendency for local invasion, surgical margins are poorly delineated, and complete resections are difficult. Nowhere is this more evident than in those lesions involving the brachial plexus. We review our experience with these difficult lesions. METHODS: From a prospective database of 2900 patients admitted for treatment of sarcoma between 1982 and 1996, we identified 15 patients with involvement of the brachial plexus by a low-grade fibrosarcoma or desmoid tumor. All patients underwent resection, with 13 of 15 receiving adjuvant radiotherapy. The 15 patients had a mean age at initial operation of 47 years. The male-to-female ratio was 8:7. The mean follow-up period was 65 months (median, 53 mo). RESULTS: Gross total resection was achieved in 12 patients (80%), although 11 of these patients had positive surgical margins. Overall, 64% of the tumors have recurred locally. There were no distant metastases, and no patients died as a result of their disease. One patient died as a result of unrelated cancer. An assessment of the functional outcomes revealed seven patients with normal function or mild neurological deficits and eight who were suffering from significant weakness, debilitation, or chronic pain. One patient required forequarter amputation. CONCLUSION: Surgical resection plus postoperative radiotherapy is the treatment of choice for low-grade fibrosarcomas and desmoid tumors involving the brachial plexus. However, aggressive surgical management with the goal of achieving a gross total resection with negative histological margins can produce unnecessary morbidity. Preserving function should be a primary goal of the operations, although this will be associated with residual disease and will risk local recurrence but rarely death resulting from the disease."
"Little has been written about the specific timing and elements Involved in the follow-up of orthopedic oncology patients. The experience with bone tumor treatment at the First Clinic of the Istituto Rizzoli started 30 years ago and more than 15,000 patients have been treated to date. The increment of limb salvage surgery is linked with the improvements in imaging and surgical skills and with the availability of new reconstructive techniques. For this purpose it is mandatory to carry out meticulous monitoring of the patients. A large number of patients are still followed up to evaluate the results in terms of oncological and functional status. Based on this experience we developed a time schedule to better respond to the need for adequate patient evaluation."

"The study contained herein was undertaken to demonstrate that mesenteric desmoid tumors can cause significant symptoms other than by a mass effect and that surgery can be effective in treating these symptoms. METHODS: The medical records of patients with intra-abdominal desmoid disease in the David G. Jagelman Inherited Colorectal Cancer Registry were reviewed. Four cases are described in which intramesenteric desmoid tumors adjacent to the bowel caused mucosal ischemia in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. RESULTS: In one patient with an ileorectal anastomosis, this was manifest by multiple small-bowel strictures and treated by multiple strictureplasties. The other three patients had ileal pouches and presented with bleeding and pain from mucosal ulceration. All pouches needed to be removed. CONCLUSION: Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors may cause problems other than by mass effect. Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and symptoms suggestive of desmoid disease but with no detectable mass should not be denied surgery."
"Desmoid tumors are fibrotic neoplasms of low metastatic potential. These tumors have long been associated with major laparotomy incisions. However, to the best of our knowledge, they have not been previously associated with laparoscopic trocar placement. This report involves the case of a patient who developed a desmoid tumor at a trocar site. A 35 year-old premenopausal woman presented with an enlarging infraumbilical mass 10 years after a laparoscopic tubal ligation. The mass was immediately subjacent to the skin incision for the laparoscopic procedure. It was approximately 6 cm in diameter and fixed to the underlying abdominal wall. It was evaluated with sonographic and CT imaging, which revealed a solid mass arising from the fascia with no associated hernia. A biopsy of the mass confirmed a diagnosis of a desmoid tumor. This was subsequently excised with a wide margin and reconstructed with Marlex mesh. The patient is without recurrence 2 years following surgery. This case represents what we believe to be the first report of a desmoid tumor arising from a incision made for the placement of a laparoscopic port. Rapidly increasing laparoscopic applications make it likely that these lesions will increase in frequency. In this setting, resection with wide margins remains the mainstay of treatment for desmoid tumors."
"We describe the clinical and pathological features of a case of desmoid tumour of the breast. The lesion was approximately 3.0 cm in greatest dimension. Histologically, it had infiltrating borders and extended to the pectoral muscle. The differential diagnosis is discussed."
We report on a rare case of desmoid tumor in a 40-year-old man with low back pain and cough. There was no history of previous surgery or trauma. MR imaging revealed a posterior mediastinal mass extending into the abdominal cavity.
"A 60-year-old man suffering from cardiac insufficiency consulted the Dermatology Department, Inonu University Turgut Ozal Medical Center, because of a bleeding tumor on his right hypochondrium. The tumor had begun as a small nodule approximately 5 years before, and had grown slowly with time. A small, superficial ulcer had appeared on the lesion approximately 6 months previously, and slight bleeding had occasionally occurred. The patient had no pain and no other complaint except bleeding. Dermatologic examination revealed a violaceous, ulcerated, and bleeding tumoral lesion below the mid-portion of the right costochondral line. The tumor was a non-tender, hemispheric mass, approximately 3-4 cm in size, adherent to the epidermis, but movable on the underlying tissue. An incisional biopsy was performed with diagnoses of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and desmoid tumor. Histopathologic examination revealed prominent blood-filled vascular spaces and clearly delimited cords, showing two types of cell. The vascular spaces contained a periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive, granular, eosinophilic material. There was no malignant transformation. The lesion was totally excised and primarily sutured."
"It is well known that patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are at considerable risk of developing extracolonic manifestations of the disease. Particularly, desmoid tumours of the abdominal cavity, and duodenal adenomas and carcinomas are the most serious ones. It is estimated that some 10% of the FAP patients will develop desmoids, whereas 50-90% of the FAP patients will get duodenal adenomas predominantly concentrated on or around the major papilla. Desmoid tumours and duodenal carcinomas are major causes of death in those patients in whom a prophylactic (procto)colectomy has been performed. Desmoids are histologically benign tumours, composed of mature fibroblasts. They usually grow slowly but they can become quite large and may compress or infiltrate surrounding viscera, which might cause significant morbidity as well as mortality. Successful treatment of these tumours is extremely difficult as surgical therapy often requires the removal of considerable lengths of small bowel. Moreover, surgical therapy may lead to uncontrollable bleeding and is seldom radical. Chemotherapy with cytoxic agents seems promising but so far the data are too few for firm conclusions to be drawn. The same holds true for drug regimens which interfere with the metabolic and hormonal metabolism of the tumour. Although various lines of evidence suggest that the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, which is generally accepted for colorectal adenomas, also applies for the duodenal adenomas in FAP patients, it is not clear whether we should screen these patients for upper gastrointestinal adenomas or not. As these polyps are usually small, sessile, multiple and difficult to remove, the benefit of endoscopic surveillance would be the early detection of cancer rather than eradication of the polyps. In addition, evidence that screening and early treatment leads to improvement of the prognosis is not available. Although the role of (procto)colectomy in the treatment of large-bowel polyps is well established in FAP patients, the treatment of their duodenal counterparts is still open for debate. The risk of the development of periampullary cancer is not high enough to warrant an aggressive prophylactic surgical approach, i.e. a Whipple's procedure, immediately after the discovery of duodenal adenomas. The considerable morbidity and mortality rates of this procedure must be weighted against a putative benefit of screening."
"We present two cases of multifocal desmoid tumors arising in two teenagers. Different, separate lesions developed in the same limb over a period of several years, one of which recurred on several occasions. The literature regarding the therapeutic aspects of multifocal fibromatosis is reviewed and discussed."
"46,XX,add(1)(p36) in 3 of 20 cells analyzed. Since an association of a neoplasm with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy has previously been reported in 3 cases, the two abnormalities are likely related causally. The chromosome abnormality in our patient may play a role in the occurrence of her desmoid tumor."

"To examine prognostic indicators in aggressive fibromatoses that may be used to optimize case-specific management strategy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: One hundred and seven fibromatoses presenting between 1971 and 1992 were analyzed. The following treatment modalities were utilized: (a) surgery alone for 51 tumors; (b) radiation alone for 15 tumors; and (c) radiation and surgery (combined modality) for 41 tumors. Outcome analysis was based on 5-year actuarial local control rates. RESULTS: Control rates among surgery, radiation therapy, and combined modality groups were 69%, 93%, and 72%. Multivariate analysis identified age < 18 years, recurrent disease, positive surgical margins, and treatment with surgery alone as predictors for failure. Patients treated with surgery alone had control rates of 50% (3 of 6) for gross residual, 56% for microscopically positive margins, and 77% for negative margins. Radiation and surgery resulted in rates of 59% for gross residual, 78% for microscopically positive margins, and 100% (6 of 6) for negative margins. For recurrent vs. primary tumors, control was achieved in 48% vs. 77%, 90% vs. 100% (5 of 5), and 67% vs. 79% in the Surgery, Radiation, and Combined modality Groups, respectively. Patients presenting with multiple disease sites tended to have aggressive disease. A radiation dose-control relation to > 60 Gy was seen in patients with unresected or gross residual disease. Of the patients, 23 with disease involving the plantar region had a control rate of 62%, with significantly worse outcomes in children. CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with those found in the relevant literature. They support primary resection with negative margins when feasible. Radiation is a highly effective alternative in situations where surgery would result in major functional or cosmetic defects. When negative surgical margins are not achieved in recurrent tumors, radiation is recommended. Perioperative radiation should be considered in other high-risk groups (recurrent disease, positive margins, and plantar tumors in young patients). Doses of 60-65 Gy for gross disease and 50-60 Gy for microscopic residual are recommended. Observation may be considered for primary tumors with disease remaining in situ when they are located such that progression would not cause significant morbidity. Although plantar lesions in children may represent a group at high risk for recurrence or aggressive behavior, the greater potential for radiation-induced morbidity in this group must also temper its use. Given the inconsistent nature and treatment response of this tumor, it is fundamental that treatment recommendations should be made based on the risk:benefit analysis for the individual patient, dependent on tumor characteristics and location, as well as patient characteristics and preferences."
"We describe 2 patients who presented with fever and incomplete intestinal obstruction. Previously, both patients had had laparotomies showing unresectable lesions in the root of the mesentery which were histologically diagnosed as sclerosing mesenteritis in the first and mesenteric fibromatosis in the second patient. In spite of aggressive immunosuppressive therapy the first patient deteriorated with high-grade fever and progressive weight loss. Similar symptoms occurred in the second patient. Computed tomographic scanning revealed necrotic lesions in both patients which histologically were found to be an angiocentric T-cell lymphoma in the first and a superinfected necrotizing fibroma in the second patient. It is therefore clinically and radiologically impossible to distinguish between the different causes of mesenteric lesions. Reoperation for further biopsies needs to be considered if such patients do not respond to medical treatment."
"Congenital (or infantile) fibrosarcoma (CFS) is a malignant tumour of fibroblasts that occurs in patients aged two years or younger. CFS is unique among human sarcomas in that it has an excellent prognosis and very low metastatic rate. CFS is histologically identical to adult-type fibrosarcoma (ATFS); however, ATFS is an aggressive malignancy of adults and older children that has a poor prognosis. We report a novel recurrent t(12;15)(p13;q25) rearrangement in CFS that may underlie the distinctive biological properties of this tumour. By cloning the chromosome breakpoints, we show that the rearrangement fuses the ETV6 (also known as TEL) gene from 12p13 with the 15q25 NTRK3 neurotrophin-3 receptor gene (also known as TRKC). Analysis of mRNA revealed the expression of ETV6-NTRK3 chimaeric transcripts in all three CFS tumours analysed. These were not detected in ATFS or infantile fibromatosis (IFB), a histologically similar but benign fibroblastic proliferation occurring in the same age-group as CFS. ETV6-NTRK3 fusion transcripts encode the helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein dimerization domain of ETV6 fused to the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) domain of NTRK3. Our studies indicate that a chimaeric PTK is expressed in CFS and this may contribute to oncogenesis by dysregulation of NTRK3 signal transduction pathways. Moreover, ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusions provide a potential diagnostic marker for CFS."
"We describe the functional results in 14 patients (7 men, 7 women) after subtotal scapulectomy for primary bone and soft-tissue tumours at a specialist musculoskeletal oncology unit. Eight had chondrosarcomas, two Ewing's sarcomas, one aggressive fibromatosis and three soft-tissue sarcomas. The mean follow-up was 52 months (6 to 120). Analysis of residual symptoms and of range and strength of movement by physicians used the Musculoskeletal Tumour Society rating scale (MSTS). Physical disability was measured by the patients using the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS). All 14 patients are still alive, two with systemic disease. Nine had more than 80% of their scapula resected but the glenohumeral joint was preserved in all cases. Eight had full movement and another two achieved 90 degrees of flexion. The mean functional results were good to excellent in all except three patients (mean MSTS = 71.6 and TESS = 79.9). Two of these three patients had considerable pain as a result of brachial neuropathy. Scapulectomy gives an excellent functional result if the glenohumeral joint is preserved. The rotator cuff could be removed without a severe functional deficit provided that the deltoid was reattached to the scapular remnant and the trapezius."

"A case of ""aggressive fibromatosis"" which appeared in posterior mediastinum is reported. A 50-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with right shoulder pain. The tumor surrounded the right vertebral artery and infiltrated into the right sympathetic nerve, brachial plexus and muscle tissue. It was suspected of neurogenic tumor by percutaneous needle biopsy. Removal of the tumor and partial resection of the invaded vertebral artery and brachial plexus were made in Aug. 10, 1996. In postoperative examination, the tumor was 6.2 x 6.5 x 4.5 cm in size and diagnosed pathologically as ""aggressive fibromatosis"". Postoperative course was uneventful, but Horner's symptoms and motor disturbances of IV, V, fingers of the right hand were slightly occurred. Radiotherapy of 60 Gy was done after operation. There is no recurrence to date 17 months after surgery. As for the character of this disease, it seldom metastasizes, but grows infiltratively and the recurrence after operation is an important problem. In particular, the neck and the head are important because surgical margin is not provided enough, anatomically. Therefore, chemotherapy or radiotherapy after operation is needed. In this case, radiotherapy was done after operation. So, there is not the recurrence and passes to date 17 months after surgery. But, follow-up of long terms is necessary because it may recur after postoperative therapies."
"Germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene are responsible for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal dominant predisposition to the formation of multiple colorectal adenomas. Moreover, patients with FAP are at high risk of developing several extracolonic manifestations, including desmoids, cutaneous cysts, and tumors of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Although by definition desmoids are nonmalignant, because of their aggressive invasion of local structures, they represent one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality among patients with FAP. METHODS: This study describes the histopathologic and molecular characterization of Apc1638N, a mouse model for the broad spectrum of extracolonic manifestations characteristic of FAP. RESULTS: Heterozygous Apc+/Apc1638N animals develop fully penetrant and multifocal cutaneous follicular cysts and desmoid tumors in addition to attenuated polyposis of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, breeding of Apc+/Apc1638N mice in a p53-deficient background results in a dramatic seven-fold increase of the desmoid multiplicity. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the attenuated nature of their intestinal phenotype, these mice survive longer than other murine models for Apc-driven tumorigenesis. Therefore, Apc1638N represents an ideal laboratory tool to test various therapeutic intervention strategies for the management of intestinal as well as extraintestinal tumors."
"Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) presenting in the pleura and other soft tissue sites and hemangiopericytoma (HPC) presenting at various soft tissue sites are mesenchymal tumors that share many histologic and immunohistochemical features. This raises the questions of whether these tumors are related and whether they belong within the spectrum of a single biologic entity. The behavior of both SFTs and HPCs is difficult to predict histologically. The genetic background of both SFTs and HPCs is poorly known, but it could be helpful in the evaluation of malignancy and could give clues to their possible relationship. In this study, we analyzed 15 SFTs and 11 HPCs by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), a powerful molecular cytogenetic tool that can be applied to DNA extracted from formaldehyde-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue. All of these tumors were immunohistochemically similar and showed reactivity for CD34-antigen but not for keratins, desmin, or muscle actins. Only 1 SFT smaller than 10 cm showed DNA copy number changes (a single loss in chromosome 13), but 7 of 8 SFTs larger than 10 cm (including all 4 tumors with more than 4 mitoses per 10 high power fields) showed changes, mostly chromosomal gains in 5q 7, 8, 12, and 18. Four cases showed losses, two of them in chromosome 13 and two others in 20q. These findings suggest that CGH might be useful in the evaluation of malignant transformation in SFT. The most common change, gain of the entire chromosome 8, seen in two cases as the only change, suggests trisomy 8 and parallels a similar finding previously described in other fibrous tumors, such as subsets of desmoid fibromatosis and infantile fibrosarcoma. In contrast, HPCs, including large and mitotically active tumors, showed no DNA copy number changes on CGH. This suggests that HPC is genetically different from SFT."
"Desmoid tumors are the second leading cause of mortality in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis who have undergone proctocolemy. Both medical and surgical treatment of these non-metastasizing but locally aggressive tumors are difficult. CASE REPORT: A 20-years-old woman consulted 6 years after coloproctectomy for familial adenomatous polyposis. A mesenteric desmoid tumor was found. Resection was not possible. The tumor progressed under sulindac treatment and subocclusion developed. The patient was given tamoxifen, 20 mg/d and the size of the tumor began to regress within a few days together with pain and signs of compression. The treatment was well tolerated for 4.5 years and tumor volume has remained unchanged after a 20-fold reduction compared with the size prior to treatment. The patient has remained symptom-free. DISCUSSION: In this critical clinical situation, tamoxifen provided rapid and prolonged effect and was well tolerated."
"We report on a 23-year-old woman with a poorly differentiated synovial sarcoma on the palm of her hand which presented as a painless nodule. The MRI findings are presented along with the clinical and pathologic features. Because of similar morphological features, these tumors can be confused with benign lesions such as aggressive fibromatosis or ganglion cysts, especially when very small. The possibility of a synovial sarcoma mimicking a benign lesion needs to be considered when the mass does not have an unequivocal benign diagnosis on MR imaging. Following wide resection and reconstruction, our patient has been disease free with good function for 28 months."
We report a new case of aggressive juvenile fibromatosis (FJA) in a 20 months old girl. It was initially treated by hemimandibulectomy. A secondary reconstruction was performed with a fibular flap at the age of 9 years. FJA is a locally aggressive lesion which does not metastasize. It occurs chiefly in girls during childhood. Radiographs are non-specific (extensive osteolytic lesion). The clinicopathologic diagnosis is discussed with the other mandibular fibrous tumors in children.
"Seven-week-old Apc1638N mice were exposed to a single dose of 5 Gy total-body X-irradiation resulting in a 8-fold increase in the number of intestinal tumors and a reduction of the lifespan to an average of 6 months. The distribution of tumors along the intestinal tract as well as the adenoma/carcinoma ratio, were similar between non-irradiated and irradiated animals. Semi-quantitative PCR analysis of intestinal-tumor DNA revealed that 10 out of 14 tumors had lost the wild-type Apc allele. However, in contrast to spontaneous Apc1638N intestinal tumors in which the LOH event at the Apc locus involves the entire chromosome 18 (1), in 6 out of 10 tumors derived from X-irradiated animals the Apc loss is associated with only a partial intrachromosomal deletion. The remaining tumors have lost all chromosome 18 markers tested. In addition to the intestinal tumors, female Apc1638N mice are susceptible to the development of mammary tumors. Upon X-irradiation, Apc1638N mice show a striking 15-fold increase in mammary tumors. Moreover, Apc1638N mice spontaneously develop other extra-intestinal neoplasia, such as desmoid-like lesions similar to those associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the human syndrome caused by germline mutations in the APC gene. Spontaneous desmoid growth is sex-dependent, as male Apc1638N mice develop 3-fold more desmoids than female mice. Interestingly, X-irradiation seemed to increase the number of desmoids per animal nearly twofold only in female Apc1638N mice. Five out of 9 desmoids found in Apc1638N mice exposed to X-ray displayed loss of the wild-type Apc allele."
"Recurrence of desmoid tumours is difficult to predict from only histological findings. In this study, immunohistochemistry for counting stromal blood vessels and proliferative activity, DNA flow cytometry, and interphase cytogenetic analysis of chromosome 8 by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) were performed to assess the correlation between their parameters and the recurrence of desmoid tumours. METHODS AND RESULTS: The cases examined included 16 extra-abdominal desmoid and eight abdominal desmoids, comprising 14 recurrent and 10 non-recurrent cases. Eleven (69%) of the 16 extra-abdominal desmoids and three (38%) of the eight abdominal desmoids recurred. Patients with recurrent lesions (mean age, 20 years) were younger than those with non-recurrent tumours (34 years). Histologically, tumours with hypervascular areas frequently recurred after surgery in comparison with those with hypovascularity. There was no significant correlation between tumour size, the labelling index of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and the recurrence. In flow cytometric analysis, all the cases examined showed a diploid pattern. The FISH study revealed that the incidence of trisomy 8 was significantly higher in the recurrent (72.7%) than in the non-recurrent cases (12.5%). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a subgroup of desmoid tumours at risk of recurrence may be hypervascular lesions associated with trisomy 8."
"A case of sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma and its appearance on MRI is presented. The tumor showed a zonal architecture on MRI with a large central core of very low signal intensity and a peripheral rim of intermediate to high signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted spin echo pulse sequences. The core showed decreased cellularity with dense collagen deposition on histologic examination, and the peripheral zone increased cellularity with increased nuclear atypia. The presence of a prominent region of very low signal intensity on T1- and T2- weighted images can be seen with neural tumors, giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath, aggressive fibromatosis, and, in rare instances, with soft tissue sarcomas rich in collagen."
"The purpose of this study is to evaluate cytologically two cases of mammary fibromatosis (MF). Prior to FNAC, clinical and mammographic suspicion of carcinoma and fibroadenoma were present. In both cases cytology disclosed the presence of numerous spindle cells admixed with epithelial cells. In the first case, carcinoma was excluded and the diagnosis of ""spindle-cell proliferative lesion"" was established. The second case was erroneously diagnosed as ""cellular fibroadenoma"" due to the presence of monolayered ductal epithelial groups and stromal tissue. In both cases local excision of the lesion was recommended. Although in a strict sense fibromatosis is a pure stromal lesion, the frequent presence of epithelial groups in the smears should raise a differential diagnosis with other more frequent mixed (epithelial and stromal) lesions such as fibroadenoma, cystosarcoma phyllodes, and metaplastic carcinoma. Due to the fact that clinically and mamographically MF is frequently confused with malignancy, preoperative recognition is essential since in many cases it would avoid unnecessary radical surgery. In this sense cytology offers very important preoperative information."
"Desmoid tumors have a high propensity for local recurrence with surgical resection. There are many reports describing good responses of desmoid tumors to irradiation, but none have clearly established the indications for adjuvant radiotherapy in treating resectable desmoid tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 61 patients with resectable desmoid tumor(s) who were treated at our institution from 1965 to February of 1992. Five patients had multifocal disease and are analyzed separately. Fifty-six patients had unifocal disease, of which 34 had positive surgical margins. Forty-five of the 56 patients with unifocal disease were treated with surgery alone, while 11 were treated with surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy. Median follow-up was 6 years. Local control was measured from the last day of treatment, and all cases were reviewed by our Department of Pathology. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis of the 56 patients with unifocal disease revealed that positive margins independently predicted for local recurrence (p < or = 0.01). Only 3 of 22 patients with clear margins experienced a local recurrence, with a 6-year actuarial local control of 85%. Multivariate analysis of the 34 patients with positive margins revealed that adjuvant radiotherapy independently predicted for improved local control (p = 0.01), and patients with recurrent disease had a slightly higher risk of local recurrence (p = 0.08). The 6-year actuarial local control determined by Kaplan-Meier for patients with unifocal disease and positive margins was 32% (+/-12%) with surgery alone, and 78% (+/-14%) with surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy (p = 0.02). Subgroup analysis of the patients with positive margins and recurrent disease revealed that those treated with surgery alone had a 6-year actuarial local control of 0% vs. 80% for those treated with surgery plus radiotherapy (p < or = 0.01). Patients with positive margins and primary disease had a trend towards improved local control with adjuvant radiotherapy, but this was not statistically significant. None of the patients treated with radiotherapy developed serious complications or a secondary malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: Margin status is the most important predictor of local recurrence for patients with resectable, unifocal desmoid tumor. Adjuvant radiotherapy is indicated in the treatment of patients with positive margins following wide excision of recurrent disease. The role of adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with positive margins following resection of primary disease is controversial, and should be based on a balanced discussion of the potential morbidity from radiotherapy compared to the potential morbidity of another local recurrence. Adjuvant radiotherapy is less likely to benefit those with clear margins due to the excellent results for these patients treated with surgery alone. The local control of desmoid tumor in the adjuvant setting is excellent with total doses ranging from 50-60 Gy, with acceptable morbidity. Field sizes should be generous to prevent marginal recurrences, and large volume MRIs of patients with extremity lesions should be used to identify those patients with multifocal disease."
We present a case of aggressive fibromatosis of the scalene and longus colli muscles with surgically proved secondary involvement of the brachial plexus and carotid sheath in a 29-year-old woman in whom MR imaging failed to show involvement of the carotid sheath. The well-defined lesion was isointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images relative to adjacent normal muscle and enhanced brightly.
"The objective of this study was to evaluate the appearance and the natural evolution of desmoid tumors on MR imaging, given histologic correlation. The MR images of 30 desmoids (20 primary and 10 recurrent) in 26 patients were scored for a multiplicity of morphological parameters, signal intensity (SI) on different pulse sequences, and behavior after contrast administration. Natural evolution was evaluated in 2 primary and 3 recurrent lesions, and correlated with evolution on histologic specimens. Desmoid tumors are mostly found in muscles of shoulder and hip girdle and are often fusiform with partially ill-defined margins. Rare subcutaneous desmoids have a more stellar morphology. Variable amounts of low-SI areas are present on all sequences. On T1-weighted images (T1-WI), most lesions are near homogeneous and isointense to muscle, whereas on T2-WI they are more heterogeneous with an overall SI equal to or slightly lower than fat. Histologic correlation reveals that SI on T2-WI cannot be explained solely by cellularity. After initial growth, spontaneous evolution of desmoids is characterized by shrinking and an increase in low-SI areas on T2-WI. While distal lesions shrink, the more recent lesions in asynchronous multicentric desmoids have a tendency to develop proximally in the same limb, and should not be confused with recurrences. Fast growth, extracompartmental spread, and bone involvement are often seen in recurrences. Follow-up MR imaging of desmoids indicates natural regression of desmoids and more aggressive behavior of recurrences, which may justify a more conservative therapeutic approach."
"We reported a case of twenty-two years old woman who underwent seventh operation for recurrent desmoid tumor of posterior area of the lower zone of the left chest wall. For complete resection of the tumor, wide resection of the chest wall including 6th to 12th ribs was done. We used autobone grafts at the tumor site to reconstruct her bony thorax. The sixth, seventh, and ninth ribs were used as pasteurized autogenous bone grafts; they were heated in water at 60 degrees C for 30 minutes then cool, and replaced to the bony thoracic area. Her postoperative state was good and no complication was observed. Pasteurization process makes tumor tissue necrotic, and pasteurized bone has osteoinductive activity and have mechanical strength similar as that of fresh bone graft. So, we concluded that pasteurized autogenous bone grafting may be a useful method for chest wall reconstruction."
"Sporadic aggressive fibromatosis (also called desmoid tumor) is a monoclonal proliferation of spindle (fibrocyte-like) cells that is locally invasive but does not metastasize. A similarity to abdominal fibromatoses (desmoids) in familial adenomatous polyposis and a cytogenetic study showing partial deletion of 5q in a subset of aggressive fibromatoses suggests that the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene plays a role in its pathogenesis. APC helps regulate the cellular level of beta-catenin, which is a downstream mediator in Wnt (Wingless) signaling. beta-Catenin has a nuclear function (binds transcription factors) and a cell membrane function (is a component of epithelial cell adherens junctions). Six cases of aggressive fibromatosis of the extremities from patients without familial adenomatous polyposis, or a family history of colon cancer, were studied. Immunohistochemistry, using carboxy and amino terminus antibodies to APC, and DNA sequencing showed that three of the six contained an APC-truncating mutation, whereas normal tissues did not contain a mutation. Western blot and Northern dot blot showed that all six tumors had a higher level of beta-catenin protein than surrounding normal tissues, despite containing similar levels of beta-catenin mRNA. Immunohistochemistry localized beta-catenin throughout the cell in tumor tissues, although it localized more to the periphery in cells from normal tissues. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that the tumors expressed N-cadherin but not E-cadherin (a pattern of expression of proteins making up adherens junctions similar to fibrocytes), suggesting that the specific adherens junctions present in epithelial cells are not necessary for beta-catenin function. Increased beta-catenin may cause the growth advantage of cells in this tumor through a nuclear mechanism. The increased protein level, relative to the RNA level, suggests that beta-catenin is degraded at a lower rate compared with normal tissues. In some cases, this is caused by a somatic mutation resulting in a truncated APC protein."
"In reflection of a current case, the latest literature concerning recurring infantile digital fibromatosis (Reye's tumour) are summed up. It is a non-malignant, rarely encountered tumour observed in children, appearing on the hands and feet. The tumour is almost exclusively diagnosed before the age of three. The etiology is unknown. Approximately 100 cases have been reported in the literature. Eosinophilic inclusion bodies near the nucleus of the tumourcells are pathognomonic. According to the latest literature, the content of the inclusions is mostly actin filaments between which the formed elements of the cell are entrapped. Previous treatment was repeated excision of the recurring tumours, until spontaneous cessation of disease activity. According to the latest literature, a more conservative treatment is recommended, because the fibromas often regress spontaneously over few years. Therefore surgical treatment is only needed in rare cases with aggressive or uncontrollable growth of the fibromas."
"Antiestrogens and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs have been shown to be effective in adult patients with unresectable or recurrent desmoid tumors. It appears that the growth of these tumors is influenced by estrogen, and that antiestrogen treatment may inhibit further proliferation of tumor cells. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are thought to be effective through their interference with prostaglandin metabolism. METHODS: Two children with unresectable desmoid tumors (aggressive fibromatosis) were treated with tamoxifen (1 mg/kg orally, twice daily) and diclofenac (2 mg/kg rectally, twice daily). RESULTS: At last follow-up, tumor regression and growth arrest were maintained for more than 51 months in 1 child with rapidly growing recurrent fibromatosis of the thoracic wall. Another child with an inoperable desmoid tumor of the submandibular region had stable disease since the initiation of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report describing this treatment approach in childhood fibromatosis. Combined therapy with endocrine therapy and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may be a nonaggressive alternative to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the treatment of children with inoperable desmoid tumors."

"To clarify the clinical risk of desmoid tumors developing in familial adenomatous polyposis, we reviewed the cases of 49 Japanese patients diagnosed with familial adenomatous polyposis at our institute. In six patients who manifested desmoid tumors at a mean age of 31 years, we reviewed the clinical features and compared various phenotypic manifestations with those in the 43 patients without desmoid tumors. During the observation periods (mean, 6.5 years), two of six patients with desmoid tumors died because of the tumors, which measured > 10 cm in diameter at the initial diagnosis, whereas the remaining four patients with desmoid tumors < 5 cm did not experience complications. The patients with desmoid tumors tended to be women (5 of 6 vs. 17 of 43; p = 0.05) and more frequently had gastric fundic gland polyposis (5 of 6 vs. 17 of 43; p = 0.05) than did the patients without desmoid tumors. There were no apparent differences in other clinical manifestations, including the incidences of colonic polyposis, gastroduodenal adenomas, and extraintestinal tumors. Desmoid tumors can be serious complication in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. There may be some association in the genesis of desmoid tumors and gastric fundic gland polyposis."
"Infantile fibromatosis, one of the fibrous tumours of infancy and childhood, is a fibroproliferative lesion characterized by aggressive local invasion without any tendency to metastasize, the absence of cytological evidence of malignancy and a high rate of local recurrence when incompletely excised. We report a case of infantile (desmoid-type) fibomatosis in a seven-year-old girl arising from the deep lobe of the parotid gland that was treated by complete surgical excision with preservation of the facial nerve. The clinical features, pathology and treatment are briefly discussed."
"From January 1980 to December 1993, 52 patients underwent surgical-resection for tumors involving the sternum. The series included 20 primary malignant tumors, 4 desmoid tumors, 2 malignant tumors infiltrating the sternum from adjacent organs, 19 local recurrences or metastases of breast tumors, and 7 metastases of other tumors. Total sternectomy was performed in 5 patients, subtotal sternal resection in 19, and partial resection (less than 50% of the sternum) in 28. Concurrent en bloc resection included anterior ribs in 37 patients, clavicle in 11, lung in 12 patients, pericardium in 7, and diaphragm in 2. The chest was reconstructed with prosthetic material and a myocutaneous flap in 26 patients (50%), prosthetic material only in 12 patients (23%), a myocutaneous flap in 5 patients (10%), and other techniques in the remaining patients. In 47 patients (90%) the resection was radical, and in the remaining 5 patients it was palliative. RESULTS: No perioperative deaths occurred. After a median follow-up of 39 months, the overall 3-year survival was 58% and the 5-year survival 46%, with a median survival of 50 months. In 24 patients with primary tumor the 5-year survival after radical resection was 63%, and in 23 patients with secondary invasion (direct extension or metastasis) the 5-year survival was 38% (median 35 months). In recurrent breast cancer the 5-year survival was 48% in patients with direct extension to the chest wall and 60% in patients with distant bone metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience demonstrates that sternal resection is a safe and effective treatment, which may improve the patient's quality of life and achieve a long-term survival not only in primary tumors but also in selected secondary malignant tumors of the sternum."
"This study was designed to assess the effect of chemotherapy on complex desmoid tumors associated with familial adenomatous polyposis. METHODS: Five patients (3 males, 2 females; age range, 29-45 years) had symptomatic, unresectable intra-abdominal desmoid tumors in association with familial adenomatous polyposis that were unresponsive to conventional medical therapy. Each patient was treated with a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic regimen consisting of doxorubicin and dacarbazine followed by carboplatin and dacarbazine. Response to treatment was assessed by measurement of tumor size using computerized tomography. Follow-up has been for a mean of 22 (range, 10-30) months. RESULTS: One patient has had a complete response, and three patients have had a partial response, with a reduction in tumor volume of at least 50 percent. One patient had a minimum response to treatment and developed a rapid increase in tumor size on cessation of therapy. Complications of treatment included febrile neutropenia, severe epistaxis, and subclavian vein thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: The cytotoxic chemotherapeutic regimen described is effective in the treatment of selected unresectable desmoid tumors associated with familial adenomatous polyposis and should be considered in symptomatic patients who do not respond to conventional medical therapy."
"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is caused by mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, and different mutations may produce different clinical pictures. Most mutations occur in the 5' half of the gene, and mutations toward the 3' end are rare. The aim of this study was to document the phenotypes in a family with a truncating mutation at codons 1982-1983, one of the most 3' mutations on record. Colonic polyps in this family were much less numerous, and their growth was delayed compared with the classical FAP picture, and malignant degeneration occurred considerably later. Two individuals had sparse colonic but profuse gastric fundic gland polyposis. Gardner's syndrome stigmata were variable, and a desmoid tumor was recorded in 1 person."
"The authors determined the flow cytometric (FCM) DNA characteristics of 53 benign tumors and 132 malignant (71 primary, 61 recurrent) soft tissue sarcomas to investigate their heterogeneity and to evaluate the prognostic values of DNA ploidy status and S-phase fraction (SPF). METHODS: One to 11 frozen samples were collected from 185 tumors at 10 participating centers of the French Federation of Cancer Centers (FNCLCC). All FCM analyses were performed in the same laboratory. Histologic diagnoses were collegially reviewed, and grade was assessed by the pathologists of the FNCLCC Sarcoma Group. Relationships between FCM, clinical, and pathologic data were investigated using univariate and multivariate analyses for risks of mortality and metastasis. RESULTS: All except 2 of the 53 benign lesions were DNA diploid. One schwannoma and one desmoid tumor exhibited small abnormal DNA peaks. SPF was low in all benign lesions. One-third of the sarcomas were DNA diploid, whereas two-thirds were DNA aneuploid. Relationships were found between aneuploidy and mitotic count, grade, and histologic subtype of malignant fibrous histiocytoma. DNA ploidy status did not influence the clinical outcome. Multiple sampling performed in 32 sarcomas showed both diploid and aneuploid samples in 6 tumors. Heterogeneity was related to tumor size. SPF evaluated in 85 sarcomas was related to DNA ploidy status, mitotic count, and grade. SPF > or = 4% was significantly associated with a low overall survival rate. In a multivariate analysis performed for the whole group of 132 patients, the single factors with independent prognostic value for patient mortality were disease free status after the treatment course (P < 0.0001) and SPF (P = 0.03). In the subgroup of patients who were initially free of metastases and free of tumor after the treatment course, SPF remained the only factor that significantly influenced the overall survival rate (P = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS: Despite its high failure rate, SPF is an independent factor in the prognosis of soft tissue sarcoma and should be considered when patients with a high mortality risk need to be selected for adjuvant chemotherapy."
"A review of the literature of the last 5 years on retroperitoneal fibrosis is given. MRT seems to add to the exact extend of the disease and galliumscintigraphy can give new information on the activity of the process and the usefulness of medical therapy. The use of corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive drugs such a azathioprine, again is confirmed. Other drugs mentioned in the medical therapy are methotrexate, cyclophosfamide and penicillamine. A few cases responded well to tamoxifen, a drug which was already used in therapy of desmoid tumours. Medical treatment is anyhow superior to surgery alone."
"Isolated limb perfusion (ILP) with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) +/-interferon gamma (IFN gamma) and melphalan in patients with primarily irresectable soft tissue sarcoma is promising in terms of tumor regression and limb salvage. However, the feasibility of radiotherapy in combination with this treatment modality has not been established. METHODS: Fifteen patients with irresectable soft tissue tumors of the limb underwent ILP with TNF alpha, +/-IFN gamma, and melphalan. Three groups could be distinguished with respect to the role of radiotherapy. In nine patients, the residual tumor could be resected after ILP, and this was followed by radiotherapy with a total dose of 50-70 Gy (2 Gy/day). In one patient with aggressive fibromatosis, ILP was followed by radiotherapy without tumor resection (Group I). In two patients who underwent ILP for recurrent sarcoma, the primary tumor had been treated before by resection and radiotherapy (60 Gy) (Group II). In three patients whose tumors remained irresectable after ILP, radiotherapy was applied later in the course of disease for local palliation (Group III). RESULTS: In Group I, healing of the resection wound was markedly delayed in four patients, with soft tissue necrosis and infection necessitating amputation in two of them. Following completion of radiotherapy, persistent lymphoceles were encountered in two patients. Radiotherapy-induced fibrosis was encountered in five patients, resulting in a mild limb malfunction in two. Three-patients developed mild edema during radiotherapy. Tumor-associated neuropathy was aggravated by ILP in three patients causing severely disabling motor deficits and limb contractures in two of them. In Group II, ILP did not cause any local problem in the heavily irradiated areas. In Group III, pre-existing limb edema was increased after a total palliative dose of 20 Gy in one patient. Another patient, who had been re-operated for arterial thrombosis immediately after ILP, developed occlusion of the brachial artery 4 months after completion of palliative radiotherapy (36 Gy in 6 Gy fractions). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with irresectable soft tissue tumors, multimodality treatment using ILP with TNF alpha +/- IFN gamma and melphalan, tumor resection, and postoperative high-dose radiotherapy is associated with a considerable risk of tissue necrosis and impaired healing. This risk should be weighed against a possible benefit from radiotherapy in local tumor control."
"External beam irradiation (PBRT), especially in children, is limited by the radiosensitivity of normal tissues. Local control remains a problem in abdominopelvic childhood malignancies. Intraoperative electron irradiation (IOERT) has the potential to increase the dose to the tumor, thereby improving local control, without increasing treatment morbidity. METHODS: Between February 1983 and October 1990, 11 children received IOERT as part of a multidisciplinary treatment program for locally advanced primary or recurrent abdominopelvic malignancies. The 7 boys and 4 girls ranged in age from 2-18 years. Tumor histologies included four neuroblastomas, two desmoid tumors, and one each of the following: embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial cell sarcoma, neurofibrosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and paraganglioma. Single radiation doses of 10-25 grays were delivered using 6-15-megaelectron volt electron beams to 1-5 IOERT fields. All patients also underwent EBRT and six received chemotherapy. RESULTS: Eight patients (73%) were alive and disease free at a median follow-up of 99 months (range, 37-126 months). All eight patients who underwent gross total resection were locally controlled. Three patients required surgical intervention for IOERT-related complications and two patients developed neuropathies. CONCLUSIONS: IOERT as part of a multidisciplinary treatment approach in patients with locally advanced pediatric malignancies appears to enhance local control in those patients in whom a gross total resection is possible. The long term survival rate was encouraging. Further study, with a larger number of patients, appears warranted to more carefully delineate the efficacy and tolerance of IOERT in the pediatric population."
"Clinical and experimental evidence suggest that estrogen has a role in the natural history of desmoid tumor (DT) and colorectal carcinoma. METHODS: The biological effects of LY117018, a nonsteroidal antiestrogen benzothiophene derivative, were assessed on a human adenocarcinoma cell line (HCT8 cells), and on DT cells and colorectal cancer derived fibroblasts in primary culture. RESULTS: LY117018 inhibited cell proliferation and collagen type I synthesis in DT cells. The compound also reduced cell growth in HCT8 cells and colorectal cancer fibroblasts. Binding experiments revealed the presence of estrogen binding sites in DT cells and frozen tissues but LY117018 did not displace [3H]17 beta E2 binding to DT cells. CONCLUSIONS: Present results demonstrate that LY117018 inhibits epithelial and fibroblastic colon cancer cells proliferation and proliferation and differentiation of desmoid cells in vitro. The lack of displacement of [3H]17 beta E2 binding to desmoid cells by LY117018 suggests the existence of distinct LY117018 binding sites."

"Extra-abdominal desmoid tumor is a locally aggressive neoplasm that occurs most commonly in the pelvic or shoulder region in the third or fourth decade. We have identified one previously reported case of primary desmoid tumor of the vulva. Herein, we describe another case and, to our knowledge, the first reported case of vulvar desmoid tumor associated with pregnancy."
"Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is a rare autosomal recessive connective tissue disease first described in 1873 by Murray. Major diagnostic criteria are multiple cutaneous tumors and gingival hypertrophy; minor criteria include contractures, osteolytic lesions and a positive family history. After a normal perinatal period at the age of 6 months our 24 year old patient developed gingival hypertrophy. During the first months of life several skin coloured nodules had been noticed on the neck and in the perianal area. At the age of 15 months, these nodules began to appear more rapidly, both spontaneously and posttraumatically. The patient showed normal development, but the lesions progressed. By the age of 15 years, the patient had extensive deformities and was unable to walk and move by himself. Both his sisters and the unrelated parents had no lesions. Essential for the diagnosis are the clinical picture and the histology. Electron microscopy is helpful to support the diagnosis. Defective connective tissue proteins such as chondroitin, collagen and mucopolysaccharides are probably the pathological defect. A therapy is so far unknown."
"We present a case of massive thoraco-cervical fibromatosis treated by sternotomy and simple excision. The patient remains disease-free after careful follow-up of three years. We suggest that if the lesion is encapsulated and position or size prevents en bloc removal, simple excision may be curative."
"Desmoid tumor of the breast is a clinician's dilemma as it is difficult to differentiate it from carcinoma clinically, mammographically, and cytologically. Histologically, it must be distinguished from fibrosarcoma. Current management favors wide excision with clear margins. Recurrence is relatively common and usually occurs within 3 years of excision. Adjuvant hormonal therapy does not reduce local recurrence rates; evidence indicates that postoperative radiotherapy can improve the 10-year recurrence-free survival rate."
"some evidence suggests that it is a reactive process, whereas other evidence supports a neoplastic etiology. The pattern of X chromosome inactivation, using a technique based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a hypervariable CAG repeat region flanking Hhal restriction sites of the human androgen receptor gene, was determined in four cases in which cryopreserved tumor and adjacent normal tissue were available. All four tumors demonstrated a monoclonal pattern, while the adjacent normal tissues demonstrated a polyclonal pattern. This demonstrates that aggressive fibromatosis is proliferation of cells derived from a single clone with a growth advantage, and thus is likely a neoplastic process."
"Recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (rTNF-alpha) is a highly potential antineoplastic agent. However, its systemic administration in humans has resulted in a life-threatening septic shock-like syndrome, and its use has been abandoned. The administration of high dose rTNF-alpha and melphalan via isolated limb perfusion (ILP) eliminated the systemic side effects and was shown to be very effective for metastatic melanoma confined to the limb. The purpose of the current study was to assess the role of rTNF-alpha and melphalan administered via ILP in patients with soft tissue sarcoma. Amputation is unavoidable in 10% of these patients despite aggressive conventional therapy. Limb preservation was the objective in this select group of candidates for amputation or mutilating surgery. METHODS: During a 36-month period, 35 patients with high grade soft tissue sarcoma underwent 41 ILPs with high dose rTNF-alpha (3-4 mg) and melphalan (1-1.5 mg/kg). There were 21 males and 14 females. The mean age was 48 years (range, 14-80 years). Histologic subtypes included malignant fibrous histiocytoma, synovial, liposarcoma, malignant schwannoma, desmoid, clear cell, epithelioid, rhabdomyosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and unclassifiable. Twenty-one patients presented with recurrent and 14 with very extensive primary tumors. The tumors were located in the upper extremity in 8 patients and in the lower extremity in 27 patients. Twenty-five patients were candidates for amputation and 10 for extensive mutilating surgery. ILP was performed via the corresponding vessels proximal to the tumor. Six patients with partial response (PR) insufficient to render them resectable underwent a second ILP. With the exception of 4 of 9 patients with multifocal lesions and 1 who refused surgery, resection of the residual tumor or tumor bed or limb was performed 6-8 weeks after ILP. RESULTS: Marked tumor softening occurred within 48 hours, and in tumors protruding through the skin hemorrhagic necrosis was evident within 24 hours. The overall response rate was 91%. Thirteen patients (37%) had a complete response and 19 (54%) had a PR; in 5 of these patients > 90% necrosis of the tumor occurred. In 3 patients (8.5%), only minimal regression was observed (stabilization of disease). The rate of limb sparing was 85% (29 of 34 patients). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of high dose rTNF-alpha and melphalan given via ILP appears to be effective in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma confined to the limb, achieving a high response rate and limb preservation."
"Desmoid tumor is a locally aggressive, nonmetastasizing soft tissue tumor. Whether desmoid tumor is a truly neoplastic cellular proliferative process or, alternatively, an unchecked reactive process has been a subject of debate. In order to determine whether desmoid tumor is composed of a clonal cell population as opposed to being a polyclonal reactive process, analysis of patterns of X-chromosome inactivation was performed. Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed tissues were microdissected to obtain both lesional and normal control samples, and the genomic DNAs were extracted by proteinase K digestion. Following treatment with methylation sensitive restriction endonuclease (Hha I or Hpa II), the genomic DNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using nested primers targeted to a highly polymorphic short tandem repeat (STR) of the human androgen receptor (HUMARA). In eight of 12 cases, PCR amplification of the genomic DNAs was successful, and all eight of the amplified cases were heterozygous in the size of the HUMARA target. The remaining cases could not be studied because of failure to amplify DNA. Following digestion with HhaI or Hpa II, uniform patterns of X-chromosome inactivation were found in all eight desmoid tumors, whereas normal control tissue remained heterozygous. These results confirm a clonal composition of the tumors. The demonstration of clonality in the tumors in all eight informative cases indicates that desmoid tumor is a true neoplastic process, not an unchecked polyclonal reactive process."
"Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by congenital malformation of the great toes and progressive heterotopic ossification in distinct anatomic patterns. Early preosseous lesions in FOP are clinically and histologically indistinguishable from the lesions of aggressive juvenile fibromatosis (AJF). Although the genetic defect in FOP is unknown, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 2 and 4 are plausible candidates genes. To determine if there is a difference in BMP 2/4 expression in the early fibromatous lesions of the two conditions, we performed immunohistochemical studies with a monoclonal antibody to BMP 2/4 on the earliest detectable fibromatous lesions of FOP and compared them with histologically identical lesions resected from children who had AJF. Fibromatous cells from the early FOP lesions exhibited immunostaining for BMP 2/4, whereas histologically indistinguishable fibromatous cells from AJF lesions showed no evidence of BMP 2/4 immunostaining. It is incumbent on all physicians who treat patients with suspected fibromatosis to examine the toes to rule out FOP and to avoid unnecessary diagnostic biopsies because surgical trauma induces further bone formation in patients who have FOP. However, if diagnostic confusion still exists and a biopsy is performed, immunostaining with BMP 2/4 antibody may resolve the diagnostic dilemma between FOP and AJF before the appearance of heterotopic ossification is observed in the FOP lesions. Our data suggest that the BMP 2/4 subfamily of secreted proteins may be involved in the pathogenesis of the FOP lesions."

"A 20-year-old man with a large, asymptomatic mediastinal mass was found to have desmoid-type fibromatosis (DF) by needle biopsy. The tumor arose from the internal periosteum of the sternum and mimicked an anterior mediastinal mass. A wide resection of the sternum, including portions of the clavicles and costal cartilages, and reconstruction with a Gore-Tex soft tissue patch were performed. Although extremely rare, desmoid tumor of the sternum should be considered in the differential diagnosis of anterior mediastinal tumors."
"There are no specific MRI features which are diagnostic in bone and soft tissue sarcomas, but a combination of certain findings allows an accurate diagnosis in some cases including giant cell tumour, chondrosarcoma, liposarcoma, neurofibrosarcoma, aggressive fibromatosis and pigmented villonodular synovitis. MRI is the method of choice for staging bone and soft tissue sarcomas. It is of particular use for identifying satellite nodules and skip lesions within the same bone or anatomical compartment. CT scan is important for screening for pulmonary metastases, and bone scan remains useful for screening for distant skeletal disease. The biopsy should be planned and performed after any MRI examination. MRI is the most sensitive post-therapy evaluation for local recurrence of bone and soft tissue sarcoma."
"Tamoxifen has been used most commonly to treat breast and endometrial cancer, two malignancies in which the antiestrogenic properties of tamoxifen have substantial therapeutic benefit. However, tamoxifen has been used in the treatment of other cancers as well, some in which an antiestrogen may be effective, but others in which estrogen receptor is not expressed. In estrogen receptor-negative cancers, tamoxifen has been shown to have therapeutic activity at doses approximately fourfold to eightfold above those used for estrogen receptor inhibition. It is thought that the primary mechanism of tamoxifen in estrogen-negative tumors is inhibition of protein kinase C. Clinical trials of tamoxifen in ovarian cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, desmoid tumors, malignant glioma, pancreatic carcinoma, melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma are reviewed."
"vertebral body, subclavian vessels, first rib). Among the various techniques proposed, the anterior trans-cervical approach popularized by Dartevelle significantly improved the radical treatment of these tumors. This approach offers a wide access to the thoracic outlet with satisfactory control of subclavian vessels, safe dissection of brachial plexus and upper part of the mediastinum, permitting a radical treatment. However, this approach is associated invariably with aesthetic deformity, severe impairment in shoulder mobility (due to medial half clavicle sacrifice) and respiratory failure in case of chest wall resection. The authors present their experience with an alternative approach, the trans-manubrial osteomuscular sparing approach to anteriorly situated apical chest tumors recently standardized by Grunenwald and Spaggiari. From June 1996 to June 1997 5 patients were operated on through this approach: 3 non-small-cell lung cancer, 1 pseudotumor, 1 desmoid tumor of the first rib. In 2 cases the resection was extended respectively to the vertebral body (D1-2-3 hemivertebrectomy) and to the subclavian vessels. This patient died on 10-postoperative day for massive pulmonary ernbolism, whereas no other complications were recorded. This technique compared to the approach popularized by Dartavelle presents the same oncological radicality, with a better surgical exposure and with the complete sparing of osteomuscular components that allow the maintainance of shoulder girdle movements associated excellent functional and cosmetic results."
"We present a rare case of desmoplastic fibroma of the skull. Desmoplastic fibroma is a distinctive and rare neoplasm of bone that histologically and biologically mimics desmoid soft tissue tumor. Only 6 cases have been reported in the skull and none of these was diagnosed by MRI. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 64 year-old woman, operated on in June 1991 for left mastectomy due to a ductal adenocarcinoma and again in October 1994 for a left frontal metastatic adenocarcinoma, was admitted in our Department of Neurosurgery because a control cerebral MRI had detected a diploic lesion, isointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2, with moderate enhancement, localized in a right parietal site. Neurological examination was negative. The lesion was surgically removed and a cranioplasty was performed. Histological diagnosis was desmoplastic fibroma. Twelve months after treatment she has no neurological symptoms or signs of cerebral lesions (MRI) or systemic metastasis (total body CT). CONCLUSION: In the literature the number of desmoplastic fibroma is too small and the follow-up period too short to permit any conclusions regarding the aggressiveness of the tumor."
"Aggressive fibromatosis in the otolaryngological region is a curious clinical entity, demanding accurate histopathologic interpretation. It is rare connective tissue tumor, which growth infiltratively with a destructive biological behaviour similar to malignant tumours and a high recurrence rate. Morphologically reactive fibromatosis and fibrosarcoma should be considered amongst others in differential diagnosis. CT and MR scans are useful in determining the extent of the tumors and help to distinguish the tumor from nerves, vessels and bone. Surgery is the treatment of choice. Our observations of the course of disease in the maxillary sinus, nasal cavity and nasopharynx confirmed the date in literature."
Aggressive fibromatosis of the breast is an uncommon benign disease. The clinical and X-Ray findings can simulate breast cancer. The diagnosis relies on histology. The typical feature of this disease is a locally aggressive but non metastasizing lesion with high recurrence rate. Treatment consists in wide excision. The role of radiation and drug therapy including antiestrogens has not been clearly established. Colonoscopy is indicated to research for an association with Gardner syndrome.
"Desmoid tumour is a rare entity characterized by benign proliferation of fibroblasts. Although non malignant, this tumour can be life-threatening due to its invasive property and high recurrence rate. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We report a case of pelvic fibromatosis whereby the tumour was completely resected without sacrificing organs or major vessels. RESULTS: Thirty months after surgery the patient is asymptomatic, without any sign of recurrent disease. CONCLUSIONS: Radical surgery represents the main primary treatment for pelvic fibromatosis. The other available therapeutic options are discussed."
"To determine whether extraabdominal desmoid can be correctly diagnosed using both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and scintigraphy with pentavalent technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid and gallium-67 citrate, MRI (T1- and T2-weighted images) and scintigraphy were performed in 18 patients with 27 histologically proved extraabdominal desmoid tumors. The extraabdominal desmoid tumors were characterized by positive uptake of pentavalent technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid and lack of uptake of gallium-67 citrate on scintigraphy. These tumors were isointense to skeletal muscle on T1-weighted MRIs and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. They also displayed septum-like internal inhomogeneity and surrounding hypointense capsular band. The combination of scintigraphy and MRI is of value in correctly diagnosing extraabdominal desmoid tumors except in the rare case of fibrotic verylow-grade sarcoma."
Gardner's syndrome (GS) is complicated by abdominal desmoid tumors in approximately 8% of cases. We describe two cases of ureteral obstruction and fistulization due to rapidly enlarging desmoid tumors. Initial management consisted of placement of ureteral stents to provide urine drainage from the kidney as well as from the collection in the cavities within the desmoid tumors.
"A case of huge desmoid tumor successfully treated by hyperthermoradiotherapy is described. A 23-year-old man with familial adenomatous polyposis was operated upon for a desmoid tumor in the mesenterium involving the right kidney and small intestine in 1988. In 1990, the tumor recurred and could not be resected because of the involvement of the vena cava. The tumor grew larger and larger, and occupied two-thirds of the right lower quadrant. Several therapies using sulindac, tamoxifen, prednisolone, indomethacin, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue, and ascorbate were all ineffective. Finally, the combination of radiation and hyperthermia was used over a 6-month period. At the end of the hyperthermoradiotherapy, the tumor in the abdominal wall was markedly reduced in size, and the protruded abdominal wall became flat. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of the successful treatment of a huge desmoid tumor by hyperthermoradiotherapy."
"A 21-year-old woman was diagnosed with Turcot's syndrome (TS) at age 16 years. She had two ependymomas, one was located in the left middle cerebellar peduncle and the other in the low sacral spinal canal. Her mother and brother both had colectomies for colonic polyposis. Her maternal uncle and grandfather also had this disease and both died from cancer of the colon in their fourth decade of life. The patient was found to have hyperpigmented spots in the retina, skull osteomas and normal neurological examinations. The bone scan and CSF were normal and she had a germline mutation in the segment 3 of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Following partial resection of the two ependymomas, she was treated with radiation and chemotherapy. One year after surgery, paraspinal desmoid tumors were found and removed. She is presently 42 months postsurgical resection of the neural tumors and has remained central nervous system tumor-free. The occurrence of multiple ependymoma in TS has not been reported, and the control of this patient's ependymomas is consistent with other reports of long-term survival with TS and glial tumors."

"A nonrandom occurrence of trisomy 8 and of trisomy 20 in desmoid tumors has been recently reported. The finding of trisomy 8 in nondividing desmoid tumor cells by in situ hybridization prompted us to evaluate, in a similar way, the occurrence of trisomy 20 and the possible occurrence of both trisomies together because their co-existence was cytogenetically observed in a few cases. Double fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with centromeric probes for chromosomes 8 and 20 was performed on 16 single cell suspensions of desmoid tumors. FISH confirmed the occurrence of trisomy 8 or 20 in a single cell suspension of desmoid tumors. Both individual trisomies, and even more their association in the same cells, are rare to extremely rare in solid tumors in general and in mesenchymal tumors in particular, and are only known to occur in infantile fibrosarcoma."
"Titanium plate has been widely used in several surgical fields, such as craniofacial reconstruction and orthopedic prosthesis. This prosthesis has been proved not only with good biocompatibility and mechanical strength, but also with light weight and low radiological interference. From October 1991 to May 1995, 6 patients underwent thoracic cage reconstruction with titanium plate in our hospital. They included 5 females and 1 male, with ages ranging from 26 to 62 years. Four of them suffered from primary chest wall tumors (2 desmoid tumors, a chondrosarcoma, and 1 hemangioma), one had a recurrent chest wall tumor from breast carcinoma, and one had thoracic hypoplasia. The thoracic cage defect ranged from 5 x 6 cm to 10 x 15 cm, and 1 to 3 titanium plates were used for the reconstruction. No paradoxical movement or other prosthesis-related complications have occurred during the follow-up period. We conclude that titanium plate is a good material for thoracic cage reconstruction."
"To demonstrate the role of surgical trauma in desmoid tumor formation in Gardner's syndrome. METHODS: Literature review indicates that desmoid tumors are exceedingly common in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) where the comparative risk is 852 times that of the general population. Prior abdominal surgery has been found in as many as 68% of FAP patients with abdominal desmoids. Fifty-five percent develop these lesions within 5 yr of their surgery. We describe a patient with Gardner's syndrome complicated by a desmoid tumor. RESULTS: This patient underwent a prophylactic colectomy at age 14, and 3 yr later developed intra-abdominal desmoid tumors unresponsive to radiation therapy, surgical excision, Sulindac, and tamoxifen therapy. The desmoids became massive and were inoperable. However, they showed an apparent complete response to a chemotherapeutic regimen of doxorubicin (90 mg/m2) and dacarbazine (900 mg/m2) in divided doses over 4 days of continuous infusion every 28 days. Because CT scans could not confirm this complete response, laparoscopy was performed. However, within a matter of only several months, desmoid tumors began developing in each of the three trocar sites, became massive and inoperable, and led to the death of this patient. CONCLUSION: These findings provide convincing evidence of the association between surgical trauma and the occurrence of desmoid tumors in patients with Gardner's syndrome."
"Desmoid tumors are slowly growing fibrous tumors highly resistant to therapy and often fatal. Here, we report hereditary desmoid disease (HDD), a novel autosomal dominant trait with 100% penetrance affecting a three-generation kindred. Desmoid tumors are usually a complication of familial adenomatous polyposis, a predisposition to the early development of premalignant adenomatous polyps in the colorectum due to chain-terminating mutations of the APC gene. In general, one or more members in approximately 10% of the FAP families manifest desmoid tumors. Affected individuals from the HDD kindred are characterized by multifocal fibromatosis of the paraspinal muscles, breast, occiput, arms, lower ribs, abdominal wall, and mesentery. Osteomas, epidermal cysts, and other congenital features were also observed. We show that HDD segregates with an unusual germ-line chain-terminating mutation at the 3' end of the APC gene (codon 1924) with somatic loss of the wild-type allele leading to tumor development."

"Clinical desmoid disease affect approximately 10 per cent of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP); the subclinical rate is unknown. Desmoids are probably neoplastic rather than regenerative in origin and may arise in association with germline or somatic mutations at or beyond codon 1444 of the APC gene. Intra-abdominal desmoids behave unpredictably but are an important cause of death in those with FAP. Signal intensity on magnetic resonance imaging reflects tumour cellularity, which in part determines progression, and this may help management. Surgical treatment of advanced desmoids is hazardous, but medical treatments have limited success. Chemotherapy with doxorubicin and dacarbazine is currently under evaluation."
Polyfibromatosis syndrome is a condition characterized by the occurrence of several cutaneous fibrotic conditions including Dupuytren's contracture and keloid formation. A 10 year follow-up of a patient with an aggressive type of polyfibromatosis associated with erosive arthropathy is presented. The underlying pathogenesis and management of this uncommon condition is discussed.
"plasmocytoma, chondroma, fibrous dysplasia, eosinophilic granuloma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's tumor, epithelioid sarcoma, fibrosarcoma, hemangioma, benign neurilemmoma, desmoid tumor and liposarcoma. Two patients with chondrosarcoma were operated on for recurrences and there was also recurrence in the patient with Ewing's tumor. We conclude that: 1) chest wall tumors are infrequent, 2) radical exeresis is the treatment of choice and prosthesis is often necessary, and 3) chondrosarcoma, with poor outcome in our patients, is the most frequent tumor."

"An 8-month-old infant presented with 2 ulcerated indurated plaques in the right lower limb. The lesions grew rapidly initially but for the last 2 months, they have been stationary. Biopsy showed proliferation of fusiform fibroblasts some of which were arranged in whorls. The clinical picture and the histopathology suggested the diagnosis of an aggressive infantile fibromatosis. This is one of the types of juvenile fibromatoses, a group of tumours characterised by fibrous tissue proliferation present at birth or acquired early in childhood."
"We report a case of paratesticular desmoplastic small cell tumor. In accord with the literature, the patient was subjected to treatment with combined chemotherapy, but he developed progression of disease and died 13 months later."
"To evaluate local control rates in patients treated with radiotherapy for aggressive fibromatosis. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-three patients with histologically confirmed aggressive fibromatosis were treated with radiotherapy at the University of Florida between march 1975 and June 1992. The minimum length of follow-up was 2 years; 81% of the patients had follow-up for at least 5 years. The lesions arose in an extremity or limb girdle (39 patients), the trunk (10 patients), or the head and neck area (4 patients). Twenty-four patients were treated for gross disease and 29 for presumed microscopic residual disease after one or more operations. Patients were treated with total doses between 35 and 70 Gy; 83% of patients received 50 to 60 Gy. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 23 of 29 patients (79%) treated postoperatively for microscopic residual disease and in 21 of 24 patients (88%) treated for gross disease; gross disease was controlled in all 8 patients with previously untreated lesions and in 13 of 16 patients treated postoperatively for gross residual or recurrent disease. Overall, aggressive fibromatosis was locally controlled in 83% of treated patients. All nine treatment failures occurred in patients with extremity lesions 4 to 68 months after initiation of treatment. Three recurrences were in the irradiated field, two were out of the field, and four were at the field margin. Eight patients were salvaged with surgery alone or combined with postoperative radiotherapy. A functional limb was maintained in 38 of 39 patients with extremity or limb girdle lesions. Pathologic fracture occurred in three patients; two patients required rod fixation for treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy is a valuable adjunct to surgery in the management of aggressive fibromatosis and can be used alone in patients with unresectable or inoperable disease."
"This pilot project analyzed the tumor suppressor genes p53 and Rb in 13 cases of aggressive fibromatoses and six cases of palmar fibromatoses (Dupuytren contracture). Immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, polymerase chain reaction followed by single-strand confirmation polymorphism analysis, and Southern blot to detect gene rearrangements were used. No abnormalities were detected in p53. The aggressive fibromatoses demonstrated a lack of Rb immunohistochemical staining and decreased mRNA for Rb. No structural mutation in the coding sequence of the Rb gene was detected. The decreased level of Rb gene expression, despite a normal coding sequence, may indicate increased proliferation and may suggest potential treatment schemes."
"Desmoid fibromatosis is a locally aggressive proliferative soft tissue lesion of controversial nature. The authors investigated the clonality of this process by molecular genetic analysis of DNA methylation pattern at a polymorphic site at the human androgen-receptor gene (HUMARA) to examine the inactivation pattern of the X chromosome. Twenty desmoid fibromatoses including primary and recurrent lesions from 11 female patients were studied. Sixteen lesions from eight patients showed nonrandom X inactivation, consistent with a clonal origin and, therefore, a true neoplastic nature. Furthermore, multiple recurrent lesions from two patients exhibited the same inactivation pattern as the corresponding primary lesions, suggesting that they were derived from the same cell clone as the primary lesion. One patient was homozygous at the HUMARA locus, and two patients had the same skewed pattern in their normal and lesional tissues. The authors also found that digestion with HpaII, but not HhaI, failed to generate a nonrandom X inactivation pattern in some of the cases, suggesting that the methylation status at the HpaII sites was altered in some lesions, and that HhaI should be used to verify results and to avoid incorrect conclusions."
"Desmoplastic fibroma (DF) is an extremely rare bone tumor. The recommendations for therapy are often based on limited personal experience, and the rate of local recurrence in the published cases is very high. Therefore, an analysis of treatment results of published cases was performed. Furthermore, DNA analysis of the tumors from two patients was also performed. METHODS: The clinical, radiologic, and histologic data of two patients with DF of the long bones are presented. DNA flow cytometry was performed on both DFs, three cases of abdominal fibromatosis, and three cases of extraabdominal fibromatosis. One hundred eighty-nine patients analyzed in the literature and our own 2 patients were evaluated with regard to epidemiologic, clinical, and histologic data, with particular emphasis on treatment results. RESULTS: DNA analysis of the locally infiltrating tumors revealed indices of proliferation between 21.5% and 24%, noticeably elevated values in comparison with extraosseous desmoid tumors (8.04%). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was most valuable for imaging the intraosseous and extraosseous extent of DF. The evaluation of 191 patients (189 from the literature, 2 of the authors) showed the numbers of males and females to be equivalent, with a mean age of 23 years. DF has been reported in almost all bones, with a tendency to occur in the mandible and the long bones. Approximately 12% of patients presented with a pathologic fracture (20 of 161 patients). Infiltrative growth in the soft tissue was documented in 48% of patients. Three patients developed metastases after local recurrence. Analyzing the treatment results, the authors found a recurrence rate of 55-72% after nonresection procedures, and 17% after resection. No recurrences are reported after resection with wide surgical margins. The recurrence rate of tumors of the extremities was 55%, and 25% of these patients eventually required an amputation. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the ""semimalignant"" character of this entity and the poor treatment results in patients with recurrent tumors, marginal or wide resection for primary treatment is recommended. The superior imaging quality of MRI greatly facilitates preoperative planning."
"Although cutaneous desmoplastic malignant melanoma (DMM) has been well characterized, those arising from the oral mucosa have been less well defined. METHODS: We evaluated the clinical and pathologic features of three patients with biopsy-proven DMM examined at the North Carolina Baptist Hospital. Routine hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides were reviewed in all three cases. Sections from all cases were examined immunohistochemically using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase (ABC) technique and employing commercially available antibodies to the following antigens: S-100 protein, HMB-45, NK1C3, and cytokeratin (AE1/AE3). Appropriate positive and negative controls were utilized throughout these procedures. Clinical data were obtained from the patients' medical records. RESULTS: Age at diagnosis for the three male patients were 42, 64, and 75 years. Anatomically, these neoplasms arose from the left maxillary oral mucosa (two patients) and the vermilion border of the lower lip (one patient). Initial incisional biopsies of all three patients were misinterpreted as desmoid tumor (one patient) and squamous cell carcinoma (two patients), respectively. Histologically, all tumors were poorly circumscribed and composed of fascicles and bundles of spindle-shaped cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and associated with extensive stromal collagenization. Perineural invasion was noted in two tumors. An overlying atypical, intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation was observed in two tumors. Immunohistochemically, all three tumors showed positive immunoreactivity with S-100 protein and vimentin. One tumor also expressed HMB-45. Wide surgical incision was the primary mode of therapy in all patients. One patient also received multiple courses of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. One patient died of widespread metastatic disease. CONCLUSIONS: DMM of the oral mucosa is a rare, often unrecognized, form of malignant melanoma associated with a fibrosarcoma-like morphologic appearance and abundant collagenization. Meticulous attention to histomorphology and judicious use of immunohistochemical stains will help prevent misdiagnosis."
"Desmoid tumors of abdomen were described based on the literature. The unusual case of 28 years old pregnant women with tumor infiltrated symphysis was analyzed. The diagnostic procedures, surgical technique using the artificial material as well as the delivery was shown."

"Desmoid tumors are uncommon benign neoplasms of fibroblastic origin, frequently presenting in the abdomen or abdominal wall of adults. This tumor is well known to general surgeons and pathologists, but it has rarely been reported in the neurosurgical literature. We describe a neonate who presented with a right temporal subscalp tumor at birth. In spite of initial apparent total removal, the tumor recurred twice. We discuss the diagnostic pitfalls encountered in assessing this tumor and the difficulties in distinguishing, in the excised specimens, between desmoid and reactive fibrosis. We suggest that desmoid tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis of scalp and calvarial masses in children. Complete excision is required to prevent recurrences, and sometimes a multidisciplinary team is needed to secure margin-free resection."
"The purpose of this article is to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of surgical procedures designed to eliminate the risk of colorectal cancer, the surgical treatment of extracolonic polyps, and the management of desmoid tumors."
"Tamoxifen and toremifene have been used in patients with advanced desmoid tumours with response rates of 51%. METHODS: We developed an experimental model of desmoid tumour cells in tissue culture to study their effect. Four cell lines were established in tissue culture. All native and corresponding cultured tumours were oestrogen receptor negative. Tumour 1 was from a 22 year old with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and recurrent abdominal wall desmoid tumours. She remains disease free on tamoxifen 4 years following surgery. Both her mother and sister also have shown regression of their FAP-associated desmoid tumours at the menopause and on tamoxifen, respectively. We assessed the effect of tamoxifen on desmoid tumours in tissue culture at 780 ng/mL. The results were assessed by cell density counting. RESULTS: Tumours 1 and 2 have responded with an approximately. 50% reduction in growth to tamoxifen at 780 ng/mL. CONCLUSIONS: This apparent growth inhibitory effect of tamoxifen on two desmoid tumour cell lines appears to be independent of oestrogen and correlates with the in vivo effect of tamoxifen on three desmoid tumours in an FAP family."
"Desmoid tumors may rarely develop at the site of an unrelated surgical procedure. This is an index description of a desmoid tumor occurring at the line of a pancreatic resection. Because sporadic intra-abdominal desmoids are markedly less prone to recurrence than genetically determined desmoids, it is reasonable to suggest re-resection for the infrequent recurrence in sporadic cases. BACKGROUND: Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors are infrequently encountered in surgical practice and, when seen, are most often those genetically determined tumors associated with Gardner's Syndrome or familial polyposis. In contrast, fewer than 100 cases of sporadic intra-abdominal desmoid tumors have been reported; only 16 of these sporadic tumors have occurred at the site of a previous surgical procedure. The current report describes a case of sporadic desmoid tumor that developed at the pancreatic suture line 18 mo following distal pancreatectomy for a nonsecreting islet cell tumor. METHODS: An extensive literature search was focused on desmoid tumors in general, and sporadic intra-abdominal desmoids in particular. RESULTS: During the course of this collective review, it was noted that the high rate of postoperative recurrence for intra-abdominal desmoids in genetically determined cases differed markedly from the low rate of recurrence after section of sporadic tumors."

"To determine the efficacy of chemotherapy for inoperable desmoid tumours associated with familial adenomatous polyposis. DESIGN: A review of three cases of unresectable desmoid tumours and of the literature on the subject. SETTING: The Steven Atanas Stavro Polyposis Registry at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto. PATIENTS: Three patients with symptomatic, unresectable desmoid tumours associated with familial adenomatous polyposis and unresponsive to conventional hormone therapy. INTERVENTION: A chemotherapy regimen of seven cycles of doxorubicin (dose ranging from 60 to 90 mg/m2) and dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2), followed by carboplatin (400 mg/m2) and dacarbazine. OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical improvement and tumour regression demonstrated by computed tomography. RESULTS: In each of the three cases significant tumour regression was seen clinically and radiologically. CONCLUSIONS: Cytotoxic chemotherapy is an effective treatment for desmoid tumours associated with familial adenomatous polyposis. The chemotherapy should be started early in cases of symptomatic desmoid tumour unresponsive to conventional medical therapy."
"Desmoid fibromatosis is a rare tumor of the head and neck. Only five cases involving the sino-orbital region have been previously reported in the literature. In this report we describe the sixth such case, involving a 2-year-old boy, and review the literature."

"Aggressive fibromatosis (AF) is a benign, non-metastatic proliferation of fibroblasts in the musculoaponeurotic compartment that tend to infiltrate locally and recur after surgical resection. Wide local excision with adequate clear margins is the treatment of choice. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are excellent in delineating the extent and depth of these lesions. Thus they play an important role in the surgical management of these patients. There are a few descriptions of the MRI characteristics of these lesions in children. Radiographically, our cases are typical of others described in the literature-hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images."
"A 54-year-old man was evaluated for symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction. Evaluation revealed a 10 by 9.8-cm tumor composed of bland, fibroblastic, poorly cellular material adjacent to the prostate. Administration of a course of antiestrogen (tamoxifen) and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (sulindac) resulted in prompt relief of symptoms and a slow decrease in the size of the tumor as measured by computed tomography. After 54 months of therapy, the tumor was undetectable clinically and dramatically reduced in size as seen on computed tomography. Data on the natural history of desmoid tumors and the efficacy of various therapeutic strategies are reviewed."
"Elastofibroma, or elastofibroma dorsi as it was first described, is an uncommon tumor-like process that characteristically appears as an ill-defined mass in the infrascapular region of elderly patients. This lesion can occur bilaterally and may appear asynchronously. The occurrence of elastofibroma in other anatomic sites has been reported, although with much less frequency. Elastofibromas display typical diagnostic histologic, cytologic, and electron microscopic features. The use of magnetic resonance imaging can lead to a presumptive diagnosis in elderly individuals with suprascapular lesions. It is important to differentiate this lesion from other soft-tissue lesions, such as sarcomas and desmoid tumors. This study presents a case of bilateral elastofibromas in a 72-year-old man and a review of the literature."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a well described locally destructive benign lesion, comprising 0.3% of all solid tumors. Although the chest wall is a common location, this tumour has rarely been associated with breast tissue or breast implants. Herein is only the fourth case described in conjunction with a breast implant and the only case linked to a ruptured silicone implant. This tumour was locally aggressive and required wide surgical resection, including removal of the chest wall, to gain control. Wide surgical resection is recommended with the application of adjuvant radiation therapy being more controversial."
"The desmoid tumor is benign, uncommon, and frequently recurs after excision. It can be confusing in terms of diagnosis and treatment due to its ability to achieve large size, causing functional limitation and/or pain. Its overall clinical characteristics can mimic those of its malignant counterparts. Because of its high rate of recurrence, surgical treatment should include a wide excision around the margins."
?
"The optimal management of inoperable desmoid tumors is still unclear. We report a 26 year-old female patient with familial adenomatous polyposis suffering from a recurrent inoperable intraabdominal desmoid tumor and its sequential treatment. METHODS: Treatment strategies included low-dose tamoxifen (30 mg orally per day), high-dose tamoxifen (90 mg orally per day), and a subsequent combination of goserelin acetate (3.6 mg subcutaneously once every four weeks) plus low-dose tamoxifen, medroxyprogesterone acetate (1000 mg orally per day) and interferon gamma (3 Mio IU subcutaneously 3 times a week). RESULTS: The combination of goserelin acetate and low-dose tamoxifen resulted in a decrease in tumour size and a complete relief of symptoms for 17 months. Thereafter the tumor progressed and again growth was stopped with interferon gamma therapy for another 6 months. All other treatment modalities had no effect. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates long-term regression of a desmoid tumor with combined endocrine therapy using goserelin acetate plus tamoxifen. Tumor progression after 17 months was again stopped by a combination of interferon-gamma and goserelin acetate."
"Chest radiography, CT, and MR imaging were performed in a 3-year-old girl who had posterior mediastinal fibromatosis with transforaminal intraspinal and chest wall extension. Chest radiographs and CT scans showed a slow-growing, noncalcified but locally aggressive left paravertebral mass. The mass was slightly hyperintense relative to muscle on both T1-weighted and fast spin-echo T2-weighted MR images."
"We have seen two patients with Crohn's disease and mesenteric fibromatosis, the least common form of desmoid tumor. Although both gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal tumors are relatively common in Crohn's disease, this type of tumor has not been seen in > 1,650 patients operated on for this condition. As the only common factor in the two male patients discussed in this article was previous intestinal resections, surgical trauma may be a predisposing factor in the occurrence of these desmoid tumors. We will continue to search for other examples in patients with Crohn's disease."
"Desmoid tumours in Gardener's syndrome are a rare cause of ureteric obstruction. We report two cases of ureteric obstruction caused by desmoids, in a mother and daughter."
"Activating mutations of the alpha chain of the heterotrimeric signal transducer Gs disrupt the inherent guanosine triphosphatase activity of the alpha chain, stimulate adenylyl cyclase, and can result in independent cell proliferation. Such mutations are identified in a number of endocrine disorders, including McCune-Albright syndrome, which is a triad of endocrinopathy, cafe au lait spots, and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. The mutation in this syndrome is a missense point mutation in exon 8 that results in the substitution of either histidine or cysteine for arginine at position 201. Monostotic fibrous dysplasia is a nonhereditary isolated bone lesion. Other isolated bone lesions that share some cytologic and clinical similarities to fibrous dysplasia are osteofibrous dysplasia and aggressive fibromatosis involving bone. Four cases of monostotic fibrous dysplasia, four cases of aggressive fibromatosis involving bone, and one case of osteofibrous dysplasia were studied to determine if a mutation was present in exon 8 of the alpha chain of Gs. A missense mutation was present in all of the fibrous dysplasias. The other fibrous lesions and uninvolved tissue did not contain a mutation. Somatic activating mutations of Gs differentiate fibrous dysplasia from the other lesions and may be responsible for the loss of control of local proliferation and growth factor expression."
"Infantile fibrosarcoma and its pathological variants are unusual childhood tumors. During the past 25 years, 18 children with these lesions were seen at our institution. METHODS: These patients' records were analyzed to determine clinical and pathological findings and outcome. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 7 months. There were 16 boys and 2 girls. The sites of tumor at presentation were: Extremity, head, trunk, and pelvis. Pathological findings were: fibrosarcoma, myofibroma, and fibromatosis. Histologic characteristics varied from benign hypocellular to more cellular pleomorphism. The initial surgical procedure was a complete excision in 16. Of those patients with complete removal, 6 recurred and all had secondary reexcision. In addition to excision, 3 patients received adjunctive therapy; chemotherapy in all 3 and radiation in 2. Sixteen (89%) children survived, including 4 of 6 with recurrent tumor and 2 of 2 with incomplete initial resection. Two children ages 6 and 9 months at diagnosis died of progressive recurrent tumor at 1 month and 6 years from initial diagnosis, despite operative therapy, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Both had paraspinal tumors that were removed completely. Pathological examination revealed spindle cell tumors infiltrating muscle. Neither clinical nor histologic findings distinguished surviving from nonsurviving patients. CONCLUSIONS: Fibrosarcoma occurring in infants has an excellent outcome despite histologic findings. Initial complete excision should be attempted in all children. Recurrence indicates a more aggressive variant and warrants more aggressive complete reexcision wherever possible. Adjunctive therapy probably has no benefit. The occasional death indicates the need for close follow-up."
"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a dominantly inherited disorder characterized by the presence of more than 100 adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum starting in the second decade of life. FAP is associated with extra colonic manifestations, including desmoid tumors. METHODS: A 2-year-old girl presented with a rapidly enlarging tumor of the forehead and a family history of FAP. The tumor was cultured for cytogenetic studies. A DNA linkage study using flanking and intragenic polymorphisms of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene was performed to identify the allele loss in the tumor. Germline mutation identification was by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis of exon 15 of the APC gene, with subsequent double stranded sequencing of fragments with conformational changes. A mutation-induced loss of a restriction site was used to confirm allele loss in the tumor. RESULTS: Microscopically, the tumor had desmoid features. Cytogenetic analysis of the tumor demonstrated loss of chromosome region 5(q21q22). A truncating adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutation was identified in the leukocyte DNA from the child and her affected father. Linked DNA markers suggested that the tumor had lost the maternal, wild-type allele. A mutation-induced restriction endonuclease site alteration demonstrated hemizygosity of the mutant sequence in the tumor DNA. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are compatible with the presence of a ""second hit"" inactivation of the APC gene and implicate this gene in the pathogenesis of desmoid tumors."
"Our goal was to describe the MR appearance of distal femoral cortical irregularity (DFCI). METHOD: With plain radiographs and MR images of 100 knees, the presence of DFCIs was determined, and the shapes of DFCIs were classified into three subgroups: concave, convex, and divergent cortical shapes. Radiographic and MR shapes of DFCIs were compared. RESULTS: DFCIs were shown in various shapes on both the radiographs and the MR images. Forty-four DFCIs were found both on radiograph and by MR image. An additional 14 DFCIs were identifiable only on MR images. However, the majority of DFCIs showed an association between radiographic and MR shapes. MRI revealed that all 58 DFCIs were located at the attachment site of the medial gastrocnemius muscle. DFCIs were enhanced in three of the four patients who underwent postcontrast MR study. CONCLUSION: A good understanding of radiographic and MR findings of the DFCI may be of great help in the differential diagnosis of distal femoral lesions."

"An extraabdominal desmoid tumor of the shoulder occurring in a middle-aged woman without Gardner's syndrome is described. Two punch biopsy specimens from the tumor were initially interpreted as representing scar tissue; a third incisional biopsy specimen demonstrated the characteristic features of a desmoid tumor. Because desmoid tumors are locally aggressive, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to minimize morbidity and mortality. Typical clinical and histologic findings characteristic of an extraabdominal desmoid tumor are described, and treatment options are reviewed."
"Despite its benign microscopic appearance and nonmetastatic behavior, aggressive fibromatosis infiltrates neighboring tissues and has a considerably high recurrence rate (30%-60%). It is a rare lesion (0.03%-0.1% of all tumors) with an incidence of between two and four cases per million residents and per year. There is no agreement regarding the etiology of fibromatosis. Hormonal, traumatic and genetic influences have been described. It is a common manifestation in Gardener syndrome. The treatment of choice is broad surgical resection. When resection is incomplete or impossible, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or chemotherapy in combination with hyperthermia is the second choice of treatment. On the basis of five children observed, we discuss the etiologic factors, classification, clinical aspects and results of surgical and medical therapy."
"The case of an 18-year-old girl is described who 1 year after surgical stabilisation of a spine injury developed a multifocal desmoid tumor in the scar region and another at a distance away from the scar in the area of the left scapula. After nononcological resection of both tumors subsequent diagnosis with magnetic resonance imagins (MRI) showed a questionable recurrence only in the scar; positron emission tomography failed to elucidate the local situation. Because a radical re-resection would mean mutilation, and local radiation may damage the spinal cord, a 'wait-and-see' strategy was chosen for further follow-up."
"15 in the mesentery, 10 in the abdominal wall and 4 in other sites. There were 12 male and 17 female patients with a mean age of 28.2 years (range 7 months to 59 years). The cumulative life-time risk was 21%; 1.5, 3.0, 8.9, 16 and 18% at ages of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 years, respectively. The risk of postcolectomy desmoids was 17% after ileorectal anastomosis and 12% after proctocolectomy. There were no deaths due to desmoids. One abdominal scar desmoid disappeared spontaneously and all the other abdominal wall desmoids could be excised without complications, but recurrence occurred in five (45%) cases. Excision was possible in only nine mesenteric desmoids (56%); in these cases recurrence was less common (two cases, 22%) but two others had life-threatening complications (bleeding, short bowel). We conclude that the desmoid problem concerns more than 20% of all FAP patients in long-term. Despite high recurrence rates and surgical hazards surgery remains a useful option for most desmoid tumours in FAP patients considering that other treatments are often ineffective or hazardous as well."
"Conventional cytogenetics of breast and other solid tumors has been hampered by a number of factors. An analysis of breast tumor tissues was therefore undertaken using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). A total of 34 specimens were analyzed using a chromosome 8-specific alpha-satellite probe. Various approaches were tested and compared. Among 30 informative samples, 11 infiltrating ductal carcinomas, not otherwise specified (NOS), 5 ductal carcinomas in situ, 5 lobular carcinomas, 3 papillary carcinomas, and 6 benign lesions were studied. Of the 11 cases of infiltrating ductal carcinomas (NOS) analyzed, four cases showed 3 signals, one case showed 4 signals, and the rest showed 2 signals. Of the 5 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ samples, 1 showed 3 signals and the other 4 cases showed 2 signals. All cases of lobular carcinomas, papillary carcinomas, and benign lesions showed 2 signals. We inferred from these data that 36% of the infiltrating ductal carcinomas (NOS) were trisomic and 9% were tetrasomic, whereas 20% of the ductal carcinomas in situ were trisomic. All samples from lobular carcinomas, papillary carcinomas, and the benign lesions were disomic. From our preliminary data, it can further be concluded that a subset of breast cancer is characterized by chromosome 8 trisomy. These data are consistent with an ever-increasing database on the association of chromosomal 8 trisomy with other cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, prostate cancer, ovarian carcinoma, salivary gland tumor, malignant melanoma, desmoid tumors, and recently gestational trophoblastic disease. It is also noted that the ability to analyze formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival material will enable a more comprehensive cytogenetic study of breast cancer than is currently available."
We present a rare localisation of desmoid tumor in retroperitoneal space. Although it is very unusual to perform radical operation in similar settings in this patient we were able to resect whole tumor with a spleen and pancreas tail which makes the case particularly interesting.

"Aggressive fibromatoses (desmoid tumors) are rare tumors of fibroblastic origin that may arise in any musculoaponeurotic structure with a propensity of infiltrate adjacent tissues, but not to metastasize. Tumors of musculoaponeurotic origin are seldom encountered by the gynecologist. A case of pelvic fibromatosis is reported together with a discussion of theories of etiology and management options."

"Fibrous tumor of childhood include several disorders with variable biologic behavior. In the review by Coffin and Dehner [1] of 190 soft-tissue neoplasms in 183 children, 27% were fibroblastic or myofibroblastic in origin. Although nearly all fibrous lesions are benign, they may be locally aggressive. The purpose of this essay is to describe clinical characteristics and to illustrate radiologic features of commonly encountered fibrous lesions of childhood. Familiarity with the presentation and variable appearance may aid the radiologist in suggesting the diagnosis of fibromatosis."
"Three methods of chest wall reconstruction using autogenous rib grafts were reported. Fresh non-vascularized autogenous rib graft, vascularized autogenous ribs with muscle-flap, and pasteurized autogenous rib grafts were the materials used in these techniques. They are less convenient than those with artificial materials but afterwards physiologically more natural chest wall will be reconstructed. The third method (pasteurized rib graft) was applied to 22-year-old female with large recurrent desmoid tumor. Six resected ribs were heated in the saline at 60 degrees C for 30 min. and three of them were returned to the former position. Though tumor cells and bacteria are killed under this condition, these heated bone can be revascularized and replaced by normal bone as early as fresh non-vascularized rib graft."
"In humans, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment has been associated with characteristic changes in circulating white blood cell populations (leukopenia followed by leukocytosis) and increased cell-surface expression of integrins. A similar pattern of effects on leukocytes occurs with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and G-CSF treatment. To determine whether these effects were caused directly by TNF or as a result of secondary CSF release, G-GM-, and M-CSF levels were measured after TNF infusion (9.6 x 10(6) U/mg protein; < 5.0 endotoxin U/mg protein) in cancer patients during two phase I trials of TNF. One patient with aggressive fibromatosis was treated with TNF alone (200 micrograms/m2, days 1-5 every third week) and 10 patients (four colon cancer, four head and neck cancer; one melanoma; one sarcoma) received mitomycin C (15 mg/m2, day 1) followed by TNF (60-180 micrograms/m2, days 1-3) every sixth week. All treatments were given IV, mitomycin C over 5 minutes and TNF over 2 hours. Serum samples were collected at times 0 (before mitomycin C and TNF) and 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours after TNF initiation on day 1 and at similar times on subsequent treatment days. M-CSF samples were analyzed by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and G-CSF and GM-CSF by ELISA. The mean baseline M-CSF levels in normal control subjects (n = 12) was 158.4 +/- 36.2 (SD) U/mL, and in pretreatment cancer patients (n = 10) 235.7 +/- 60.9 U/mL (p = 0.004, Wilcoxon test). M-CSF levels increased 4 hours after TNF initiation (mean 354.7 +/- 96.3 U/mL; p = 0.020), remained elevated at 6 hours (305.6 +/- 45.4 U/mL; p = 0.004, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), and subsequently declined. This pattern was seen in all patients treated with TNF, whether treatment was TNF alone or TNF with mitomycin C. In patients treated with mitomycin C and TNF, G-CSF levels increased at 4 hours after TNF initiation (mean 3886 +/- 2009 pg/mL; p = 0.004), remained elevated at 6 hours (mean 2140 +/- 1131 pg/mL; p = 0.004), and subsequently declined. GM-CSF levels were not measurable before or after treatment with TNF. The changes in all three endogenous cytokines were not temporally related to the previously described leukopenia and integrin upregulation on circulating leukocytes and, therefore, appear to be unrelated to this event. However, release of endogenous G-CSF and M-CSF under the influence of TNF does temporally coincide with the previously described leukocytosis, suggesting a possible role for these endogenous cytokines in the release of bone marrow cellular stores."
"Familial adenomatous polyposis coli is caused by constitutional mutations in the APC gene. The hallmark of familial adenomatous polyposis coli is the presence of numerous (> 100) colorectal polyps, but mutations in the 5' end of the APC gene have been associated with familial colorectal cancer without florid polyposis. Although familial adenomatous polyposis coli accounts for only a minority of familial colorectal cancer cases, we hypothesised that APC mutations which were not associated with florid polyposis might make a significant contribution to nonpolyposis familial colorectal cancer. To investigate this possibility, we analysed 40 unrelated patients with familial colorectal cancer without classical familial adenomatous polyposis coli for mutations in exons 1 to 6 (codons 1 to 243) of the APC gene. No mutations were detected, but a C-->T polymorphism at nucleotide 333 (Arg-->Trp at codon 99) was identified. No 5' APC mutations were detected in two patients with desmoid tumours and a family history of colorectal cancer and polyps. We conclude that mutations in exons 1 to 6 of the APC gene are infrequent in patients with familial colorectal cancer who do not have many colorectal polyps."

"Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF) is a rare hereditary disorder named by Drescher et al. in 1969. As recently as 1985, only 30 cases had been reported worldwide. We report the case of a 9-year-old girl who was diagnosed with JHF at age 3 and has been closely followed since. She initially had slowly growing multiple soft tumors over her entire body as well as hypertrophic gingiva and mild bone deformities. She was originally misdiagnosed with infantile myofibromatosis at age 3. However, at age 6, because of the light and electron microscopic findings of the tumors, she was diagnosed as having JHF. Currently, at age 9, she has nodular lesions developing over her body as well as bone changes that are progressing with no evidence of regression."
"Desmoplastic fibroma is a rare, locally aggressive, benign tumor that is considered the skeletal counterpart of the desmoid tumor of soft tissues. Although the treatment of choice of desmoplastic fibroma is surgical excision, radiation therapy should be considered when surgery is not a viable option."
"in 2 cases as the sole aberration, in 1 together with +X, -Y and -13 and in 1 with +8 and a supernumerary marker chromosome. Our findings indicate that gain of chromosome 20 is an early event in the development of a large subset of desmoid tumors and that it is as frequent as +8, the only consistent chromosomal change previously reported in this tumor type. The non-random occurrence of trisomies 8 and 20 in desmoid tumors indicates shared pathogenetic mechanisms with infantile fibrosarcoma, a fibrous tissue tumor characterized by various combinations of trisomies for chromosomes 8, 11, 17 and 20."
"A series of 15 digital lesions in 8 pediatric patients is presented. All infantile digital fibromas appear early in life at the distal or proximal interphalangeal joint level, characteristically involve the ulnar three digits, may be multicentric, and undergo rapid growth within a short time. Histology reveals deep dermal origin and intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies not observed in any other fibrous proliferative disorders. A viral etiology has never been proved. The lesions may recur despite wide excision followed by resurfacing with a flap or graft. This distinctive lesion has no adult counterpart and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hard, immobile distal digital masses in children."

"We present a case of desmoid tumor associated with prior alloplastic breast reconstruction. Wide local excision that includes chest wall resection, if necessary, is the primary treatment of choice. Patients with extensive nonresectable or recurrent disease may benefit from radiation therapy. Systemic therapy is a possibility in certain cases, but its toxicity generally precludes its use with this nonmetastatic tumor. Although this is the fourth reported case of desmoid tumor arising after implantation of a silicone prosthesis, we cannot claim a causal relationship. Careful follow-up consisting of yearly physical and mammagraphic examinations may facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of locally aggressive desmoid tumors but is not warranted, except in the context of routine screening for breast carcinoma."
"We describe the CT findings in two pediatric cases of intrathoracic desmoid tumor arising from the chest wall. In both cases, CT showed heterogeneously enhanced intrathoracic masses with destruction of the ribs."
"This study was conducted to evaluate clinical prognostic factors predictive of the probability of recurrence of desmoid tumor (DT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-three patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of DT were retrospectively studied. Median age at diagnosis was 13 years. Patient distribution by site was as follows: 61% extremities, 18% head and neck, 13% trunk (including 5% intraabdominal), and 8% multicentric lesions. All patients had partial or complete resections; 20 patients also received radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. RESULTS: At a median follow-up time of 6 years since first treatment, the overall actuarial probability of having one or more recurrences was 75%. Age, sex, site, size, or number of previous recurrences had no significant impact on the likelihood of recurrence. The only factor associated with an increased proportion of recurrence-free patients was a negative margin of resection (70% v 15% with positive margins; P = .006). Of the four patients with more than 3 years follow-up since chemotherapy, two recurred, and of the 11 patients with the same follow-up after radiotherapy, four recurred, including two of five patients who received a dose of 50 Gy or more. No deaths directly related to tumor invasion were observed. CONCLUSION: A surgical approach aiming at clear margins is presently the best treatment option. When this cannot be accomplished without severe disfigurement or function impairment, partial resection is an acceptable alternative, but one associated with a high risk of regrowth. Whether adjuvant strategies should be used in this situation remains to be addressed."

"The proliferations of the connective tissue, which are summed up under the term fibromatoses, assume a special position with regard to their biologic behavior. While superficial fibromatoses are more likely to grow slowly, musculoaponeurotic fibromatoses (Desmoid tumor)--like malignant tumors--show a locally bound aggressive, rapid growth behavior. A metastazation, however, can never be proved. The research on etiology of fibromatoses has yielded only little knowledge. Besides genetic and hormonal factors, physical reasons are under discussion, too. The present study aims to add another description of a case report to the small number of case presentations on radiotherapy-associated fibromatosis. In 1977, a now 67-old-patient was irradiated because of a Morbus Hodgkin lymphoma in the left side of his neck. Prior to the radiation, the patient had undergone several surgeries. 17 years after the radiation, the patient developed an aggressive fibromatosis (prelaryngeal, right) in the formerly irradiated region. As the localization of the fibromatosis does not allow us to establish a connection to his numerous operations preceding the fibromatosis, a radiation-associated Desmoid tumor must be assumed. Immunohistologically, no estrogen receptors were detectable."
"A 62-year-old male patient presented with a complaint of the lower abdominal distention. Ultrasonography demonstrated bilateral hydronephroses and a huge heterogeneous mass in the pelvic cavity. Excretory urogram showed left-non visualized kidney and right-hydronephrosis. CT showed a heterogenous mass, situating 25 cm in diameter, adjacent to the left side of the bladder. Tumor resection was carried out on May 17th of 1994. Histopathological diagnosis of the surgical specimen was abdominal desmoid with HE stain."
"The life-threatening event of early colorectal cancer in FAP patients may effectively be prevented by prophylactic colectomy. Desmoid tumors and periampullary carcinoma are now becoming the most frequent causes of death in FAP patients. Since the establishment of the Heidelberg polyposis registry in January 1991 we evaluated the frequency of desmoid tumors in 171 prospectively reexamined FAP patients. 29 patients (17%) with desmoid tumors were identified. In our series R0-resection with a wide security margin was performed in 12 cases, 3 of which developed a desmoid recurrence, 8 are free of desmoids and one treated for an intraabdominal desmoid states being well but refuses a radiological reevaluation. Tumor debulking was performed in 6 patients and led to an aggressive desmoid progression in 4 patients despite additional postoperative administration of tamoxifen and sulindac. Nonsurgical treatment with tamoxifen and sulindac seemed beneficial in 5 of 7 patients, 4 showed a stagnation of tumor growth, a reduction of an abdominal wall desmoid was documented in one female with a further intraabdominal desmoid. In life-threatening cases chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be considered. In two females radiation therapy resulted in a remarkable tumor reduction. The operative trauma of previous colectomy is considered the most relevant predisposing external factor inducing desmoid growth in FAP patients. 50% (11/22) of the desmoid tumors in our series were diagnosed within the first two years postoperatively, and 72% (18/22) of the desmoids developed within the first four years after colectomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"The authors describe a 31-year-old man with a 7 cm aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumor) of the spermatic cord presenting as a swelling in the left inguinal area that was excised along with the testis and cord. The desmoid tumor is histologically typical, but such tumors arising primarily from the paratesticular structures have apparently not been previously reported and the diagnosis would not be questioned if it not for the unusual site. This tumor is histologically and immunohistochemically indistinguishable from abdominal wall desmoid tumor, with or without Gardner's syndrome. Desmoid tumors at this location should be distinguished from reactive processes, such as pseudosarcomatous myofibroblastic proliferation (so-called ""proliferative funiculitis"") and inflammatory fibrous pseudotumor, all of which exhibit fibroblastic/myofibroblastic differentiation. Paratesticular fibrosarcoma and leiomyosarcoma should also be differentiated from desmoid tumor that does not have the metastatic potential of sarcomas. Thirty-four months post-operatively, an 8 cm local recurrence in the remaining portion of the left vas deferens causing left hydroureter and hydronephrosis was detected."
"In the submitted review of the literature the authors evaluate contemporary therapeutic possibilities of mesenterial desmoids. A more detailed pattern of cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic chemotherapy, actinotherapy and hormonal therapy is presented. Surgical resection is limited by the size of the tumour and above all by early detection before the size of 15 cm is reached. In larger tumours conservative treatment by a combination of non-cytotoxic and hormonal treatment is better. Actinotherapy of the intraabdominal region is not suitable. The percentage of relapses is high, a standard therapeutic procedure has not been elaborated so far. Despite rather surprising remissions of desmoids in individual cases the general results of different groups are not encouraging. In a case-history the authors describe their experience with the treatment of a young female patient with a mesenterial desmoid which, however, was not successful."
"Plantar fibromatosis can be quite disabling to the patient, as well as a technical challenge to the surgeon. Patients who undergo previous local excisions and in whom aggressive recurrences develop are difficult to manage successfully. We present a consecutive series of five primary procedures on patients with painful plantar fibroma and seven revision operations on patients with recurrent plantar fibroma. The average follow-up was 47 months (range, 22-66 months) in the primary group and 40 months (range, 21-78 months) in the revision group. The overall results were satisfactory in four of the five primary operations, with only one recurrence. In the revision group, five of seven results were satisfactory with no recurrences. The major complication that led to unsatisfactory results was the development of a postoperative neuroma. In this article, we outline our present surgical techniques of wide primary excision and a staged revision procedure with delayed split-thickness skin graft closure. These techniques can be used successfully to manage this disabling, progressive disease."
To demonstrate different biologic features of desmoid tumors on MRI between juvenile and adult patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have retrospectively analyzed clinical records and 121 MRI findings in 40 patients (8 juveniles and 32 adults) with proven desmoid tumors. The Fisher exact test and Kaplan-Meier curve were utilized for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Recurrences in the juvenile patients were more multiple (50 vs 12%) and appeared significantly earlier than in the adult patients. Adult patients demonstrate a much greater recurrence-free rate (p = 0.0001). Infiltrative pattern was significantly predominant in the juvenile patients (63%) whereas the nodular pattern was more frequent in the adult patients (81%). Low-signal intensity zones on T1- and T2-weighted imaging as well as the type of contrast enhancement did not show any significant relationship with biological behavior. Four cases with no significant contrast enhancement showed low signal intensities on T2-weighted imaging. CONCLUSION: Magnetic resonance demonstrates different biologic features between juvenile and adult patients with histologically same desmoid tumors. These differences may be useful in consideration of MRI follow-up studies.

"The Authors report a case of thoracic desmoid tumor. The strict correlation between a previous chest injury and the site of desmoid tumor in this patient seems to strengthen the possible etiological role of trauma, as already suggested."
"To determine the spectrum of diseases that can involve the rectus abdominis muscle and sheath (RMS) and to describe the clinical features of these conditions. METHOD: A retrospective medical record review of RMS disorders seen at The New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center from 1971 to 1992. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients with diseases of the RMS were identified. Thirty patients had primary diseases of the RMS, most commonly desmoid tumor and hematoma. Secondary disorders of the RMS included abscesses from diverticulitis, a perforated sigmoid carcinoma, gallbladder empyema, and disseminated actinomycosis. Eleven of 18 patients with desmoid tumors had familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). The desmoid tumors in patients with FAP resulted in greater morbidity and mortality than those in patients without FAP. All patients with hematomas were on anticoagulation or had a history of trauma, vigorous coughing, or physical exertion. CONCLUSIONS: 1) RMS disease should be suspected in patients with a palpable abdominal mass and a history of familial adenomatous polyposis, trauma, anticoagulation, or vigorous coughing or exercise. 2) The most common non-neoplastic condition of the RMS is a hematoma. 3) The desmoid tumor is the most common neoplasm of the RMS. 4) Abdominal ultrasonography and CT readily distinguish RMS disease from intraabdominal pathology."
"(a) myxoid, vascular, and inflammatory areas resembling nodular fasciitis; (b) compact spindle cells with intermingled inflammatory cells (lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils) resembling fibrous histiocytoma; and (c) dense plate-like collagen resembling a desmoid or scar. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated positivity for vimentin, muscle-specific actin, smooth muscle actin, and cytokeratin consistent with myofibroblasts. Based on this series, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor is a benign, nonmetastasizing proliferation of myofibroblasts with a potential for recurrence and persistent local growth, similar in some respects to the fibromatoses."
"Desmoid tumours are rare benign lesions with an important local invasive potential and high risk of recurrence. The reported incidence is low, and the diagnosis is made in young women with an abdominal mass. Estrogen levels, a history of trauma and Gardner's syndrome have been incriminated. The defect of the entire thickness of the abdominal wall was reconstructed with a graft of marlex in three cases. The aggressive behavior of these three cases, and diagnosis of eight extraperitoneal cases in a short period of two years prompted us to review the features of the disease."
Management of the primary lesion in patients with soft tissue sarcomas is combined modality in the majority of instances. The modalities are surgery and irradiation. Radical surgery as currently practiced in major oncology centers does not achieve local control in an important proportion of patients.
"Fibromatosis is the nonmalignant proliferation of fibroblasts that aggressively invade adjacent tissues. The cause of this abundant growth is unknown. When fibromatosis develops in the mandible or adjoining tissues, its aggressive growth can compress the trachea and cause death. Resection is the treatment of choice. Mandibular reconstruction is performed to prevent displacement of the remaining mandibular segment or segments and consequent difficulties in eating and speaking. Perioperative nurses who care for children with oral or paraoral fibromatoses must understand the special physical and psychological needs of these patients to effectively plan their care."

"This 9-year-old girl presented with a painful mass in the posterolateral aspect of her right knee. Excisional biopsy of the mass revealed a juxta-articular myxoma. The differential diagnosis for such an intra- or periarticular mass should include meniscal cyst, parameniscal cyst, ganglion cyst, juxta-articular myxoma, focal nodular PVNS, and desmoid tumor. Current imaging techniques do not allow differentiation between these benign lesions and low grade myxoid-containing sarcoma."

"An 8-yr-old Japanese boy developed infantile digital fibromatosis in the right ring finger with recurrence and another lesion in the right middle finger. Histologic investigation of the tumor disclosed that the size and frequency of inclusion bodies were inversely proportional to the degree of fibrosis. Electron microscopic study revealed a variety of stages in the development of inclusion bodies, ranging from small, dense aggregates of filaments into bundles with dense bodies traversing the cytoplasm to typical inclusion bodies that also contained cytoplasmic organelles. In areas of dense fibrosis, the cytoplasm of the tumor cells showed areas of constriction and compression by adjacent bundles of collagen. The tendency for a decrease in the number of inclusion bodies in these areas necessitated a differential diagnosis from other fibrous or fibro-histiocytic lesions. Our findings suggest that the tumor may undergo a decrease in the numbers of inclusion bodies and spontaneously may become fibrotic with time. Thus, even as a form of fibromatosis featuring both recurrence and multiple lesions, it may not have a consistently aggressive nature. These findings support the concept that infantile digital fibromatosis should be managed by limited excision rather than by immediate aggressive surgical treatment."
"Infantile (desmoid-type) fibromatosis is an uncommon, locally aggressive tumor that is seldom reported in the dermatologic literature. We describe a case of infantile (desmoid-type) fibromatosis in a 2-year-old girl. Surgical disposition entailed amputation of the affected digit. Our report is intended to heighten awareness of this potentially fatal tumor, and emphasize the importance of timely diagnosis and treatment."
"In transgenic mice harboring the bovine papillomavirus genome, fibrosarcomas arise along an experimentally accessible pathway in which normal dermal fibroblasts progress through two pre-neoplastic stages, mild and aggressive fibromatosis, followed by a final transition to the tumor stage. We found that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) displays only modest transcriptional regulatory activity in cells derived from the three non-tumor stages, whereas it is highly active in fibrosarcoma cells. Upon inoculation into mice, the aggressive fibromatosis cells progress to tumor cells that have high GR activity; thus, the increased transcriptional regulatory activity of GR correlates with the cellular transition to the tumor stage. The intracellular levels of GR, as well as its hormone-dependent nuclear translocation and specific DNA binding activities, are unaltered throughout the progression. Strikingly, the low GR activity observed in the pre-neoplastic stages cannot be overcome by exogenous GR introduced by co-transfection. Moreover, comparisons of primary embryo fibroblasts and their transformed derivatives revealed a similar pattern--modest GR activity, unresponsive to overexpressed GR protein, in the normal cells was strongly increased in the transformed cells. Likewise, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) displayed similar differential activity in the fibrosarcoma pathway. Thus, the oncogenic transformation of fibroblasts, and likely other cell types, is accompanied by a striking increase in the activities of transcriptional regulators such as GR and RAR. We suggest that normal primary cells have a heretofore unrecognized capability to limit the magnitude of induction of gene expression."
"A case of familial adenomatosis coli with villous adenoma of the third portion of the duodenum, which falls in the category of a Gardner's syndrome, is described. The patient, who had complained of an abdominal mass which had been diagnosed as a desmoid tumor after surgical resection, had numerous adenomatous polyps throughout the colon confirmed by colonoscopy with biopsy. Endoscopic examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract revealed fundic gland polyposis in the stomach and numerous small adenomas in the duodenum. In addition, there was a pedunculated polyp in the third portion of his duodenum, measuring 30 mm in diameter, the surface of which had a cauliflowerlike appearance. The polyp was removed with the electrocautery snare and was histologically diagnosed as villous adenoma. Our case report supports the concept that villous adenoma, which possesses a high malignant potential, may occur in the upper gastrointestinal tract in patients with familial adenomatosis coli, and careful examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract including the distal duodenum seems to be necessary in the follow-up patients with this disease."
"To describe abscess formation complications in desmoid tumors of patients with Gardner's syndrome and percutaneous drainage. METHODS: Three patients with Gardner's syndrome and intramesenteric desmoid tumors were diagnosed as having intratumor abscess formation. Percutaneous drainage was the initial method of treatment in each case. Two subsequently underwent surgical resection and one patient refused surgery and was lost to follow-up. RESULTS: In each case, percutaneous drainage and antibiotics resulted in clinical improvement. In two, fistulous communication with the small bowel could be demonstrated, presumed to be the cause of abscess formation. Surgical resection confirmed fistula communication to the small bowel. In the third patient, no fistula was seen and only percutaneous drainage was performed. CONCLUSION: Abdominal pain and fever in patients with Gardner's syndrome and desmoids is suggestive of abscess formation in these tumors. Percutaneous drainage is useful as initial management."

"Aggressive fibromatosis is a rare soft tissue tumour with a high tendency to local recurrence, even after apparently adequate resection. Wide local excision with a margin of at least 3 cm, depending on the anatomical location, should be performed to improve rates of recurrent disease. There is no consensus concerning the role of radiotherapy in the treatment of these lesions. The clinical findings of 39 cases diagnosed between 1972 and 1991 were reviewed retrospectively. Local control was effected in 19 of 32 patients treated with surgery alone after a median (range) follow-up of 72 (18-236) months. There were 40 cases of recurrent fibromatosis in 15 patients. Local control was obtained in 13 of 14 patients who received radiotherapy using a wide-field technique and doses of more than 50 Gy over a period of 5 weeks after marginal or incomplete resection of primary or recurrent lesions (P < 0.001). The results suggest that in a selected group of patients with aggressive fibromatosis radiotherapy may effectively achieve control of residual disease after surgery without marked disfigurement and loss of function."
"A 47-year-old man had aggressive fibromatosis, and CT and MR showed a large, multilobulated soft-tissue mass within the prevertebral and retropharyngeal spaces. On CT, the lesion was slightly higher in attenuation than adjacent muscle; on MR, it was intermediate between muscle and fat on unenhanced T1-weighted images, isointense with fat on intermediate-weighted images, hyperintense relative to fat on T2-weighted images, and markedly enhanced after administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine. Multiple small focal and linear areas of decreased signal intensity that did not enhance with gadopentetate dimeglumine were observed on all pulse sequences."
"An earlier study has shown that FAP patients with mutations in codons 136-302 of the APC gene do not develop congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE), whereas those with mutations in codons 463-1387 regularly do. Here we present data on 36 patients from 20 families with mutations in codons 1445-1578. These patients lack CHRPE. Furthermore, with the exception of three prepubertal children all patients with mutations in codons 1445-1578 developed desmoid tumours. This relationship between certain extracolonic manifestations and site of the APC mutation points to a specific role of the APC protein in different tissues."

"The desmoid tumour with infiltrative and destructive growth tendencies, is a rare benign alteration of the connective tissue from musculo-aponeurotic structures and fascial sheaths. The exact pathogenesis is unknown, however trauma (surgery), genetic (Gardener's Syndrome) or hormonal factors (pregnancy) have been implicated. A spontaneous malignant transformation of a desmoid (extra-abdominal fibromatosis) to a fibrosarcoma is a rarity. Only one case is recorded in the literature. We report on the second case in international literature and describe the coherence to an endocrine factor (pregnancy), the high recurrence rate and the difficulty of therapy with regard to the risk of late malignant transformation."
"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a dominantly inherited genetic disorder predisposing to colon cancer through the early development of multiple adenomatous polyps in the large bowel. FAP is not restricted to the colon and rectum, but is a more complex disease which can potentially affect almost any organ not only with benign tumours but also with life threatening carcinomas. Desmoid tumours and gastroduodenal polyps and cancer are the two more worrying extracolonic manifestations of FAP. Recent advances in FAP knowledge, such as the report of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE) or the APC gene identification, are very useful for screening and long-term follow-up of the patients through regional or national registries. Nutritional and pharmacological intervention trials are under way to assess potential new medical treatments of FAP. Surgery is still the only effective treatment for colorectal cancer prevention in FAP. The choice of a surgical procedure is controversial, but the introduction of total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis can be considered as a major advance in surgical treatment of FAP during the last decade."

"Cytogenetic analyses of short-term cultures revealed clonal chromosome aberrations in 6 of 13 desmoid tumors. These aberrations included two consistent events, trisomy 8 (n = 4) and trisomy 20 (n = 3), which have not been reported previously in desmoid tumors. Because trisomy 8 was found in two recurrent desmoid tumors, we used fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) methodology to evaluate chromosome 8 in 25 paraffin-embedded and frozen desmoid specimens. The FISH studies demonstrated that both patients with cytogenetic trisomy 8 at the time of recurrence also had had trisomy 8 in primary tumors 4 years earlier. The proportion of trisomy 8 cells in these cases did not change substantially between original diagnosis and recurrence. The FISH studies also revealed trisomy 8 in one recurrent desmoid tumor which had been cytogenetically unremarkable and revealed trisomy 8 in one recurrent desmoid that had not been karyotyped. Four of six patients with trisomy 8 had been followed for more than 1 year, and the desmoid tumors in each of these 4 patients recurred. By contrast, recurrence was noted in only 2 of 17 patients whose desmoid tumors lacked trisomy 8. Our findings demonstrate that trisomy 8 and trisomy 20 are nonrandom aberrations in desmoid tumors. Trisomy 8 appears to be associated with an increased risk of recurrence."
"This report illustrates the unique problems of reconstructing thoracoabdominal wall defects coexisting with diaphragmatic defects. STUDY DESIGN: Two patients with extensive primary chest wall tumors (chondrosarcoma and desmoid tumor) underwent aggressive resection of the hemithorax, hemidiaphragm, and anterior chest wall for cure. The combined chest and abdominal wall defect was greater than 625 cm2 in both cases. RESULTS: Functional restoration of these massive thoracoabdominal defects was accomplished by use of polypropylene-methyl methacrylate prostheses and vascularized tissue coverage. The requirements for rigidity, protection, and esthetic contouring of the chest wall are satisfied by this reconstruction. This technique also offers the flexibility and durability that the abdominal wall requires. Repair of the diaphragm using this technique is secure and simple. CONCLUSIONS: Our report confirms the principle that, with modern thoracic and plastic operative techniques, the extent of tumor resection should not be compromised because of concern over the ability to reconstruct the defect."

"Desmoid tumor, characterized by aggressive growth and frequent recurrence without metastasis after excision, remains to be a poorly understood neoplasm. In seventeen patients with desmoid tumor of the extremities, the relationship between the cytobiological activity and prognosis of desmoid tumor was studied by reviewing clinical material, histologic examination, statistical analysis of Ag-NORs, and morphometry of tumor cell nuclei in comparison with those of fibrosarcoma and soft tissue fibroma. The results showed that the cells of desmoid tumor were highly proliferative with their biological activity bearing resemblance to fibrosarcoma. Thus we have good grounds for grouping desmoid tumors as of low grade malignancy. We believe that initial surgical resection with a wide margin is the key for good prognosis because a lower recurrence rate will result."
"The authors review the literature, discuss clinical aspects and options in the management of desmoid tumors, analyze recent advances in the understanding of its biology and how they affect therapeutic choices, and outline future treatment perspectives. We conclude that although recurrence rates are high, wide excision is the best firs approach. If it is not possible, marginal surgery and radiation therapy can be performed. Radiation therapy can be also use in the attempt to control recurrent disease. Although many pharmacologic agents have been advocated there is no clear proof of their usefulness. Systemic therapy may be considered for selected patients that are not amenable to local treatment."

"29 wide excisions on 22 patients, 52 intra-lesional excisions with wide margins on 16 patients, and 17 incomplete excisions on 3 patients. One patient, with intra-pelvic lesions, died of a massive haemorrhage 3 days after surgery. Forty patients were followed from between 3 and 29 years. One, who had a multicentric EADT for 21 years, died from the disease. The significant factors concerning local recurrence after wide procedures were an unsatisfactory initial wide local excision, disease affecting 4 or more muscles and the invasive nature of the recurrences. We recommend wide local excision of these tumours in all anatomical areas that allow this procedure. When major nerves and vessels are involved, we recommend an intralesional excision with wide margins in order to preserve limb function. Radiation therapy should be confined to cases in which wide local procedures are not feasible. Overall, 37 of our patients (90%) were cured of the disease, 2 had their disease controlled, and 2 died."
"To our knowledge, progressive coxa valga, femoral anteversion, and hip subluxation after surgical resection of soft tissue tumors of the gluteal muscles have not been described. The importance of this paper is to document proximal femoral deformity and hip subluxation in children after tumor resection of the hip abductor muscles, to provide guidelines for diagnosis and management of this problem, and to avoid late complications of progressive joint incongruity. Late deformity was seen in two cases after limb salvage surgery for a soft tissue buttock tumor. In both cases, the gluteus medius and minimus muscles were completely resected and the tensor fascia lata and gluteus maximus were partially resected. The ages of the patients at initial treatment were 4 months old and 5 years old, and both patients were followed for a minimum of 4 years. Valgus deformity was seen as early as 15 months. One patient has had a varus osteotomy to correct severe coxa valga and hip subluxation; the other patient with moderate deformity is being followed clinically and radiographically."

"Despite the great variability in the clinical behavior of fibrous lesions of the musculoskeletal system, they are composed of cytologically similar fibrocytes. Receptors for estrogen or progesterone, or both, are present in some of these lesions and some increase their rate of growth during periods of high levels of sex steroid hormones. The platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) proto-oncogene encodes the B chain of PDGF, a mitogen for fibrocytes. Tissue from aggressive fibromatosis, fibrous dysplasia, plantar fibromatosis, and recurrent plantar fibromatosis was analyzed with use of the polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization for the expression of PDGF-B and PDGF beta receptor. Cell culture was used to determine if estrogen and progesterone stimulation modulated the expression of PDGF-B. Aggressive fibromatosis, fibrous dysplasia, and recurrent plantar fibromatosis expressed PDGF-B; plantar fibromatosis, normal plantar fascia, normal fascia lata, and mature scar did not. All of the tissues expressed PDGF beta receptor. The level of expression in aggressive fibromatosis and fibrous dysplasia was four times that in the recurrent plantar fibromatosis. Estrogen and progesterone stimulation in aggressive fibromatosis resulted in an increase in the level of expression. Therefore, the detection of PDGF-B may be an adjunct in the pathologic identification of locally invasive lesions. Its production may be a common mechanism leading to a fibroproliferative response through deregulation of the control of growth by both paracrine and autocrine mechanisms."
"The records of 40 consecutive patients treated at the Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) between 1979 and 1988 for aggressive fibromatosis were reviewed. The median follow-up was 86 months (range 21-167 months). All surgery was performed at the referring hospitals. Thirty-six underwent an attempt at excision, four were biopsied. Thirty-one had no overt disease after surgery and 26 of these received adjuvant irradiation. Eight were treated with radiotherapy alone, and another was treated with azathioprine and prednisone. Twenty-four (60%) presented with recurrent disease. The overall relapse free rate was 63% at 5 and 10 years. Combined surgery and irradiation had a higher relapse rate than irradiation alone (46% vs. 25%), and a high proportion of failures in the combined group were marginal failures (36%). Relapses following surgery alone were 1/5 (20%), and chemotherapy 0/1. Tumour size greater than 8 cm predicted for relapse (p = 0.002), but tumour site, status of surgical margins, and presence or absence of a history of relapse were not statistically significant. Twelve with subsequent treatment failure underwent successful salvage surgery, and 37/40 (92%) were disease free at last follow-up. A functional assessment (modified Johnstone scale) revealed 11/24 patients (46%) with poor functional outcomes (grade 2 or less) after all treatment compared with 6/24 (25%) at referral. Ten of 11 (91%) with grade of 2 or less had a history of recurrence, and 4/5 amputations were for treatment of a painful recurrence. Treatment planning in this study was hampered by inadequate information on tumour location since few patients had clinically apparent disease when seen by the radiation oncologist (only 35% of cases) and fewer had preoperative cross-sectional imaging available (12% of cases).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"During an antenatal echography, we observed a here to unreported fetal tumour which was diagnosed after birth as aggressive fibromatosis. The infant was treated with chemotherapy and, at the age of 27 months, still had a sclerous mass on the trunk which cause major scoliosis. Fibromatosis is a locally malignant fibrous tumour. During the unpredictable clinical course, recurrence after treatment as well as spontaneous regression is observed. Therapeutic management decisions (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) must be made on a case by case basis. Hormone factors and inappropriate oncogene expression are pathogenic factor."
"Idiopathic carpotarsal osteolysis is 1 of the rare types of disappearing bone diseases characterized by painful limitation of movement and deformity of the wrist and tarsal joints, and associated with frequent episodes of joint inflammation and a radiographic appearance of osteolysis. Reported here is an 8-year-old girl with idiopathic carpotarsal osteolysis and Bartter's syndrome with significantly decreased re-absorption of chloride at distal renal tubules, low level of serum potassium, a metabolic alkalosis, and high levels of aldosterone and renin. Bartter's syndrome associated with idiopathic carpotarsal osteolysis has not been published previously. The typical plantar nodule in this patient confirmed the presence of fibromatosis with aggressive histologic signs in light and electron microscopic examination."
"The results of Sehydrin (Hydrazine Sulfate, HS) treatment of 740 patients with the advanced, recurrent or metastatic solid tumours of various localizations or malignant lymphomas, for whom all the methods of specific treatment (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy) had been exhausted are presented in this work. The objective response, symptomatic therapeutic effects and toxicity were estimated. Clinically significant objective responses were registered in patients with the soft tissue sarcomas, including neuroblastomas, and paradoxically--in such semimalignant tumours as desmoids. Although the objective response in patients with the lung cancer (90%--non-small cell) was only 4%, stabilization of long duration was registered in 22% of cases connected with the impressive relief of heavy common symptoms in 38.5% of the treated patients. Such a subjective response was established in 46.6% of all the 740 cases. The drug given per os was well tolerated by patients in primary and subsequent courses and did not induce myelosuppression or other significant side effects. On the basis of observations available, Sehydrin may be assessed as an alternative drug for the treatment and symptomatic therapy of patients with some advanced solid tumours and malignant lymphomas at a disease stage when the other methods of treatment can not be used. A possible mechanism of antitumour and symptomatic action is being discussed."
"To define the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging characteristics of plantar fibromatosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients (19 feet) with proved plantar fibromatosis underwent preoperative MR imaging at 1.5 T. A control group of 19 people (24 feet) also underwent MR imaging. RESULTS: Twenty-seven lesions (mean size, 2.2 x 1.0 cm) were identified. All had infiltrative upper margins. Four (15%) of the 27 grew deep to the aponeurosis; 25 (92%) exhibited some signal intensity heterogeneity. All 27 of the lesions on T1-weighted conventional spin-echo (SE) images, seven (78%) of the nine on T2-weighted conventional SE images, and 17 (94%) of the 18 on T2-weighted fast SE images were isointense to minimally hyperintense (to the signal intensity of adjacent muscle). Five (83%) of the six lesions on short inversion time inversion-recovery images were hyperintense. Enhancement was variable on contrast material-enhanced images; nine (60%) of the 15 lesions on these images showed marked enhancement. CONCLUSION: Plantar fibromatosis is a benign but infiltrative neoplasm with a characteristic location and appearance on MR images."
"Desmoid tumors are associated with as many as 20% of cases of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Gardner's syndrome. In the present study, four specimens from different regions of a massive intraabdominal desmoid tumor from a 23-year-old white male with Gardner's syndrome were analyzed cytogenetically. Two different clonal abnormalities were observed. Two of the four specimens analyzed showed a del(5)(q14q31), which involves the region q21-->22 where the familial adenomatous polyposis gene is localized. In the two other specimens, a balanced translocation involving chromosomes 3 and 4 and an inv(4) was detected. Our findings confirm previous reports about the importance of chromosome defects on 5q in development of desmoid tumors, particularly in patients with Gardner's syndrome."
"Desmoid tumors are uncommon fibroblastic proliferative lesions usually occurring in the abdominal wall of adults. We report an unusual case of such a tumor presenting as a rapidly growing cervical paraspinous mass in a 19-month-old girl. After surgical resection without adjuvant therapy, the child is recurrence free after 17 months. The primary treatment of these lesions is surgical resection. We found magnetic resonance imaging to be the best imaging method for evaluation, because it was able to distinguish the tumor from the surrounding muscle. Careful postoperative surveillance is warranted, because these tumors have a high rate of recurrence. Although rare, desmoid tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a paraspinous soft tissue tumor in a pediatric patient."
"The phenotypic expression in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is variable. This study compares the phenotype of 27 patients with an identical 5 base pair (bp) deletion at codon 1309 with a group of 61 matched patients with FAP where knowledge of specific mutations is not available and with seven other different mutations in 24 subjects. Patients with the codon 1309 deletion have significantly more colorectal polyps at the time of colectomy than age and sex matched FAP controls (p = 0.0001). The median number of polyps in colectomy specimens of patients with the deletion at codon 1309 was 4000 (interquartile (IQ) range 3000-4875), compared with 600 (IQ range 488-1400) in the matched controls. Mutations at codon 1323, 1407, and 233 were also associated with large numbers of polyps. Desmoid disease and extracolonic cancers were more common with the mutation at codon 1309 (p = 0.003). In conclusion, there may be a correlation between a specific germline mutation and the number of large bowel polyps. There is residual heterogeneity in phenotypic expression, however, and this may result from the influence of other genes, specific environmental factors or chance."
"In this study we investigated the diagnostic significance of a set of different morphometric nuclear parameters in the differential diagnosis of soft tissue tumors. Nuclear area, the standard deviation of the nuclear area, the shape factor and other parameters such as Feret's Diameter and Martin's Radii were assessed using a computer assisted image analyzer system. A statistically significant difference (p < 0.01) between benign and malignant tumors and tumor-like lesions could be confirmed for the nuclear area and the standard deviation of the nuclear area, with the significance level being lower (p = 0.5) for the latter parameter. The shape factor also discriminated between the examined groups. Reclassification of the assessed histological diagnosis was performed by linear discriminant analysis using all possible combinations of the different nuclear parameters. This procedure disclosed an increasing rate of correctly reclassified cases with rising number of parameters applied. We conclude that the assessment of nuclear parameters may be helpful in the correct diagnosis and differential diagnosis of soft tissue tumors and tumor-like lesions of fibrous origin."
"Superficial fibromatosis without capacity for infiltration and deep fibromatosis with variable capacity for infiltrative growth. One of the deep fibromatoses is aggressive fibromatosis which is a local infiltrating process never known to metastasize. Two cases of aggressive fibromatosis are presented and histological characteristics and prognosis are reviewed. Once the diagnosis aggressive fibromatosis is established, surgical removal of the lesion by large excision is the only sufficient treatment."
"An 11 year old girl presented with gradually increasing swelling over left scapular region and limitation of movements. On examination, a mass with firm to hard consistency was found fixed to the scapula. Clinical diagnosis of fibromatosis was confirmed by needle biopsy. Radical excision of the tumor was carried out and the resultant large exposed area was covered by transpositional rotation of trapezius myocutaneous flap. Microscopic examination of excised tumor revealed spindle shaped elongated cells in the form of whorls and trabeculae. The post operative course of the patient was uneventful with no evidence of recurrence at the end of 22 months."
"Intrathoracic desmoid tumors are extremely rare, only 12 cases having been reported in the literature. In the 14-year-old girl we describe, a desmoid tumor manifested as an intrathoracic mass. Computed tomography of the chest after administration of intravenous contrast medium showed a large intrathoracic heterogeneous mass and lysis of multiple adjacent vertebral bodies. After incomplete resection of the tumor, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed residual tumor that produced signal intensity equal to that of skeletal muscle. Intense enhancement after intravenous administration of gadolinium allowed improved delineation of adjacent tissue involvement."
"A case has been presented of a 14-year-old male patient who developed a fusiform mass on the volar aspect of his left forearm following two fractures. Microscopic features and plain radiography, CT, and MRI appearance of juxtacortical aggressive fibromatosis are discussed."

"1) fascicles of myofibroblasts, 2) disorganized mature adipocytes and 3) small rounded primitive mesenchymal cells. Immunohistochemically, the myofibroblastic component expressed muscle specific actin and vimentin, and the primitive component expressed vimentin only. There was no evidence of increased cellular proliferation in the primitive cell component using proliferating cell nuclear antigen antibodies. Of the 15 lesions 1 recurred locally and 14 were apparently cured by local excision. Awareness of this presentation of fibrous hamartoma of infancy may avert misdiagnosis of more aggressive lesions, especially infantile fibromatosis or rhabdomyosarcoma."
"Intra-abdominal desmoid tumours represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), and such patients are also liable to develop musculoskeletal desmoids. We have reviewed the CT appearances of 44 desmoid lesions (28 intra-abdominal and 16 musculoskeletal) in 20 patients with FAP. We found a considerable heterogeneity in the CT appearance of musculoskeletal and intraabdominal desmoids, with respect to their density, definition and change in size or density on follow-up, not only between different patients but also in patients with multiple lesions, who rarely showed identical appearances of all lesions. In some cases, mesenteric tumours may initially present as ill-defined soft tissue infiltration of mesenteric fat, becoming larger and more mass-like with time. On medical treatment, shrinkage was seen infrequently in musculoskeletal desmoids, and not at all with mesenteric lesions. CT evidence of bowel involvement by intra-abdominal lesions was frequent, most commonly appearing as 'tethering' or encasement of bowel loops. The presence of a large mesenteric mass (> 10 cm diam.), multiple mesenteric masses, extensive small bowel involvement and/or bilateral hydronephrosis were associated with ultimate death."

"Experience in the treatment of 25 patients with aggressive fibromatosis of the true pelvis is discussed. To establish a precise diagnosis obligatory and special methods of examination were applied. Secondary changes in the adjacent organs and structures were found in 24 patients. Radical operations were conducted on 19 (76%) patients, in 13 of them the interventions were combined. The mean duration of the operations was 5.3 hours. Complications developed in 17 out of 19 patients. Hemorrhage was the most frequent (in 12 out of 19 patients) and menacing complication. The blood loss was 3036.8 ml on the average. Recurrences were registered in 8 out of 19 (42.1%) patients."
"Sporadic desmoid tumors occur mainly in the abdominal wall and in extraabdominal sites. Desmoid tumors in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) usually occur in the abdominal wall and in the bowel mesentery. Surgical resection of desmoids in patients with FAP has been controversial. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients with FAP and desmoid tumors treated from 1950 to 1991 was performed. Patients were evaluated for gender, age, site of desmoid tumors, treatment, recurrence, and survival. RESULTS: Twenty-one of 24 patients underwent 60 surgical procedures related to the desmoid tumors. Seven of nine patients who underwent potentially curative surgery had recurrences; three were reresected. Major morbidity after palliative or curative surgery was 47%. Five patients were alive with no evidence of disease at a median of 198 months, 10 patients were alive with disease at a median of 102 months, and 5 patients died with disease at a median of 31 months after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Desmoid tumors are common in patients with FAP. Unresectability and recurrence are more common than cure. Palliative and curative resections have a high morbidity. Surgery should be reserved for those patients with symptomatic mesenteric desmoids."
"Fibromatosis (desmoid tumor) can sometimes develop at sites of previous surgery or previous trauma, but it is very rarely detected at sites of prior irradiation. We report two cases of fibromatosis following radiotherapy for Hodgkin's disease. The fibromatoses, developing in the radiation fields, were detected at the posterior area of the neck 11 years after irradiation in one case and in the peritoneal cavity 3 years after laparotomy and irradiation in the second case. The tumors did not differ clinically or histologically from those seen in patients who did not undergo irradiation. Although rare, fibromatosis should enter the differential diagnosis of masses developing in irradiated fields in patients with treated Hodgkin's disease."
"Extracolonic manifestations of Gardner's syndrome are common and may precede the detection of colonic polyps. Tc-MDP bone scintigraphy performed on a patient with Gardner's syndrome demonstrated intense uptake of radiotracer within the maxilla and mandible as a result of the dental anomalies associated with this disorder. Nuclear scintigraphy has a role in the imaging of these patients for skeletal anomalies, the detection of thyroid carcinoma, and for skeletal metastases when colon carcinoma is detected."
?
"The oncologic and functional results of treatment of aggressive fibromatosis were reviewed in 16 patients. Five had undergone previous resections. Complete surgical excision, the recommended primary treatment modality for aggressive fibromatosis tissue lesions, could only be performed in five patients. Radiation was administered in 13 patients and mainly used when the resection margins were positive. One patient required reoperation for recurrence. Complete detailed follow-up data were available in 15 patients. Functional analysis revealed 11 good-excellent, 2 fair, and 2 poor results using the Enneking classification. Local control was achieved with a combination of surgery and radiation, maintaining good-excellent function in most patients. The local nature of this tumor can be controlled with surgery and radiation while preserving function in the upper extremity."
"A radical forequarter amputation with partial chest wall resection (one to four ribs) has been reported for benign and malignant lesions involving the shoulder and chest wall region. Concerns about reconstruction and postoperative pulmonary function have previously limited more extensive chest wall resections. The current report describes the first case in which a complete unilateral anterior and posterior chest wall resection and pneumonectomy (hemithoracectomy) accompany a forequarter amputation. A novel reconstructive technique used the full circumference of the forearm tissue with an intact ulna as a free osseomyocutaneous flap. METHODS: In this case, a 21-year-old patient presented with an extensive recurrent desmoid tumor that involved the shoulder, brachial plexus, subclavian vein, and chest wall from the lateral sternal border to the midportion of the scapula and down to the eighth rib. The operative technique involved removal of the entire right hemithorax from the midline sternum to the transverse process posteriorly, down to the ninth rib inferiorly. Due to the absence of a rigid hemithorax, the uninvolved ipsilateral lung was also removed. The forearm flap was prepared before final separation of the specimen and division of the subclavian vessels. RESULTS: Postoperatively, the patient maintained excellent oxygenation without atelectasis or fever and was extubated on the 15th postoperative day. As expected after pneumonectomy, significant decreases from preoperative to immediate postoperative values were noted for the vital capacity (VC) (from 4.87 L to 1.29 L), forced 1-s expiratory volume (FEV1) (from 3.77 L to 1.02 L), and inspiratory capacity (IC) (3.33 l to 0.99 l). Rehabilitation included a specially designed external prosthesis to provide cosmesis and prevent scoliosis. By the 15th postoperative week the patient had returned to normal social and physical activities, with a gradual improvement in all respiratory parameters: VC 1.52 L, FEV1 1.29 L, IC 1.04 L. There has been no evidence of tumor recurrence at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: This report provides evidence that a complete hemithoracectomy, pneumonectomy, and forequarter amputation can be safely performed for selective tumors involving the shoulder region with extensive chest wall invasion. Reconstruction may be achieved with an extended forearm osseomyocutaneous free flap with an excellent functional outcome."
"Ten desmoid tumors were examined by chromosome banding analysis and by in situ hybridization on short-term cultures and frozen sections. Trisomy 8 was detected in four out of ten tumors, of which only one had shown trisomy 8 by karyotype analysis. Since trisomy 8 has been reported in superficial fibromatoses, which are clinically distinct but histologically similar to desmoid tumors, the occurrence of trisomy 8 in both may be a further indication of a close relationship."

"colon-rectum neoplasia (36.3%), bladder carcinoma (36.3%), prostate carcinoma (9.9%), ovary cancer (4.5%), abdominal wall desmoid tumor (4.5%), pheochromocytoma (4.5%) and gastric carcinoma (4.5%). Urinary diversions type has been: percutaneous nephrostomy (40.9%), ureteral stent (31.8%), both (13.6%) and cutaneous ureterostomy (13.6%). Urinary diversions were performed unilateral in 90.9%. The average survival has been 4.8 months. The quality of life was poor in 68.1%. The following complications were observed: urinary infection (45.4%), hematuria (36.3%), diversion catheter lose (34.8%) and obstruction (27.2%). Urinary diversion in pluri-treated cancer patients must be carefully indicated to prevent negative aspects upon psychophysic and social activity of the patients."
"Desmoplastic fibroma is a rare benign primary bone tumor, histologically identical to the extra-abdominal desmoid tumor of soft tissues. The incidence in major series of bone tumors is 0.1%-0.3%. In the present study 18 cases from the files of the Netherlands Committee on Bone Tumors are reported, with an emphasis on the radiographic features. Eight female and ten male subjects were affected, with a fairly even age distribution from the second to the seventh decade of life. The most frequent sites of involvement were the femur and the pelvis. Radiographically the lesions nearly always demonstrated benign features with respect to pattern of destruction, margins, and reactive bone formation; however, soft tissue extension was sometimes present. Although desmoplastic fibroma usually presents with pain or swelling, in 5 of the 18 cases the existence of the lesion was an accidental finding, and in 2 cases the patient had long-standing, vague complaints of pain. Though overall benign radiographic features may support the final diagnosis, the main and often troublesome histological differential diagnosis is of a low-grade fibrosoma. En bloc resection is the treatment of choice in view of the high incidence of recurrence after curettage."

"Desmoid tumors (DTs), the result of an abnormal proliferation of connective tissue, occur frequently in familial adenomatous polyposis. Treatment of DT is difficult because of the high rate of recurrence after operation. Recently, antiestrogens and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs have been used with good results as inhibitors of DT cell proliferation. METHODS: In this report we performed in vitro studies on cultured desmoid cells and skin fibroblasts of four patients who underwent surgical resection of DT and normal skin biopsy. We evaluated the expression of estrogen receptors and the mitogenic effect of 17 beta-estradiol and sulindac, a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory compound, on cell proliferation and collagen synthesis of desmoid cells. RESULTS: Proliferation and collagen synthesis of desmoid cells were stimulated by 17 beta-estradiol, and tamoxifen, an antiestrogenic compound, inhibited this effect. Desmoid cells also expressed estrogen receptors. Moreover, growth of desmoid cells from one of the patients was inhibited by sulindac. CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro evaluation of drug responsiveness in patients operated on for DT could be used as both a prognostic tool in the natural history of DT and in addressing pharmacologic therapy in this disorder."

"Abdominal desmoid tumor or fibromatosis is a benign non-urological connective tumor which can be mistaken for a urological tumor due to its localization (generally in muscles and aponeurosis of the abdominal wall). It is locally invasive and potentially recurrent. We report on a 53-year-old male with abdominal desmoid tumor whose only symptom was pain. The clinical diagnosis was corroborated by the US and CT findings and confirmed by anatomopathological findings. Wide local surgical excision is the treatment of choice since hormone therapy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy achieved scant results."
"A case of pericapsular desmoid tumor is presented. The MR features of signal hypointensity and association with the joint capsule suggested the diagnosis of focal PVNS or giant cell tumor of tendon sheath. Arguing against the diagnosis of PVNS were the absence of significant joint effusion, the unifocality of a fairly large lesion, and the absence of bony erosion. While nonspecific, the MR features in some cases of desmoid tumor may help to suggest the correct diagnosis."
"The fibromatoses represent a group of infiltrating fibrous proliferations that exhibit a clinical behavior and biologic potential intermediate between benign fibrous lesions and fibrosarcoma. The head and neck region is a common site of involvement for these lesions especially in children and young adults. However, the oral structures per se are not often the site of origin. In this study of 31 cases of fibromatosis that involved the oral and paraoral region, patient ages ranged from birth to 51 years with 74% appearing in the first decade. The most common clinical presentation was a painless mass that involved the cheek, tongue, or submandibular region. Erosion of bone was a frequent finding in lesions arising in soft tissue contiguous with the jaws. After surgical excision, lesions recurred in five patients for a recurrence rate of 23.8%. One lesion recurred twice. The average interval from initial treatment to recurrence was 7.6 months. The recurrence rate observed in this series is significantly lower than that generally reported for fibromatosis of the head and neck (50% to 70%). This is most likely due to the exclusion in this investigation of lesions in the supraclavicular region."

"The extra-abdominal aggressive fibromatosis is a locally aggressive non-metastasizing fibroproliferative tumor of the locomotive system with an extremely high recurrence rate. By means of a case report the treatment possibilities are discussed. The recommended treatment of choice is a wide resection where possible. The indications for radio-, chemo- or hormone therapy are presented."
"An intra-abdominal desmoid tumour included in Gardner's syndrome is described. Some aspects of this unusual tumour are reviewed, emphasizing the value of CT to evaluate shape, location, size and relation with adjacent structures and therefore to decide the therapeutic plan, to avoid the need for exploratory laparotomies which are, moreover, so inadvisable in these patients. Although the, treatment of choice is surgery, it must be performed in accordance with CT findings. When surgery is not possible is incomplete or after recurrences, alternative methods are recommended."
"A case of desmoid abdominal tumor is reported. This is a rare benign tumor often found in association with Gardner's syndrome. The radiological features with ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are presented. These explorations illustrate the infiltrating characteristics and the high potentially recurrence rate of desmoid tumor."
"Desmoids are rare, benign fibromatous lesions, which can arise in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a disorder caused by germline adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutation. This study investigated the risk of desmoids in FAP, the relation between specific APC gene mutations and desmoid formation, and the clinical characteristics of FAP patients with desmoids. Eighty three of 825 FAP patients (10%) from 49 of 161 kindreds (30%) had desmoids. The absolute risk of desmoids in FAP patients was 2.56/1000 person years; comparative risk was 852 times the general population. APC gene mutations were similar in families with and without desmoids. The female/male ratio was 1.4 (p = NS). Previous abdominal surgery was noted in 68% of patients with abdominal desmoids (55% developed within five years postoperatively). Desmoid risk in FAP family members of a desmoid patient was 25% in first degree relatives v 8% in third degree relatives. Desmoids are a comparatively common complication of FAP associated with surgical trauma and familial aggregation. Desmoid development was not linked to specific APC gene mutations and was not found predominantly in women. Studies of chemopreventive therapy, given within five years after abdominal surgery, should be considered in FAP patients with a family history of desmoid disease."
"The aim of this study was to describe the natural history and management of surgically unresectable intra-abdominal desmoid tumors in two patients with Gardner's syndrome from two unrelated families, where each had failed on conventional therapy. METHODS: Two patients with Gardner's syndrome were placed on a chemotherapy regimen which included doxorubicin (90 mg/m2) and dacarbazine (900 mg/m2) in divided doses over four days of continuous infusion. Their progress on chemotherapy was assessed by abdominal computerized tomography and laparoscopy. RESULTS: The computerized abdominal tomography scans proved difficult to interpret because of adhesions and matted small bowel resulting from the patients original colectomies. These findings made it difficult to differentiate postoperative changes from residual desmoid tumor. Second-look laparotomy in such patients was contraindicated as this may predispose to further desmoid production. Laparoscopy disclosed a complete response to this chemotherapy. Nevertheless, we had an iatrogenic small bowel perforation in one of these patients. Each patient showed a complete response to chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Surgical resection remains the first-line treatment of intraabdominal desmoid tumors. However, doxorubicin/dacarbazine chemotherapy on a clinical trial basis may be indicated in patients whose intra-abdominal desmoid is unresectable, or who have failed to respond to treatment with hormones (tamoxifen, Toremifene), steroids (prednisone), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (Clinoril; Merck & Co., Inc., West Point, PA)."
Fewer than 100 cases of desmoid tumor of the breast have been reported. We report the first recorded case of desmoid associated with silicone gel-filled implants.
"The authors present comparative triple-phase bone scan findings in three cases of histologically proven aggressive fibromatosis both before (initial evaluation) and after radiation therapy. The purpose of the study was to compare triple-phase bone scan findings in aggressive fibromatosis both before and after radiation therapy and to determine whether any additional physiological information could be obtained. Before radiation therapy, the triple-phase bone scintigraphy demonstrated increased flow and radiotracer pooling in the areas of tumors on dynamic flow and immediate blood pool images, respectively. However, the delayed static images demonstrated variable radiotracer uptake. When compared to preradiation therapy triple-phase bone scan, decreased vascularity was well demonstrated in all three patients after radiation therapy. In addition, it also provided information regarding the changes in the size and extent of tumor, noninvaded underlying bone, and remainder of the skeleton. This additional information can be particularly useful in patients with equivocal or questionable histologic diagnosis especially from small, unrepresentative biopsies."
"Sarcoma and normal tissue plasma membrane lectin-reactive glycoproteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two peanut agglutinin-reactive N-acetylgalactosamine-containing glycoproteins of 1.05 x 10(6) and 1.25 x 10(5) Da and one lentil agglutinin-reactive mannose/N-acetylglucosamine(-fucose)/sialic acid-containing glycoprotein of 1.7 x 10(5) Da (Gp170) were detected in osteosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), respectively. However, these glycoproteins were not detected in normal tissue plasma membranes. Concanavalin A, wheat germ and Ulex europaeus Type I agglutinins did not reveal any unique sarcoma-associated membrane glycoproteins. Preliminary studies on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) generated against Gp170 (mAb 64-35-84) and against lentil-reactive glycoproteins from MFH (mAbs 67-34 and 67-117) revealed high specific binding to a number of membranes isolated from MFH and osteosarcoma tissues, with no crossreactivity to normal human tissues tested (liver, spleen and skin). Detailed analysis of mAb 67-102, which was generated against lentil-reactive glycoproteins isolated from MFH plasma membranes, exhibited significant binding to membranes isolated from osteosarcoma, liposarcoma and MFH; moderate binding to synovial sarcoma, aggressive fibromatosis and fibrosarcoma; and minimal to no binding to other soft tissue sarcoma plasma membranes. No binding was observed to twenty normal tissue specimens, with the exception of low positive binding to two of five fat and two of three colon specimens."

"The desmoid tumor is a histologically benign neoplasm originating in muscular-aponeurotic structures and possesses a high tendency of local recurrence. The aggressive nature of the tumor obliges radical surgery to be performed principally in extra-abdominal tumors. METHODS: Twelve patients were treated from 1983 to 1993. The treatments performed prior to and after histologic diagnosis, the time of evolution when radical treatment was carried out upon diagnosis and the evolution after treatment were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the patients with desmoid tumor 8 were males with a mean age of 29.9 +/- 12.5 years. In eleven cases the presentation was as a tumor and was of pain in only one case. All the patients were surgically treated with a total of 27 interventions being carried out. Three patients also received pharmacologic treatment with tamoxifen, in 2 cases associated to sulindac. In two radiotherapy was used but not as a first line treatment. Following a mean follow up of 38 +/- 17 months no mortality has been registered but 5 patients are not disease free. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic attitude to the desmoid tumor should be radical surgery in both the primary tumor and the recurrences with medical treatment being performed in specific situations."
"Four cases of muscle-aponeurotic fibroadenomatosis (desmoid) of the abdominal wall are reported. The etiological factors, the recurrence rate, the treatment and the pre- and postoperative examinations are discussed."
"A retrospective study of abdominal CT scans of patients with proved intraabdominal desmoid tumors was done to determine if any objective characteristics exist to differentiate desmoids related to Gardner's syndrome from isolated desmoids. Because the desmoid tumors of Gardner's syndrome can predate the diagnosis of Gardner's syndrome, it would be helpful to know which patients with desmoids need careful follow-up studies as well as initial workup for Gardner's syndrome and all its ramifications. Also, it would be important to differentiate benign from malignant desmoids associated with Gardner's syndrome. It was hoped that the location, enhancement characteristics, and/or the presence or absence of infiltration might be of value. We were interested in noting if, over time, the growth characteristics of desmoids found in Gardner's syndrome were different from those of isolated desmoids. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed 101 abdominal CT scans obtained in 23 patients during a 13-year period. Forty desmoid tumors were intraabdominal, including 30 lesions associated with Gardner's syndrome in 13 patients and 10 desmoids of the idiopathic form in 10 patients. These tumors were studied to define location; whether they were single or multiple; and whether they had any specific CT characteristics regarding margins, attenuation numbers, or contrast enhancement. RESULTS: Desmoid tumors associated with Gardner's syndrome were more likely to be multiple (38%, five of 13 patients) and to involve the mesentery (60%, 18 of 30 tumors) and the abdominal wall (40%, 12 of 30 tumors), whereas isolated desmoid tumors were singular (all 10 patients) and were located in the retroperitoneum (six cases), pelvis (three), and anterior wall (one). Desmoids related to Gardner's syndrome also tended to be smaller (mean diameter, 4.8 cm) than idiopathic desmoids (mean diameter, 13.8 cm). No differentiating CT characteristics regarding margins, attenuation numbers, or response to contrast material were ascertained. Ten new lesions (seven intraabdominal, three mesenteric) developed in three patients with Gardner's syndrome, whereas no new intraabdominal lesions developed in patients with idiopathic desmoids. Follow-up data on 16 surgically resected desmoids in nine patients (seven with Gardner's syndrome and two with isolated desmoids) revealed seven local recurrences (two in the two patients with isolated desmoids and five in two patients with Gardner's syndrome). CONCLUSION: No CT characteristics, such as attenuation values, margins, and response to the contrast material, were found that would enable differentiation between isolated intraabdominal desmoids and those associated with Gardner's disease. Desmoid tumors associated with Gardner's syndrome tend to occur in the mesentery and abdominal wall, whereas isolated desmoids involve the retroperitoneum and pelvis. When studying CT scans obtained over time, new lesions were noted to develop in a few of the patients with Gardner's syndrome (three of 13), whereas no new lesions were found in patients with isolated desmoids."
"The aim of this study was to determine what factors may be responsible for the development of a stricture at the pouch-anal anastomosis after restorative proctocolectomy. METHODS: A consecutive series of 115 patients was studied retrospectively a median of 34 months (range, 4-100 months) after operation or ileostomy closure. The procedure failed in 11 patients (9.6 percent) who subsequently had to have a permanent ileostomy. Another two patients were excluded from the analysis, one of whom was awaiting ileostomy closure, whereas the other had a stricture due to a desmoid tumor. Of the remaining 102 patients, 39 (38 percent) developed an ileoanal anastomotic stricture, which was severe and persistent in 16 percent. RESULTS: The results were analyzed with the aid of multivariate logistic regression analysis. Factors which predisposed significantly to the development of an ileoanal anastomotic stricture were 1) use of the 25-mm (small) diameter stapling gun (P = 0.05), 3) use of a defunctioning ileostomy (P = 0.03), and 4) anastomotic dehiscence and pelvic sepsis (P = 0.03). The single patient whose operation failed because of a stricture had also developed pelvic sepsis associated with an anastomotic dehiscence. CONCLUSIONS: The eventual clinical, functional outcome after dilation of a stricture in the 39 patients who developed a stricture was as good as the outcome in the 63 patients who did not a develop stricture."

A very large mesenteric desmoid tumour was found in a 19-year-old man. The tumour could be excised with free margins and no further therapy was given. One year after the operation the patient does well without any signs of recurrence.
"A case report of a feminine patient who complained of nasal ventilatory obstruction and nasosinusal polyposis is presented. She underwent surgery and the pathological study revealed the existence of an aggressive fibromatosis. The AA. review the literature dealing with this illness and explain an update state of the clinical features, treatment and the course of this rare entity, closely related to fibrosarcoma."
"The very rare condition of multicentric desmoid tumours involving two distant and apparently independent sites is reported in a 17-year-old man. The tumours grew simultaneously and reached approximately equal size. No evidence of familiar polyposis or any other feature of Gardner's syndrome were noted. The proximal desmoid tumour developed from the left hip region and extended into the femoral bone, whereas the distal mass was attached to the left popliteal fossa infiltrating the flexor muscles, the nerves and vessels. On the basis of the good results published recently in the literature and our own earlier experiences, the intralesional resection of the desmoid tumours was completed with postoperative fractionated radiotherapy."
"As the survival duration and cure rate of children with malignant conditions improve, awareness of long-term side effects is crucial. Two case reports demonstrate long-term changes in dentition and orofacial development in children who had been treated for facial malignant conditions. Changes induced mandibular and maxillary hypoplasia, partial anodontia, microdontia, altered eruption pattern, root stunting, and altered amelogenesis."
"A case of abdominal wall desmoid which enlarged toward the liver and mimicked an intra-abdominal tumor is presented. T*2-weighted MR images clearly demonstrated the tumor's continuity with the rectus abdominis muscle. The case presented suggests MRI may provide more valuable information concerning the origin of a right-upper-quadrant mass than CT does. However, the nature of the signals and attachment which this case showed were so unusual for desmoids that this case has not been diagnosed accurately."
This is the first report of a desmoid tumor 19 years after radiation therapy for seminoma of the testis at the age of 40. It stresses the need to include the desmoid tumor in the differential diagnosis of an intra-abdominal tumor after treatment of testicular cancer as well as the possible radiation induction of desmoid tumor.

"12E7 is a monoclonal antibody to the MIC2 gene product and can be applied to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. The diagnostic utility of 12E7 as a marker of Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral neuroectodermal tumour was assessed. Immunocytochemical studies were performed on 120 small round-cell tumours from children and adolescents. Immunoreactivity for 12E7 was seen in 13 of 15 Ewing's sarcomas. 14 of 15 peripheral neuroectodermal tumours, four of 14 embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, seven of 11 T-lymphoblastic lymphomas and one T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Immunoreactivity was located on the cell-membrane of Ewing's sarcomas, peripheral neuroectodermal tumours and lymphoid tumours while rhabdomyosarcomas showed weak, cytoplasmic staining in differentiated rhabdomyoblasts. Studies on alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas (n = 10), acute myeloid leukaemias (3), B-lymphoblastic lymphomas (8), blastema-rich nephroblastomas (9), neuroblastomas (20) and retinoblastomas (10) as well as single examples of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Ki-1 anaplastic lymphoma of indeterminate phenotype and intra-abdominal desmoplastic tumour with divergent differentiation were negative. 12E7 is a sensitive marker for the Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal group of tumours and is useful in distinguishing them from neuroblastoma and blastema-rich nephroblastoma. However, immunopositivity for 12E7 should be interpreted in conjunction with the results of neural and lymphoid markers."

"Desmoid tumors are locally aggressive tumors, with no metastatic potential, that generally are amenable to local treatments, such as surgery and radiation therapy. Systemic therapy is considered for selected cases that are not amenable to local treatment. METHODS: The authors reviewed their experience with chemotherapy in desmoid tumors. A patient population was identified through a search of the data base maintained by the Department of Patient Studies. RESULTS: Between January 1971 and December 1991, 180 patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of desmoid tumor were seen at the authors' institution. Twelve patients (8 male and 4 female patients; age range, 16-66 years; median age, 29 years) received chemotherapy. Eleven patients received doxorubicin (60-90 mg/m2) plus dacarbazine (750-1000 mg/m2)-based regimens for a median of 5 cycles (2-10 cycles). Six of the nine patients who could be evaluated for response had an objective response (two complete responses and four partial responses), one patient had a minor response, and two patients had stable disease. Two other patients treated in the early 1970s could not be evaluated objectively because of lack of modern imaging; however, they were reported to have ""responses"" that enabled resection of axillary and pelvic disease. All four patients with Gardner syndrome experienced disease response. One of these four patients had a complete response twice with doxorubicin-based chemotherapy and eventually died with an ejection fraction of 0.22. Five patients are alive with no evidence of disease (NED), four are alive with disease, and two are lost to follow-up after having an NED status at their last visit. CONCLUSION: The authors conclude that desmoid tumors in adults are responsive to chemotherapy, and such treatment should be considered before embarking on radical treatment to avoid obvious functional consequences and delayed complications."
"A 57-year-old woman with L-tryptophan-induced eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, 23 months after the onset of symptoms, experienced development of a parasternal malignant fibrous histiocytoma on previously scleroderma-like skin areas and, almost concurrently, an extraabdominal desmoid tumor of the left arm muscle fascia. The malignant fibrous histiocytoma was treated by surgical excision without sign of recurrence or metastasis 19 months later. Radiation therapy was performed on the extraabdominal desmoid tumor. We suspect that these two connective tissue tumors in this patient were related to the exposure to contaminated L-tryptophan, which interfered with connective tissue metabolism."
"Fibromatoses form an interesting group of tumors occupying a midposition in the spectrum of fibrous tissue neoplasms. Within the fibromatoses subgroups there exists a variety of tumors whose clinical behavior spans the range from completely benign to locally aggressive. Four case histories are presented to illustrate this point. All four patients were initially seen with asymptomatic head or neck masses. The first had complete excision with no recurrence to date. The second underwent spontaneous regression after confirmation of diagnosis with biopsy. The third case had a very locally aggressive disease requiring three surgical resections to date, while the last case had one recurrence after the initial resection. With certain exceptions, initial wide local excision offers the best possible chance for cure."
"This study examines the natural history of patients treated for multifocal desmoids at a referral center for sarcomas. METHODS: Patients with multifocal desmoids seen at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in the 9-year period between 1982 and 1991 were identified through a prospective sarcoma data base. The clinical histories were reviewed. In addition, tumor estrogen and progesterone receptor status were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: This rare condition occurred in six (4.8%) of the 124 patients with desmoid tumors and all occurred in premenopausal women. In each instance the tumors were restricted to one anatomic region of the body and no patient had familial polyposis or Gardner's syndrome. When tested immunohistochemically, the tumors displayed no nuclear reactivity for estrogen or progesterone receptors. CONCLUSIONS: Further investigative work must be undertaken before considering routine use of antiestrogen therapy even in this subset of patients with desmoid tumors."
"Desmoid tumors, which are locally invasive with recurrence but without metastasis, are frequently observed in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis after abdominal surgery or during pregnancy. This study analyzed mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene in 8 desmoid tumors from 7 familial adenomatous polyposis patients using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and the direct sequencing method. Seven somatic mutations, 1 somatic allele loss, and 6 germ-line mutations were detected. The majority of adenomatous polyposis coli gene mutations were deletions of 1 to 19 base pairs in exon 15, and all mutations led to the formation of stop codons. A somatic mutation with repetition of 82 base pairs from codon 1399 to 1426 was also observed in a desmoid, which was most likely caused by an error during replication or repair replication. No mutation was detected in exons 1 to 2 of H-ras, K-ras, and N-ras genes and in exons 5 to 8 of p53 gene, in these tumors. The simultaneous existence of somatic and germ-line alterations of adenomatous polyposis coli gene observed in all 8 tumors strongly suggests that inactivation of both alleles of adenomatous polyposis coli gene is involved in the development of desmoid tumors."

"Abdominal desmoid tumors (ADT) have become an important problem because of the increased survival of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Of 240 patients operated upon for FAP between 1978 and 1991, 29 (16 men and 13 women) had ADT. Diagnosis was made at laparotomy in 19 patients, while an abdominal mass or intestinal obstruction was the principal cause of discovery in the ten remaining patients. Twenty ADT were discovered after a previous laparotomy performed an average of three years earlier. Nine ADT occurred in 146 patients who had previously undergone a coloproctectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and eight occurred in 74 patients who had abdominal colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis. Desmoid tumors were responsible for eight instances of intestinal obstruction and one instance of small intestinal perforation. One death was directly related to ADT. In four of nine patients, ADT was responsible for a deterioration of the functional results of ileoanal anastomosis, but pouch removal was not necessary. Conversion of ileorectal anastomosis to ileoanal anastomosis and excision of carcinomas that occur in the residual rectum after ileorectal anastomosis were impossible because of ADT in three and two patients, respectively. Complete surgical removal of the tumor was possible in seven patients only and four patients had a recurrence. None of the medical therapies used (sulindac, tamoxifen and chemotherapy) were effective. The results of this study confirm the high incidence, severity and absence of effective treatment of ADT in FAP. Desmoid tumors occurring after ileorectal anastomosis seem to be more severe than after ileoanal anastomosis because, in the former instance, they may interfere with the further management of the rectal stump."

"Twenty-six patients with desmoid tumors of the extremities (n = 20) or trunk (n = 6) have been treated since 1977. Nine of these were referred with primary tumors and 17 with recurrent tumors. METHODS: The tumor was removed in all patients, and 10 received adjuvant radiation. Five patients (19%) developed local recurrence; one of them was lost to follow-up, and the remaining four patients had the recurrence controlled with surgical resection or resection plus adjuvant radiation. RESULTS: All 25 patients who have been followed are alive and disease-free at a mean follow-up of 84 months (median, 81 months). None with extremity tumors (n = 20) required an amputation. The estimated survival rate for the entire group is 95% at 42 months. CONCLUSIONS: Desmoid tumor of the trunk or extremities treated with surgical resection, supplemented selectively by adjuvant radiation, can be controlled locally in the majority (96%) of patients."
"Desmoid tumours present difficult management problems in patients with Gardner's syndrome. We recently studied two patients with Gardner's syndrome, who developed a desmoid tumour arising of the abdominal wall and mesenteric root. One patient had a total resection of the mesenteric desmoid tumour followed by postoperative radiotherapy. No recurrence occurred in the last three years. The other patient had an incomplete resection and refused postoperative radiotherapy. Abdominal CT scan revealed tumour expansion 6 months postoperatively. From our experience and with respect to current literature, we suggest that complete surgical excision combined with radiotherapy (4.000-6.000 rads) could diminish the recurrence rate of desmoid tumours. When resection is incomplete or technically impossible, radiotherapy remains the second choice of treatment."
"The authors demonstrate in a group of 10 patients treated in the course of 15 years the rare incidence of aggressive fibromatosis of the extremities and the large number of relapses after surgery. They also emphasize the necessity of detailed preoperative examination, priority of a surgical approach, as compared with radiotherapeutic procedures, and the possibility of skeletal and vascular reconstruction after radical surgery."
"Sixty-three patients with malignant and benign tumors of soft tissues were examined making use of magnetic resonance computer-aided tomography (MRT). This method was found effective in the diagnosis of soft tissue tumors, permitting the detection of tumor connection with the adjacent structures. In some cases MRT helped differentiate between malignant and benign soft tissue tumor growth, e.g. liposarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, lipoma, desmoid, hematoma. MRT may be effectively used in the diagnosis of soft tissue formations."

"To determine the efficacy of different treatment modalities for desmoid tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the treatment of 40 patients with histologically confirmed desmoid tumors seen at Duke University Medical Center between 1974 and 1990. RESULTS: Radiotherapy was administered to 16 patients (Group I)--14 with recurrent disease s/p surgery and in two as initial treatment. The average size of the irradiated lesions was 9.3 +/- 3.9 X 8.4 +/- 3.5 cm. With a median follow-up of 57.5 months and a median administered dose of 5400 cGy (mean 5286 cGy, range 4960-5620 cGy), local control has been obtained in 15/16 patients (94%). Complete regression (5/16), partial regression (5/16), or stable disease (5/16) was produced in 15 patients while one patient failed and was salvaged via gross total resection. Continued regression has been seen up to 60 months after treatment. Fourteen patients underwent primary gross total resection and two underwent subtotal resection (Group II). None received post-operative radiotherapy. Three of 14 patients (21%) recurred after gross total resection. All three were salvaged with subsequent gross total resection. After subtotal resection, 2/2 patients recurred. With a mean follow-up of 52 months, 14 patients are without evidence of disease, one is dead with disease (unrelated cause of death), and one was lost to follow-up after recurrence. Eight patients have been treated with combinations of chemotherapy, NSAIDS, anti-estrogens, and immunotherapy with mixed results (Group III). A subset of seven patients with retroperitoneal disease taken from all three groups had large tumor burden (mean size 17 X 15 cm), an infiltrative nature, as well as a difficult location. The disease was surgically resectable in three patients. One is without evidence of disease 9 years after gross total resection alone. Disease has been stabilized with radiotherapy in the other two patients after multiple unsuccessful surgical resections. Of four patients with unresectable disease, two are dead of disease, one died of unrelated causes with disease, and regression of disease was obtained in the other with Gamma-interferon after unsuccessful treatment with tamoxifen and vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Gross total resection is the indicated initial therapy, if it can be performed without significant disfigurement. Radiotherapy is also excellent for obtaining local control, even in patients with a large burden of recurrent disease. Doses in the range of 50 to 55 Gy give a chance of local control equal to that obtained with higher doses previously reported."
"The treatment of extraabdominal desmoid tumors remains controversial. Although a radical resection is associated with lower recurrence rates, the treatment of extensive, limb-threatening, or multifocal desmoids may require a more conservative excision with postoperative radiation and selective hormonal therapy. This approach would minimize functional deficits and improve cosmesis. If conservative resection with adjuvant radiotherapy and endocrine manipulation has failed and the tumor is compromising vital functions, then more radical resections may be justified."
"Nera-Verzasca, Tessin mountain goat). Macroscopically, the disease was characterized by glassy, whitish, very hard, plate-forming masses found in the abdominal wall and in the medial aspect of the upper hind limbs. Histologically, the masses consisted of well differentiated fibroblasts which locally infiltrated the surrounding tissues. No capsule formation was found. On electron microscopy, the cells appeared to be active, young, collagen-producing fibroblasts. The pathogenesis of this disease is unknown."
"Aggressive fibromatosis of the facial nerve is a very rare tumor. Three cases have been previously reported. The tumor is locally recurrent and often has a fatal outcome. This report is of a ten-year-old boy whose tumor originally developed in the parotid area with subsequent spread to the base of the skull, the neck and the cerebellopontine angle. Treatment was by wide surgical excision, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Despite treatment, the patient died. The clinical features of this case will be described. Only wide surgical excision early in the course of the disease may offer a chance for cure."
"We report a case of a 18-year-old male patient with his fourth relapse of a desmoid tumour of the left popliteal hollow after a traumatism in this area. Arterial displacement and extrinsic compression were showed by arteriography. Tumoration was extirpated including popliteal artery, in this way a terminal by-pass from distal femoral to peroneo-tibial trunks with contralateral great saphena was made. Diagnosis of intestinal polyposis and of the little osseous malformations, was discarded these pathologies frequently are related with these tumours. The research for 8 years and 4 months doesn't show any relapse, nor local neither multicentral. Furthermore, some considerations about this theme are reported."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a locally invasive, non-metastasizing tumour of fibrous origin and variable radiologic appearance. The authors describe a child with intrathoracic aggressive fibromatosis that mimicked congenital malformation of the lung."
"As desmoid tumors invade locally and postoperative recurrence is common, accurate diagnosis of the extent of the tumor is needed prior to surgery. CT and/or MRI evaluation of tumor extension was retrospectively studied in eight patients with desmoid tumors, and the results were correlated with the histopathological findings. All tumors were completely resected even in patients who were evaluated by CT alone. However, the delineation of tumor and local invasion were not clearly demonstrated by CT. On the other hand, the delineation of tumor and local invasion were well visualized on MRI. The MRI picture of desmoid tumors was mainly composed of two different areas of signal intensity. The area of hypointensity in both T 1- and T 2-weighted images was found to have abundant collagen fibers, while the area of isointensity or slight hyperintensity in T 1-weighted images and hyperintensity in T 2-weighted images was found to have fibroblasts. In conclusion, MRI is better suited to the evaluation of patients with desmoid tumors than CT."
"Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis (IRF) is an uncommon disease of obscure etiology and pathobiology. Using sections of frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue, an immunohistochemical technique, and antibodies to a variety of macrophage- and lymphocyte-associated antigens, we studied six examples of IRF. The results showed a large population of spindle-shaped cells that expressed the immunophenotype of a tissue macrophage, that is, Leu 3a,b (CD4)+, MY7 (CD13)+, Leu M5 (CD11c)+, KP-1 and EBM-11 (CD68)+, human leukocyte antigen (HLA-DR)+, leukocyte common antigen (CD45)+, HAM-56+, and MAC387+. A subpopulation of these cells also reacted with an antibody to the ""activation"" antigen, interleukin 2R (CD25). A control group of ""fibroblastic"" lesions including keloids, desmoid tumors, and an aggressive fibromatosis displayed minimal reactivity with this panel of antibodies. The abundance of macrophages suggests that they may play an important role in the pathogenesis of IRF. If, as has been suggested by some studies, IRF is an immune-mediated phenomenon, the macrophages may be triggered to produce cytokines that stimulate fibroblast proliferation and subsequent fibrosis that characterize this disease."

"Desmoid tumors are accounted among histologically benign soft tissue tumors. Though metastases do not occur the clinical course of the disease with their tendency to grow locally aggressive and to relapse after curative intended surgery is similar to sarcomas. After surgical excision adjuvant therapy of desmoid tumors is necessary in such cases, where a radical excision with a wide margin is not possible, or must be doubted or after the surgical excision of a locally recurrent tumor. Radiation doses of 50 to 60 Gy reduce the risk of local recurrence of desmoid tumors to 18%. In such cases, where surgery and radiotherapy have been leading to incomplete responses, systemic therapy with hormones (tamoxifen or progesterone), with alkylating agents (e. g. ifosfamide) or with prostaglandin antagonists (indomethacin) is possible. The published data on therapeutic responses to the treatment of desmoid tumors are scarce. We are reporting on seven of our own cases, treated with surgery and radiotherapy (four) or with a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, hormones and chemotherapy (three)."
"Desmoids are rare lesions that are histologically benign but locally aggressive. These lesions should be considered in patients who present with abdominal masses, particularly if there is a prior history of familial polyposis. This case report describes a patient with an abdominal desmoid that demonstrated atypical features on computed tomography and correlative magnetic resonance images."
"Desmoid tumors are the source of significant morbidity and mortality in patients with Gardner syndrome. METHODS: The authors present a case report and review of the literature. RESULTS: A young woman with an extensive abdominal desmoid had a prolonged response to doxorubicin after she did not respond to more conventional treatments. CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of the successful treatment of desmoids with doxorubicin used as a single agent. Reports of the efficacy of chemotherapy in these and related tumors are reviewed."
"A case of familial adenomatosis coli with large intra-abdominal desmoid tumors is described. The patient initially complained of an abdominal mass, which was diagnosed as a desmoid tumor after surgical resection. Further examinations revealed numerous polyps of the colon which were histologically diagnosed as adenomas. Despite intensive medical therapy, the desmoid tumors rapidly increased in size and number, and resulted in abscess and cavity formation that involved the ileum. Although desmoid tumors are classically benign in nature, we consider these tumors to be a therapeutic problem in patients with familial adenomatosis coli."
"Intraoperative irradiation with electrons was used in conjunction with external beam irradiation and maximal surgical resection in 20 patients with locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas or desmoids. This manuscript presents results with regard to tolerance of treatment and its impact on tumor control and survival. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten patients presented with previously untreated primary sarcomas and 10 at the time of local recurrence (two had recurrent desmoid tumors). Tumor location was retroperitoneal in 19 and in the low anterior neck in one. A partial or gross total resection was performed prior to the external beam or intraoperative component of irradiation in every patient, but all had positive resection margins. Patients received 4500-6000 cGy of fractionated, external beam irradiation and an IORT dose of 1000-2000 cGy. Chemotherapy was given only at the time of disease progression. RESULTS: Fourteen of 20 patients (70%) were alive; 11 (55%) were free of disease (4/10 primary, 7/10 recurrent), but 1 required hemipelvectomy for salvage. Progression within the intraoperative irradiation field was documented in only 1 patient (5%) and within the external beam field in 3/20 (15%). Blood born distant metastasis occurred in 5 patients (25%) and peritoneal seeding in 1 (5%). The distant failure incidence by grade was 1/8 (13%) for Grades 1, 2 and 5/12 (42%) for Grades 3, 4. Only 1 patient (5%) developed a > or = severe neuropathy, and small bowel obstruction requiring exploration also occurred in a single patient. CONCLUSION: In view of acceptable tolerance and the high current rate of local tumor control, in spite of incomplete surgical resections, further evaluation of intraoperative irradiation as a component of treatment is indicated for locally advanced primary and recurrent soft tissue sarcomas."
"The fibromatoses are a group of benign proliferations of fibrous tissue with clinical behavior ranging from that of truly malignant tumors to that of benign reactive fibrous proliferations. Some of the superficial fibromatoses are fairly common, but the deep ones, also known as desmoid tumors or musculoaponeurotic fibromatoses, are rare. Idiopathic multicentric osteolysis is a rare skeletal disorder of childhood that causes progressive destruction of bones and renal failure. We recently saw a young girl with both extraabdominal musculoaponeurotic fibromatosis and idiopathic multicentric osteolysis. The classification, diagnosis, and treatment of the deep fibromatoses are reviewed, and the possible association between the minor bone changes occasionally reported in musculoaponeurotic fibromatosis and idiopathic multicentric osteolysis is discussed."
"Sarcomas and other aggressive neoplasms of the extremities present particular challenges for limb salvage when the tumors are located distally in the arms or legs. These tumors require a large area of excision, yet there are no suitable options for local tissue coverage. In the past, amputation was often necessary due to the inability to adequately reconstruct the extremity. We performed immediate free tissue transfers on 10 patients with aggressive tumors in the forearm and lower leg. Eight patients had sarcomas, 1 had a melanoma, and 1 had a recurrent fibromatosis. Seven patients had rectus abdominis flaps, 1 had a latissimus dorsi flap, 1 had a groin flap, and 1 had an osteocutaneous flap from the iliac crest. Three patients had tendon transfers at the time of surgery. Four patients required radiation therapy after resection due to the high-grade nature of their neoplasms. The flaps tolerated the radiation well, with only 1 patient sustaining flap necrosis that required skin grafting. Average follow-up was 28 months. All patients are alive and none had local recurrences of their tumors. All free flaps have survived and remained durable. There have been no late breakdowns of skin grafts, and all tendon transfers have functioned well. Immediate free tissue transfer provides an excellent method of reconstruction for distal tumors of the extremities."
"Two cases of desmoid tumor of the abdominal wall are reported, together with some considerations and a review of the literature; desmoid tumor is an unusual neoplasm which affects women in prevalence. This is an histologically benign neoplasm with no metastatic capacity; however it is highly invasive in the site where it arose, so its treatment can become very difficult. The treatment is by surgical excision that must be as wide as possible, in order to obviate the great incidence of recurrence. The role of radiotherapy, hormone and chemotherapy has not been completely assessed so far."
"Besides the pathological findings, the lesion does not recur or metastasize more than 2 years after operation or it does recur, but still shows benign features histologically. As for treatment, marginal or wide excision is the procedure of choice."

"Aggressive juvenile fibromatosis, though allegedly a benign process, is as frustrating to manage as it is perplexing to comprehend. The treatment is primarily surgical, with chemotherapy and radiation therapy recently finding support as adjuncts in selected circumstances. Though there is no agreement regarding the etiology of fibromatosis, many have suspected hormonal or traumatic influences. There has been historical, clinical and experimental data demonstrating that fibromatosis seems to be under the influence of estrogen. There have also been anecdotal reports that this tumor has regressed with the use of tamoxifen. To our knowledge, no one has tested these tissues for the presence of estrogen/progesterone receptors. Recently, over a short period of time, we at Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, have treated four youngsters with this disorder. All operative specimens were submitted for estrogen and progesterone assays. Although these cases were indistinguishable on histologic examination, two of the four exhibited the presence of estrogen/progesterone receptors. We propose, that from these observations, there potentially may be derived a histochemical classification based upon the presence or absence of estrogen/progesterone receptors. This would serve as an added reference in the definition and treatment of this disease. Should hormonal receptors be present, agents such as tamoxifen conceivably could be employed as part of a post-operative maintenance regimen similar to those protocols applied in the management of hormonally responsive breast cancer."
"Plantar fibromas are a disease entity that are encountered by all foot surgeons. When a tentative diagnosis is made, aggressive surgical resection of the mass and the plantar fascia is necessary to prevent recurrence. Presented in this paper is a review of the literature and clinical illustrations of recurrent plantar fibromatosis with long-term follow-up."
"(1) to present an unusual case of melorheostosis of the right hand, beginning in infancy, with serial radiographic studies to show the gradual progression of the disease; and (2) to present the first case with the development of ""aggressive"" fibromatosis (desmoid tumor) of the adjacent soft tissues, associated with melorheostosis."
"Magnetic resonance imaging is used widely to investigate soft tissue masses. The effectiveness of MRI derives from unrivaled soft tissue contrast and multiplanar imaging capability. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used to examine the phosphometabolites of normal and pathological soft tissues. We review the role of MRI and MRS in the detection and characterization of soft tissue masses and in staging soft tissue malignancies. The detection of a soft tissue mass depends on image contrast between normal and pathological tissue. We review the salient factors, both intrinsic properties of tissues and parameters of MR imaging, which influence soft tissue contrast on an MR image. Specific pulse sequences that have been compared for tumor detection are discussed. One goal of a radiological test is to provide tissue-specific characterization. Alone or in combination, various MR imaging characteristics of a soft tissue mass have been studied for an association with benign or malignant tissue. MR imaging signs discussed in this review include signal intensity, relaxation time, homogeneity of signal pattern, septation, size at presentation, shape, margin definition, peritumoral edema, involvement of bone or neurovascular tissue, and contrast enhancement. The MR imaging appearance of hemangioma, lipoma, pigmented villonodular synovitis, desmoid tumor, hematoma, arteriovenous malformation, and ganglion cyst is also reviewed. MR imaging is the quintessential imaging method for staging a soft tissue malignancy. We review three staging systems in common use and the role of MR imaging for local staging of untreated and treated soft tissue malignancies."

"Surgical treatment of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) remains controversial. The arguments in favour of ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) are well known. All the premalignant mucosa is removed and the risk of rectal carcinoma is avoided. Recent studies have compared results of IPAA and ileo rectal anastomosis (IRA). Morbidity is higher after IPAA, but it does not seem to influence the functional result, and it has to be compared with discomfort of subsequent rectal fulgurations. Functional result of these two procedures is very similar. The risk of occurrence of desmoid tumor is also similar. But desmoid tumor can interfere with the planned treatment and conversion of IRA to IPAA is not always feasible. Furthermore, it is suggested that desmoid tumour could be promoted by iterative surgical trauma. We conclude that it is preferable to perform directly the best and definitive operation and that IPAA is for us the procedure of choice in FAP, except in case of low rectal cancer or extensive colic cancer."
"Extra-abdominal desmoid is an unusual and underreported tumour in dermatological literature. We report a new case of such a lesion which was subjected to light, electron-microscopic and immunohistochemical studies. The results showed that proliferating cells exhibit features of myofibroblasts, both at the ultrastructural study (presence of cytoplasmic myofilaments) and the immunohistochemical study (cytoplasmic expression of vimentin and muscle-specific actin). Since these findings strongly suggest that desmoid tumour originates from myofibroblasts the term (extra-abdominal) ""myofibroblastoma"" could be proposed."
"We report the case of a 19 year-old female patient who consulted for a recurrent desmoid tumor of the back which had initially developed during childhood. Its clinical aspect was reminiscent of a localized subcutaneous tumor, but surgical exploration revealed multiple ramified extensions spreading over a wide area deep into the underlying muscular tissue. In spite of two attempts at wide surgery, complete resection was not achieved. EAD tumors are a distinct category between fibromatosis and fibrosarcoma. There is a direct contrast between the benign histological structure and the lack of a metastatic potential, and the fact that they are highly aggressive locally with a great proportion of relapses occurring after resection. Prognosis, which is good in terms of survival, is determinant in the choice of treatment which must remain conservative in the majority of cases. Wide, non mutilating surgery offers the best chances of cure without sequelae. When surgery may be mutilating, 50-60 Gy of radiotherapy (RT) is a good alternative and affords a high rate of complete regression over a long period of time. The value of adjuvant RT after surgical resection has yet to be determined. Hormonotherapy and other drugs are currently being evaluated."
Desmoid tumor are rare connective tissue tumors currently considered as sarcoma of low grade malignancy. They are most often encountered in young women of child-bearing years. Abdominal localisation is the most frequent site. The main aim of treatment is to avoid recurrences. We report a case of desmoid tumor developing in the thoracic cage in a patient who had been operated on six years earlier for an epidermoid carcinoma of bronchus.

"The distribution of the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM; CD56) was studied immunohistochemically in acetone-fixed frozen sections of 83 soft tissue tumors and selected normal mesenchymal tissue using Leu-19 monoclonal antibody and avidin-biotin peroxidase immunostaining. Positive N-CAM immunostaining was found in gastrointestinal and uterine cells but not in vascular smooth muscle cells. Normal skeletal muscle was negative, but atrophic muscle fibers within tumors were positive. Strong and consistent immunoreactivity was seen in nerves, pheochromocytoma, malignant schwannoma, and spindle cells, but not in epithelial-like cells of synovial sarcoma, hemangiopericytoma, benign leiomyoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma. Variable staining was seen in benign schwannoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Limited, usually focal N-CAM immunoreactivity was seen in desmoid tumor, dermatofibrosarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma. Although the N-CAM is consistently seen in neural tumors, it is not cell lineage specific. Changes on malignant transformation (comparing corresponding benign and malignant lesions) do not show any consistent pattern. Rather, there is neoexpression of the N-CAM in rhabdomyosarcoma, whereas there is loss of the N-CAM in leiomyosarcoma. Immunohistochemistry of the N-CAM can be a useful adjunct for characterization of soft tissue tumors, and its possible correlation with tumor behavior has to be examined in further studies."
"mild and aggressive fibromatoses, and fibrosarcoma. In both tissue biopsies and derivative cell lines, the proto-oncogenes junB and c-jun are induced in the latter two stages, in contrast to junD and fos. Fibrosarcoma cell lines have increased AP-1 DNA-binding activity. Overexpression of junB or c-jun by transfection into the mild fibromatosis stage elicited changes in cell shape and anchorage independence, whereas junD did not. Similar transfections of normal skin fibroblasts had no effect. Thus, junB and c-jun represent progression factors whose activities are necessary at an intermediate stage of tumor development, subsequent to the initiation of aberrant proliferation."
"Desmoid tumors are rare lesions with a local invasive potential and a risk of recurrence considered as benign due to the absence of metastases. They are included in fibromatoses and may be associated with Gardner's syndrome. The authors report an unusual case, in a 26 year old man, of a desmoid tumor invading ileon, right colon, appendix and the right ureter and responsible of a ureteral obstruction. Etiologic factors (traumatic, hormonal, auto-immune...) are discussed. The treatment of choice to lower the risk of recurrence is the complete surgical removal of the tumor."
"13 with osteosarcoma, 3 with chondrosarcoma, 5 with malignant fibrous histiocytoma, 1 with desmoid tumor, 1 with Ewing's, 2 with hemangioendothelioma, 1 with myxoid liposarcoma, 1 with synovial cell sarcoma, and 1 with rhabdomyosarcoma. Fifteen patients had follow-up MRS examinations after commencement of chemotherapy (mean of five/patient), eight of whom have now had surgery. Elevated levels of PMEs (P < 0.01), P(i) (P < 0.01), and PDEs (P < 0.02) as well as elevated tumor pH (P < 0.05) were observed in all patients. The synovial cell sarcoma was characterized by high levels of PMEs (> 20%) and low pH (pH 6.76). This contrasted with the spectra obtained from the malignant fibrous histiocytomas which had high levels of PDEs (17 +/- 5%). Reductions in PDE levels postchemotherapy were associated with a high degree of necrosis (> 90%) at surgery, while an increase in PDE levels was associated with a low level of histological necrosis. Likewise, reductions in the ratios PDE/NTP and PDE/PCr and an increase in P(i)/PDE were also associated with a high level of necrosis."
"Desmoid tumors, in general, are known for their propensity to recur. To evaluate treatment and results, we reviewed the records of 32 patients admitted to our institution with a chest wall desmoid tumor from 1948 to 1988. There were 13 men and 19 women whose ages ranged from 12 to 67 years (median 36 years). Four patients had Gardner's syndrome. Treatment was wide resection. Median follow-up was 110 months. The overall 5-year survival was 93%; 5-year disease-free survival was 71%. The 5-year local recurrence rate was 29%. Since death from disease is uncommon after resection, but local recurrence is common, we recommend aggressive wide resection in patients who have desmoid tumors of the chest wall when seen initially."
"The authors report a case of left abdominal rectum muscle desmoid tumor which has been surgically treated. After some considerations of the particular pathogenetic, anatomopathological and clinical characteristics of this neoplasm, they state that a precise preoperative diagnosis is always difficult, in spite of modern diagnostic means. They conclude that, nowadays, surgical extirpation is the most reliable therapeutical method, although it is burdened by a consistent incidence of local recidives (over 30%)."
"A retrospective study of fibromatoses and related diseases was performed on a series of 34 children. Aggressive forms of fibromatoses similar to those in adults as well as typical forms of childhood fibromatoses and fibrous proliferations, such as sternocleidomastoid tumor, infantile myofibromatosis, digital fibromatosis and fibrous hamartoma were observed. Immunohistochemistry revealed muscle specific actin in eleven out of 13 cases, including hyaline cytoplasmic inclusions in digital fibromatosis. In two patients with infantile myofibromatosis a coexpression of actin and desmin was found. One of two cases of infantile type of aggressive fibromatosis was weakly actin positive whereas the other was negative. This result suggests poorly differentiated character of cells in infantile fibromatosis. Clinicopathologic correlation showed that extraabdominal fibromatoses had a strong propensity for local recurrence. Multiple lesions affecting different muscle groups were diagnosed in two boys. Abdominal fibromatosis affected two girls and two boys, in contrast to adult forms which occur exclusively in women."
"Fibromatosis is often found in the anterior abdominal wall of parous women. It occurs rarely in the chest wall and is rarely found in children. Our case was a 7-year-old male patient with a rapid-growing, painless tumor in the right anterior chest wall for 6 months. He received a resection of the tumor, the bilateral clavicular heads, the upper-third of the sternum and segments of the first and second ribs bilaterally. Reconstruction was conducted by transposition of the pectoralis major muscle and a prosthesis of wire mesh with methyl methacrylate. Histologically, the tumor showed dense collagenous tissue consistent with mature aggressive fibromatosis. It was a benign tumor without distant metastatic potential but with an aggressive clinical behavior. Although postoperative radiotherapy is usually indicated in adults, it was reserved due to the immature skeleton of this boy. In this case, the use of a rigid prosthesis avoided tracheostomy and postoperative ventilation."
"Two unusual cases of infantile fibromatosis involving the mandible occurring in 2-year-old children are described. These tumours, though initially highly aggressive, underwent spontaneous regression in the absence of definitive treatment."
"A 45-year-old man without special predispositions showed a chest wall tumor with tenderness. A needle biopsy revealed a desmoid tumor which had invaded the muscles. A wide resection from the second to fifth rib was carried out and 4 years have passed without recurrence. A resection, at least 3 cm away from the lesion, is necessary for desmoid tumors which seem to have clear margins."
"Local recurrences of aggressive soft tissue tumors are frequent and very difficult to detect clinically after surgery and radiation therapy. Ultrasound is limited because the skin is thick. On contrast-enhanced CT, both scars and recurrences increase their signal. MRI is the best technique, and the only one we presently use in the detection of recurrent tumors. We are reporting 511 follow-up examinations in 182 patients after tumor removal. All patients had histologic confirmation or at least 6 months follow-up. There were 164 malignant tumors and 18 cases of aggressive fibromatosis."
"Desmoid tumors in various anatomic sites were treated in 4 females and 3 males, ranging in age from 16-50 years, during a 6-year period. In 5 the tumor was completely excised with free margins. In the other 2 excision was incomplete and the tumor recurred within a few months. Desmoid tumors have a marked tendency to local recurrence, and therefore should be widely excised. There is no evidence that adjuvant therapy has a place in the management of these tumors."
Recurrence of teratoma or carcinoma in testis cancer patients found to have teratoma at post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy is well recognized. We report a case of an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor discovered 2 years following post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy in a testis cancer patient who had teratoma at the time of lymphadenectomy. To our knowledge this is the first case of an intra-abdominal desmoid tumor discovered in this setting. The characteristics and treatment considerations of this unusual tumor are described. Desmoid tumor should be included in the differential diagnosis of tumor recurrence in testis cancer patients previously subjected to post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy.
"The proliferating cells in fibromatoses are myofibroblasts that produce abundant stromal collagen and contain intracellular native and widely spaced collagen fibers. To assess the clinical and cellular effects of colchicine in such tumors, this drug was administered to three patients, one with musculoaponeurotic desmoid fibromatosis, one with Dupuytren's palmar fibromatosis, and one with Peyronie's disease. All three patients had an excellent clinical response, with reduction of tumor size and improvement of contracture. Two cases were studied ultrastructurally; the main cellular changes detected were collapse of the rough endoplasmic reticulum cisternae, reduction of myofilaments, and disappearance of intracellular widely spaced collagen. The findings from this study indicate another probable application for colchicine and support the concept that collagen fibers can be formed intracellularly."
"Local recurrence after breast preserving treatment of breast cancer will usually be treated by simple mastectomy. Safe immediate reconstruction is only possible by use of a musculocutaneous flap, the latissimus dorsi flap or better by the rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap in it's vertical (VRAM) or transverse (TRAM) variation. As a sequel of the irradiation, one stage reconstruction with a simple submuscular implant or an expander prosthesis has a higher complication rate. Personal experience with 42 rectus flaps is reported. The rate of total necrosis was 5%, in one patient a late desmoid tumor was found in the donor area."
"Endocrine neoplasms have been reported occasionally in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). An adrenocorotical carcinoma was studied in a patient with a family history of FAP. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the region close to the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene was detected in this carcinoma, and evidence was obtained that there was a loss of the normal allele of the APC gene. This is the first demonstration of LOH at the APC locus in adrenocortical tumors. The present results and our previous data on LOH in a recurring desmoid tumor suggest that the heterozygous mutant/wild-type condition of the APC gene may give rise to benign tumors, and that functional loss of this gene leads to development of tumors not only in the colon but also in other various parts of the body in FAP patients."
Familial infiltrative fibromatosis (desmoid tumor) is a recognized complication of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) but has not been described in families without colonic polyposis. The authors describe a unique family in which a predisposition to infiltrative fibromatosis and nonpolyposis colon cancer was inherited dominantly through four generations. This report expands the range of phenotypic variation described for the hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) syndrome and adds to the extracolonic complications that are common with FAP and HNPCC.
"We present the case of a 44-year-old patient with a primary leiomyosarcoma of the right upper thigh, who developed a second mesenchymal lesion at the same thigh, diagnosed as an extra-abdominal desmoid tumor, some months after surgical treatment of his leiomyosarcoma. Clinically, histomorphologically, DNA cytometrically, immunohistochemically and radiologically the different histogenetic origin of the two lesions could be proven. The patient died 17 months after his first tumor diagnosis of lung metastases of his leiomyosarcoma."
"A case of aggressive fibromatosis (extra-abdominal desmoid) found in a 9-month-old male mixed breed cat is described. The right forearm was almost completely effaced by fibrous tissue and there were some tumours in the area from the shoulders to the mandible. These tumour-like tissues were composed of abundant collagen fibres and sparse numbers of well-differentiated fibroblasts, whereas their growing pattern was aggressive and non-encapsulated. There was dense growth of immature fibroblasts and multinucleated giant cells in some areas. Vimentin immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy suggested that the giant cells had close relation to the fibroblasts, and such areas may be the sites of cell proliferation. This case is different from nodular fasciitis and may be a proliferative disorder induced by feline oncogenic retrovirus."
"A case of desmoid tumor of the abdominal wall which was preoperatively suspected as urachal tumor is presented. The patient was a 56-year-old man, who was referred to our clinic for further examination of the mass detected incidentally in the ventral region of the urinary bladder by computed tomography. Ultrasonography showed that the mass had a heterogenous and hypoechogenic content. An urachal tumor was suspected and surgery was performed to remove the tumor. During the operation we found that the tumor was completely separated from the urinary bladder and that it had originated from the left rectus abdominal muscle. The pathological diagnosis was desmoid tumor of the abdominal wall. Since urachal tumor has no characteristic findings on the imaging examinations, it is difficult to differentiate desmoid tumor of the lower abdominal wall from urachal tumor, preoperatively."
"A case report of epithelioid adrenal angiosarcoma is presented. Tumor cells showed expression of cytokeratin, Factor VIII-related antigen, Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I, and vimentin. The patient also was found to have mesenteric fibromatosis (abdominal desmoid tumor) and an elevated serum level of estradiol. The authors discuss the unique appearance of these rare tumors, their relationship to hyperestrinism, and review the recent data in the literature showing cytokeratin expression by malignant epithelioid vascular tumors."
"This case illustrates the importance of intraoperative monitoring of neuronal function to help separate tumor tissue from neural tissue in a 54-year-old patient with left shoulder pain resulting from a desmoid tumor. Preoperative nerve conduction and electromyographic studies showed a lesion in the lateral cord of the brachial plexus, which was found to be intimately involved with the tumor mass and was splayed into a very thin effaced sheet of neural tissue. Stimulation of the tumor/nerve tissue mass proximal to the lesion was impossible due to the invasion of the brachial plexus by the tumor. The technique that was adapted for this unusual presentation was to stimulate the tumor/nerve tissue mass itself and record compound muscle action potentials distally. With the technique described, a subtotal resection of an aggressive fibromatosis enmeshed in the proximal brachial plexus was possible, and excellent relief of pain symptoms and retention of functional capabilities of the involved extremity were achieved."
"A case of extra-abdominal desmoid tumor was studied with 67Ga scintigraphy. Extra-abdominal desmoid tumors show an aggressive clinical course with tendency of recurrence in high percentage. On 67Ga scintigraphy, our case revealed a hot spot which is useful of recurrence. 67Ga scintigraphic study was useful in searching for local and recurrence after surgery."
"Desmoid tumors are rare fibroblastic proliferations that occur primarily in the abdomen and extremities. They have an estimated incidence in the United States of two to four per million inhabitants per year. A recent case of desmoid tumor prompted us to review past medical records for previous cases with the same diagnosis. Since 1985, our institution has treated five patients with a total of eight desmoid tumors. Four patients (80%) were female with ages ranging from 24 to 32 years. The other patient was a 22-year-old male with a history of Gardner's syndrome and recurrent desmoid tumors. The majority of our patients were females in the fertile age group, substantiating the hormonal effects believed to play a role in the development of these lesions. In addition, it became obvious that more investigations must be done in appropriate treatment of desmoid tumors and the documentation of these tumors in registries would be of significant benefit."
"Desmoid tumors (aggressive fibromatosis) are regarded as lesions of uncertain histopathogenesis. Cytogenetic analyses of 26 desmoid tumor specimens from abdominal or extraabdominal sites of 22 patients with or without Gardner's syndrome (GS) showed clonal karyotypic abnormalities in 7 cases, random abnormalities in 14 cases, and striking telomeric fusion in 5 cases. Loss of chromosome Y, a reported feature of fibromatosis in penile and palmar locations, was detected as a clonal aberration in two patients. Additionally, involvement of 5q was observed in six patients, two of whom had GS. Clonal interstitial deletions of 5q were observed in three patients, one with and two without GS. These findings confirm a clonal and probable neoplastic origin for desmoid tumor and suggest that abnormalities of the Y chromosome and 5q may be important in the genesis of this neoplasm."
"To compare the clinical and functional results of ileorectostomy (IR) and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), we reviewed the results of 94 IPAA patients and 21 IR patients who were operated upon between 1978 and 1988. The groups were similar with respect to age and sex. None of the patients died postoperatively. Postoperative complications occurred in 28 percent of the IPAA group and in 17 percent of the IR group (P greater than 0.1). Seven percent of IPAA patients described symptoms compatible with pouchitis. Sixty-one percent of IR patients required subsequent fulguration of rectal polyps at least once. IR patients had a mean (+/- SD) of 4 (+/- 2) stools per day, while IPAA patients had 5 (+/- 2) stools per day (P greater than 0.05). No significant difference in daytime soiling was present between IR (6 percent) and IPAA (4 percent). Nighttime spotting was also similar between the two groups. Nighttime soiling, however, was reported by 4 percent of IPAA patients but not by IR patients (P less than 0.05). One IPAA patient (1 percent) required pouch excision for a desmoid tumor, while two IR patients (11 percent) required proctectomy and ileostomy for recurrent dysplastic polyps (P less than 0.05). Adhesions and a shortened ileal mesentery prevented the construction of an ileoanal procedure in these latter patients. In conclusion, the postoperative complication rate and functional results are similar after IR and IPAA in patients with FAP; however, IR does not eradicate rectal polyps and may indeed preclude IPAA for those requiring subsequent proctectomy."

"Nine patients with mesenchymal tumors of the skull base have undergone radical tumor excision by the use of the Infratemporal fossa approach. Three cases of chondrosarcoma, two of leiomyosarcoma, and one case each of synovial sarcoma, chondroid chordoma, myxoma, and fibromatosis were managed. In the mean postoperative review time of 6.6 years (range 1.7 to 13) there are no clinical or radiologic signs of recurrence at the primary site in any patient, although two have developed distant metastases. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that, with aggressive and preferably early surgical management using this type of access to the skull base, complete removal of these tumors can be undertaken, and it is now possible to achieve permanent ablation of this type of pathologic condition at the skull base."
"Ten patients with aggressive fibromatosis of the extremities were prospectively followed for 2-6 years. Results of treatment methods were compared. Five patients underwent three-dimensional imaging with and without intravenous contrast, and the images were compared with the anatomic extent of the resected lesion. Pathologic specimens and control tissue were tested for the presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors and for expression of the c-sis oncogene and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), potent mitogens for fibrocytes. Wider surgical resection resulted in a lower recurrence rate, but current chemotherapeutic agents were not effective in eradicating the tumors. Intravenous contrast enhanced the lesions. Two thirds of the tumors tested had estrogen or progesterone receptors. All tumors tested had inappropriate expression of c-sis and PDGF. This inappropriate expression may be responsible for the underlying pathobiology and deregulation of control of growth in aggressive fibromatosis."
"The long term results of 24 patients treated with postoperative irradiation for aggressive fibromatosis are presented. Tumour sites were the pelvis (8), chest wall (5), shoulder (5), extremities (4) and head and neck (2). Macroscopic complete resection (R1) was performed in 3 cases. 17 patients presented postoperatively with gross disease (R2), 8 of which were recurrent tumours. 4 patients with inoperable disease had biopsies only. Radiation doses ranged from 28 to 64 Gy at a fractionation of 5 x 2 or 4 x 2.5 Gy/week. 4 patients had external irradiation in combination with 192Ir implants, 2 were irradiated with implants alone. In the combined treatment group, external doses ranged from 28 to 52 Gy and additional interstitial doses from 35 to 50 Gy. 192Ir treatment alone was given with 45 and 57 Gy to the contour of the target volume. The 10 year recurrence free survival rate is 75%. A dose response relationship has been established in the dose range of 30-60 Gy revealing an expected 80% persistent tumour control rate at 60 Gy. A dose volume relationship however, could not be derived from our data. Moderate fibrosis without functional impairment developed in 5 patients (21%). These data support a policy of postoperative radiotherapy with 60 Gy in patients with incompletely excised or gross residual tumour following surgery."
"Fibromatosis refers to group of benign but sometimes locally aggressive proliferative lesions of myofibroblasts. These are characterized by infiltrative growth, and hence may mimic a malignant lesion. These lesions reveal a low signal intensity on T1-weighted pulse sequences, but may show low or high signal intensity on the T2-weighted sequences. Histologic correlation reveals that the lesion showing low signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences has a larger collagenous component, and reduced cellularity compared with the lesion showing high signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences."
"To systematically assess the functional outcome of patients treated with surgery and irradiation for extremity or truncal sarcomas, and to correlate this outcome with a detailed analysis of the radiation dose distribution and surgical technique. Conservative surgery and radiation therapy (RT) are known to provide excellent local control, but the relationship of technique to functional outcome requires further study. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty-one patients were treated for lower extremity (25 patients, 61%), upper extremity (8 patients, 19.5%), and truncal (8, 19.5%) sarcomas from 1983 to 1990. Most patients had malignant fibrous histiocytoma (15), liposarcoma (8), or aggressive fibromatosis (6). Age ranged from 13 to 85 years (median 54). All patients received RT and 39 (95%) had surgery. The mean total RT dose was 59 Gy (range 55.8-64.8 Gy). A protocol for functional assessment was devised and included a 4 point scale (0-3) for each of seven functional parameters (range of motion, fibrosis, edema, pain, skin changes, muscle strength, gait, or upper extremity performance). An aggregate score was obtained by adding the seven parameter scores and compared with both a patient and physician overall functional rating score (excellent, good, fair, poor). Based on this analysis, aggregate scores were defined as < or = 3 = excellent, < or = 8 = good, < or = 13 = fair, and > 13 = poor, with 21 as the worst possible score. The same orthopaedic surgeon and radiation oncologist independently examined and rated 22 patients. An additional 17 patients were evaluated by record review. The median time from completion of radiation therapy was 30.5 months (range 7-95 months). A computerized radiation therapy dosimetric analysis was performed on 34 patients. RESULTS: Local control was achieved in 39 patients (95%), including 6 with aggressive fibromatosis. The mean functional outcome score was 5.1 with a range of 0-16. 34 patients (83%) had good or excellent functional outcomes. The rating system demonstrated minimal interobserver variability. There was a positive relationship between volume irradiated to > or = 55 Gy and functional score, strength, fibrosis, and skin changes. Total dose independent of volume was significantly associated with skin changes. Increasing peak dose (hot spot dose) was associated with fibrosis and skin changes. More fibrosis developed as the volume of the peak dose increased. A portion of the joint was treated in 5/33 extremity patients and the entire joint in 24/33 (mean dose 55.8 Gy, range 45-65 Gy). Neither range of motion nor total functional score was correlated with joint dose. Edema and functional score were not related to either the volume or percent of limb spared (receiving < or = 40 Gy). The physician functional status ratings generally concurred with patient self-assessments. CONCLUSIONS: A system for functional assessment has been developed which is easily performed and provides detailed information about patient functional outcome. This system can be used to evaluate the morbidity of combined modality sarcoma therapy. Doses up to 65 Gy, even over joint spaces, are not associated with significant morbidity. Only a small volume treated to < or = 40 Gy is required to maintain good outcome. The most important parameter appears to be the volume treated to > or = 55 Gy."
"This observation has been previously reported as a multifocal and recidivant desmoid tumor. The first time, the patient was operated on for a desmoid tumor situated on his left thigh. He was reoperated on fourteen years later for a recurrent tumor implanted on the same place and a new one on the right arm. Recently bilateral pulmonary tumors were discovered. As far as this evolution was concerned, its exceptional pattern induced a new analysis of the microscopic data and the diagnosis of fibrohistiocytic sarcoma was established. This observation suggest to the authors some comments about the difficulty of diagnosis and therapy of such soft tissue tumors."
"Gardner's syndrome ie an autosomal dominant disease characterized by the association of a polyposis coli with one or more of specific extracolonic manifestations. A lebanese family is reported. Polyposis coli, desmoid tumors, gastroduodenal polyps, procreation counselling etc. are difficult problems to manage in this syndrome."
"Forty of 416 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis were noted to have intra-abdominal desmoid tumors, and a subgroup of 16 were treated with noncytotoxic drug therapy. Drugs used were sulindac (14 patients), sulindac plus tamoxifen (3 patients), indomethacin (4 patients), tamoxifen (4 patients), progesterone (DEPO-PROVERA; Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, MI) (2 patients), and testolactone (1 patient). Therapy with these drugs for continuous periods of six months or more resulted in three complete and seven partial remissions. When treated patients were compared with untreated patients (n = 12), there were significant benefits for the treated group, both in reduction of desmoid size and in improvement of symptoms, despite the inherent selection bias against this. Sulindac was the only drug used in enough patients to permit independent evaluation of its effect, with one complete and seven partial reductions of tumor size. Some patients had a delayed response to sulindac, with tumor shrinkage occurring after an initial period of tumor enlargement. When using sulindac for the treatment of desmoid tumors, this phenomenon should be considered."

"Desmoid tumors are rare, less than 0.1% of all tumors (6.2%). The word desmoid has been recognized since 1838, and applied to non-encapsulated tumors, of connective origin and locally infiltrative. Generally, their course is painless and the recurrence rate is high if resection has not been complete. Most of these tumors can be found in different anatomic areas, most commonly the anterior abdominal wall although other sites, intra- or extra-abdominal, have been reported. We describe the case of a 50 year old female patient, with abdominal pain caused by an intraabdominal desmoid tumor."
"One hundred five consecutive patients underwent surgical resection and adjuvant irradiation in treatment of soft tissue sarcoma or aggressive fibromatosis. All patients were entered in a prospective study evaluating functional outcome and 88 patients were examined at 12 months following surgery. Outcome was characterized using the Enneking system as well as documenting employment/recreational status and limb edema. Sixty-eight of 88 patients had functional scores of 21 or better (out of a possible total of 35). Forty-four patients were serially evaluated at 12 and 24 months and there was no difference in their outcome at the 2 time points. Univariate analysis demonstrated that large tumour size, postoperative complications, and neural sacrifice were associated with poor functional outcome."
"Forty-two of 416 familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients in the FAP registry at the Cleveland Clinic had desmoid tumors. The role of cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy in the management of these patients was investigated. Eight intra-abdominal desmoid tumors were treated by systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy. Two had complete remission, and one had partial remission. Five patients died as a result of the desmoid tumor or late complications of chemotherapy. Three intra-abdominal desmoids were treated by radiation therapy with no response. Neither cytotoxic chemotherapy nor radiation therapy is recommended as a first-choice treatment for intra-abdominal desmoid tumors in patients with FAP."
"Desmoplastic fibroma is a rare primary tumor of bone that histologically and biologically mimics the extra-abdominal desmoid tumor of soft tissue. This study reviews 27 cases of desmoplastic fibroma, consisting of 9 from the Mayo Clinic files and 18 from our consultation files. There was a male predominance, and 74% of the patients were in the first 3 decades of life. The most frequent sites of involvement were the metaphysis of long bones and the mandible. Radiographically, the tumors were lucent, expansile lesions with well-defined margins. Histologically, they contained slender spindle cells and various amounts of collagen fibers. En bloc resection is the treatment of choice because a high incidence of recurrence was noticed after lesional curettage."
"We conducted a study of 90 patients with soft tissue tumor in their arms or legs, in order to determine the usefulness of scintigraphy with gallium-67 citrate as a diagnostic means. All patients had adequate scan images, and tumor tissues had been histologically confirmed by surgical resection. The subjects consisted of 19 patients with malignant tumors, 55 patients with benign tumors, and 16 patients with other disorders in which soft tissue tumor-like lesions occurred. When the activity of the tumor was more than the activity of the normal region of the contralateral extremity, it was estimated to be positive. The positive rate was found in 78% (15/19) of patients with malignant tumors, in 25% (14/55) of patients with benign tumors and in 31% (5/16) of patients with other disorders. Classified by diseases, high positive rates were observed in liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, malignant lymphoma, neurinoma, extra-abdominal desmoid and sarcoidosis. Out of 7 patients in which the activity of the tumor was equal to, or higher than that of the liver, 6 patients had malignant tumors and one patient was diagnosed as having an abscess. It seemed possible to distinguish between liposarcoma and lipoma by means of a gallium-67 scan. Furthermore, the gallium-67 scan was useful in detecting lesions of sarcoidosis as well as in evaluating the response to treatment."
"The association of skeletal anomalies and aggressive fibromatosis has been documented. Isolated bowing of the ulna is rare, yet its occurrence, particularly in conjunction with congenital dislocation of the radial head, has been documented. This article presents two cases of ulnar bowing in which the patients subsequently developed aggressive fibromatosis. We feel that aggressive fibromatosis may be a latent manifestation of congenital bowing of the ulna. The course of the disease appears to be of an aggressive nature, and patients who present with bowing of the ulna should be followed for the potential development of this disease."
"Desmoid tumors are characterized by proliferation of fibroblastic cells that arise from the fascia or aponeurosis of muscle. They are most commonly found in the abdomen of adults, arising from the anterior abdominal wall, mesentery, or retroperitoneum. At sonography, desmoids have variable echogenicity, with smooth, well-defined margins. On contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scans, the tumors are generally high attenuation (relative to muscle) and have either ill- or well-defined margins. At magnetic resonance imaging, desmoids have low signal intensity relative to muscle on T1-weighted images and variable signal intensity on T2-weighted images. There are no specific imaging features to distinguish desmoid tumors from other solid masses. The diagnosis of desmoid tumor should be considered in patients with an abdominal mass, a history of abdominal surgery or injury, or Gardner syndrome."
"Congenital fibromatosis is a rare and benign myofibroblastic tumor that may occur in either a solitary or multicentric form. The soft-tissue form of this entity is well recognized. This report analyzes the clinical and pathologic features of 14 cases of congenital fibromatosis in which the tumor existed as a solitary lesion in bone. Most of the tumors (71%) were in patients who were 2 years old or younger. All but one tumor involved the craniofacial bones. Radiographically, they were purely lucent lesions in which a sclerotic rim was visible in each skull lesion. The myofibroblastic appearance closely resembled the microscopic features seen in the soft-tissue counterpart. For appropriate surgical management, it is imperative to recognize that this tumor occurs as a solitary lesion in bone and that it is distinct from other, more aggressive fibrous lesions."
"mild fibromatosis, aggressive fibromatosis, and fibrosarcoma. The latter two stages are highly vascularized when compared with both the normal dermis and the initial mild lesion. Analysis of cell cultures derived from biopsies of these lesions has revealed that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is synthesized in all three stages and in normal dermal fibroblasts derived from the same mice. Unexpectedly, there is a change in the localization of bFGF from its normal cell-associated state to extracellular release in the latter two stages, which is concomitant both with the neovascularization seen in vivo and with the tumorigenicity of these cell lines. Thus, in this multistep tumorigenesis pathway there appears to be a discrete switch to the angiogenic phenotype that correlates with the export of bFGF, a known angiogenic factor."
"Two female patients with desmoid tumors (aggressive fibromatosis) showed tumor regression after endocrine therapy. In one patient, tumor response to tamoxifen has been maintained over several years of treatment. In the second patient, who had inoperable mesenteric fibromatosis, the tumor progressed on tamoxifen but regressed after treatment with Zoladex (goserelin acetate, ICI, Melbourne, Australia) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). To the authors' knowledge this is the first report of the use of Zoladex in the treatment of desmoid tumors. This review of the literature reveals that the biology of this disease is related to the endogenous hormonal environment and that estrogen receptors have been documented in desmoid tumors. Thirty-five cases are identified where endocrine agents have been employed, with a response rate of 51%. Furthermore, tumors may respond to second-line hormonal therapy after failing to respond to initial endocrine treatment. Endocrine treatments have also been used in other disorders of fibroblastic origin. The authors recommend that endocrine treatment be employed in inoperable desmoid tumors or where there has been postsurgical recurrence. In addition, the role for endocrine therapy in other soft tissue neoplasms should be determined."
"Desmoid tumors are rare, but not in patients with Gardner's syndrome. Although standard treatment is wide surgical excision, we prescribed chemotherapy for a 30-year-old woman with intra-abdominal desmoids, a complication after subtotal colectomy for the treatment of familial polyposis coli. Exploratory laparotomy revealed that the desmoids were not resectable. Chemotherapy with combinations of vincristine, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone was prescribed for over 3 months, and a partial regression of the tumors occurred. Two years after the initiation of the chemotherapy, complete regression of tumors was achieved with cyclophosphamide and prednisone. Surgical excision, irradiation, and chemotherapy treatments are discussed."
"Two murine monoclonal antibodies, 29-13 (IgG1) and 29-2 (IgG2a), generated against malignant fibrous histiocytoma plasma membranes immunoprecipitated a Mr 200,000 protein (p200), with an isoelectric point between 6.3 and 7.5. Two additional antibodies, 35-16 (IgG1) and 30-40 (IgG2a), generated against Ewing's sarcoma membranes, immunoprecipitated an acidic protein of Mr 160,000 (p160), with an isoelectric point between 5.8 and 6.7. Monoclonal antibodies 29-13 and 29-2 recognize a similar determinant(s) on p200 while 35-16 and 30-40 recognize different determinants on p160. Monoclonal antibody 29-13 exhibited significant binding to membranes isolated from fibrosarcoma and aggressive fibromatosis; moderate binding to osteosarcoma, hemangiopericytoma, and malignant fibrous histiocytoma; and minimal to no binding to other soft tissue sarcoma plasma membranes. The p200 protein was not expressed in 16 other malignant tumors and in only 3 of 35 normal human tissue specimens. High levels of p200 were selectively expressed by leiomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and fibrosarcoma cells as well as neonatal fibroblasts in vitro, but not by other carcinoma cell lines or B-lymphoblasts. The p160 protein appeared to be selectively expressed by Ewing's sarcoma with little or no expression on other sarcomas, carcinomas, or normal tissues. However, the p160 antigen was expressed in Ewing's sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, melanoma, 4 of 9 carcinomas, and neonatal fibroblasts in vitro. The affinity of MoAbs 29-13, 29-2, 35-16, and 30-40 ranged from 5.3 x 10(8) to 4.7 x 10(9) M-1 for sarcoma membranes with approximately 5 x 10(4) binding sites/sarcoma cell."
". The most frequent topographic site was the extremities (48, 44%), followed by the trunk (31, 29%) and the head and neck region (27, 25%). Virtually 50% (51 tumors) of cases were diagnosed during the first year of life, and 73 (71%) occurred in the first decade. The known recurrence rate was 16% (17 cases). Fibromatosis of various subtypes accounted for 95% of the histologically benign group. Infantile myofibromatosis was the most frequent form of fibromatosis, followed by aggressive (desmoid) fibromatosis (20 cases, 19%). Ninety percent of infantile myofibromatoses were diagnosed in the first year of life. In contrast, 70% of aggressive fibromatoses occurred in the second decade. Associated conditions included familial desmoid fibromatosis, Gardner syndrome, and previous surgery. The borderline category was represented by the 14 (13% of the series) congenital-infantile fibrosarcomas. All of the 14 (13%) malignant tumors were classic adult-type fibrosarcomas that occurred only in later childhood and adolescence. Fibromatosis colli, fibrous hamartoma of infancy, juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, Dupuytren-type fibromatosis, infantile digital fibromatosis, juvenile aponeurotic fibroma, unclassified fibromatoses, and fibroma of tendon or nerve sheath constituted the remaining cases."
"AF is a non-encapsulated, non-metastasizing fibrous tumor that has a tendency for local recurrence in up to 70% of cases. We suspect possible genetic disposition. Microscopically, AF is a poorly circumscribed fibrous tumor that infiltrates surrounding tissues. It presents as a painless, rapidly growing mass with a predilection for bone destruction. Treatment consists of a carefully planned en bloc resection after biopsy and accurate radiologic evaluation of the extent of the tumor. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy can be used as adjuvant therapy in selected patients. Three patients with AF of the head and neck are described, of which two were found to have congenital disorders of mesodermal development."
"Desmoid tumours (extraabdominal desmoids, aggressive fibromatosis) are rare connective tissue tumours, that grow infiltratively and destructively. The analysis of the course of disease in three patients suffering from desmoid tumours in the head and neck region (regio submandibularis, regio parotidea, parapharyngeal space) confirmed the data in literature that painless swelling and dysfunction are the first non-specific signs of the disease. Morphologically reactive fibromatosis and fibrosarcoma should be considered (amongst others) in differential diagnosis. CT and MR scans are useful in determining the extent of the tumours and help to distinguish the tumour from nerves, vessels and bone. Surgery is the therapy of choice in the head and neck region. Primary surgery was performed in our patients. Due to recurrences two of our patients have been operated on several times including major plastic reconstructive surgery. One patient died three and a half years after primary treatment due to sarcomatous degeneration. A large parapharyngeal recurrence was successfully reduced by percutaneous radiation therapy in our second patient. Follow-up of our third patient was NAD 15 months after resection of a large parapharyngeal/mediastinal process including blocking of two cervical vertebrae. Summing up, desmoid tumours are rare connective tissue tumours in the head and neck region with a destructive biological behaviour similar to malignant tumours and a high recurrence rate. Surgery is the treatment of choice. In recurrences or if the tumour is not properly resectable, radiation must be considered, whereas the chemotherapeutical approach is not yet well established."
"Fibromatoses are uncommon infiltrative lesions affecting musculoaponeurotic structures, most often of the limbs and trunk. Lesions involving the cranial cavity are rare and require the same aggressive surgical management as elsewhere in the body. This case illustrates their clinical and neuroradiological features and underscores the necessity for aggressive resection to avoid recurrence. The literature is reviewed."
"Twenty-nine patients (thirty sites) who had histologically confirmed aggressive fibromatosis were treated with radical courses of radiation at the University of Florida between March 1975 and February 1986. The minimum length of follow-up was two years; 76 per cent of the patients were followed for more than five years. Twenty-seven sites received doses of at least 5000 centigrays (one centigray equals one rad). Twelve patients were treated twice a day. Fourteen sites were treated with radiation postoperatively for known or presumed microscopic quantities of residual aggressive fibromatosis; in eleven, the disease was locally controlled. Sixteen sites were treated postoperatively for known grossly apparent residual disease; in fourteen, the disease was locally controlled. Over-all, aggressive fibromatosis was controlled in twenty-five (83 per cent) of the thirty sites. The six-year actuarial rate of local control was 79 per cent. The five local recurrences occurred at four, eleven, thirty-four, sixty-one, and sixty-eight months after the initiation of radiation therapy. Two of the five failures occurred in the high-dose radiation field in patients who were treated for grossly apparent disease. The remaining three failures occurred at the margin of the irradiated field in patients who were treated for assumed microscopic quantities of residual disease. There was no apparent difference in local control between patients who were treated for primary (previously untreated) aggressive fibromatosis and those who were treated after one or more recurrences. Comparison of the results of radiation therapy with published data on operative treatment shows that local control substantially improves with postoperative radiation therapy when operative margins are less than wide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Pyruvate kinase (PK) was studied in 57 fibroblastic and fibrohistiocytic proliferations and normal fibrous tissue (n = 10). The specific activity was significantly increased in malignant tumors (1.67 +/- 0.25) compared with normal tissue (0.26 +/- 0.04; P less than 0.001) and benign proliferations (0.52 +/- 0.05; P less than 0.005). Although an overlap exists between aggressive fibromatosis and the benign group, high values of PK activity are indicative of Grade 2 and 3 malignancy. Significant shifts in isozyme pattern, favoring the expression of K-type subunits were found in tumors with a metastasizing potential and aggressive fibromatosis. These changes in the isozyme pattern of PK in aggressive fibromatosis may act as another argument to place them in the category of malignant fibroblastic tumors."
"Primary soft tissue sarcomas of the chest wall are uncommon, and data concerning treatment and results are sparse. Most studies have categorized these tumors as truncal sarcomas and inferred a poor prognosis. To assess the results of surgical treatment, we reviewed our 40-year experience. METHODS: Records of 189 patients admitted to our institution from 1948 to 1988 were reviewed. Pathologic material was available for review in the 149 cases (79%) that comprise this report. Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, with comparisons by log-rank analysis and significance defined as p less than 0.05. RESULTS: Ages ranged from 3 weeks to 86 years (median, 38 years); the ratio of male to female patients was 2:1. The initial complaint was mass or pain in 97% of the cases. Ninety sarcomas (60%) were high grade and 59 (40%) were low grade. Histologic types were as follows: desmoid tumor (n = 32, 21%); liposarcoma (n = 23, 15%); rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 18, 12%); fibrosarcoma (n = 17, 11%); embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 14, 9%); malignant peripheral nerve tumor (n = 13, 9%); malignant fibrous histiocytoma (n = 11, 7%); spindle cell sarcoma (n = 4, 3%); tenosynovial sarcoma (n = 3, 3%); hemangiopericytoma (n = 3, 3%); alveolar soft part sarcoma (n = 3, 3%); and other types (n = 12, 9%). Resection was the primary treatment in 140 cases (94%). Local recurrence developed in 27%. Metastases occurred in 52 (35%) of the cases (metachronous in 42, synchronous in 10) and were more common in patients with high-grade disease (46/90, 51%) than in those with low-grade disease (6/59, 10%). Overall 5-year survival was 66%. Five-year survival rate for those with high-grade sarcomas (49%) was significantly lower than that for low-grade sarcomas (90%, p less than 0.0001). Tumor size and age of patient were not prognostic. CONCLUSIONS: Survival of patients with primary soft tissue sarcomas of the chest wall after resection is similar to that of patients with sarcomas of the extremities. Resection alone provides acceptable survival (90% at 5 years) for those with low-grade sarcomas, but adjuvant treatment should be considered for those with high-grade sarcomas."
"The desmoid tumor is a rare neoplasm which, because of its histopathologic appearance, has been traditionally considered to be benign. Despite its benign microscopic features, it has an aggressive local behavior and, if not excised adequately, has a tendency to recur locally and invade neighboring structures with significant potential for morbidity, deformity, or even death. Two cases of recurrent extraabdominal desmoid tumors are presented not only because they are highly representative of this disease, but also because they emphasize the need for aggressive surgical treatment. Also, they are unusual and challenging cases from a reconstructive standpoint. Based on this experience and on the most recent literature, we believe that this tumor, regardless of its microscopic features, should be addressed and treated as a malignancy."
"Ten patients with large inoperable desmoid tumors in various body locations were treated with testolactone. Four tumors (40%) responded with major regressions, i.e., more than 50% reduction in volume. Eight patients received nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (indomethacin, sulindac, or sulindac with warfarin and vitamin K1 [Mephyton]) for periods of 2 to 91 months. There was one major regression, one partial regression, and three instances of tumor growth arrest over periods up to 8 years. Seven patients were treated with nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs concurrent with or after testolactone or tamoxifen. There were five major regressions and one partial regression with extensive central necrosis of an enormous intra-abdominal tumor. The last patient has been treated for only 12 months, with no change in tumor volume. It appears that estrogens function as growth factors for desmoid tumors, and that minimization of these effects inhibits tumor growth in some, but not all, cases. In those instances where antiestrogens were not effective as single agents, the tumors usually responded to subsequent nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug therapy. Withdrawal of estrogen may be followed by inhibition of transcription of genes that support tumor cell proliferation, and sulindac and indomethacin may augment these effects by inhibiting prostaglandin and cyclic AMP synthesis and the activity of protein kinase C. Warfarin may function as a protonophore to acidify the cytoplasm and prevent the alkalinization that is necessary to initiate DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression, again an impairment of the transcription process."
"Although retroperitoneal fibrosis is uncommon and histologically benign, it is a progressive and potentially fatal tumor. As the fibroblasts proliferate, they encase and may obstruct important retroperitoneal structures. Medical therapy in the past has been ineffectual, and since the tumor usually cannot be resected, surgery consists of lysis or bypass of the involved structures. Tamoxifen is effective in the treatment of desmoid tumors, and we report its use in two patients with retroperitoneal fibrosis with excellent results. The simplicity and safety of this treatment make tamoxifen an attractive choice of therapy."
"Aggressive juvenile fibromatosis is a destructive, locally invasive process, with a propensity for local recurrence after inadequate excision. Although it does not metastasize, uncontrolled growth can eventually lead to death. The role for radiation and chemotherapy is controversial and these modalities are best reserved for advanced unresectable or recurrent lesions. The treatment of choice is en bloc surgical resection with wide margins."
"A case of recurrent retroperitoneal desmoid tumor successfully treated with tamoxifen (Nolvadex tablets, ICI Pharma, Division of ICI Americas, Wilmington, DE) is reported. The patient presented late in her second pregnancy with a large retroperitoneal pelvic desmoid tumor that was treated with surgical excision and megestrol acetate. When the tumor recurred 12 months later, it was again treated with surgery, this time followed by radiation therapy. The desmoid tumor quickly recurred. The patient was then treated with tamoxifen, resulting in a complete tumor regression that has remained stable for 27 months. Tamoxifen should be considered as first-line therapy in recurrent desmoid tumors."

"Two disorders involving histologically benign proliferations of fibrous tissue or of histiocytes occur preferentially in children and often require combined management by an orthopedic surgeon and a pediatric oncologist. Treatment of young people with aggressive fibromatosis usually begins with wide local excision of the lesion. However, some tumors cannot be completely removed either because of their location or because of the risk of subsequent serious dysfunction. Not infrequently, local recurrence supervenes despite previous wide local excision, and sometimes multiple tumors are present. In these situations a trial of multiple-agent chemotherapy incorporating vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide may be indicated in an attempt to control the disease. Radiation therapy may also be useful, but the relatively high dose (5000 cGy or more) needed in a growing child is at times a less attractive alternative. Biopsy of a lytic bone lesion in young patients with Langerhans' cell histiocytosis, formerly known as histiocytosis X, is also indicated for initial diagnosis. Biopsy and curettage are usually curative in the patient with an isolated lesion. Patients with multiple simultaneous or recurrent lesions need chemotherapy if dysfunction of the liver, spleen, or lungs is present. Drug therapy may also be beneficial for children with systemic symptoms. This article outlines suggestions for chemotherapeutic treatment in both diseases."
"Fibromatosis is an aggressive, infiltrating, non-metastasizing disease characterized by a benign neoplastic histology. These lesions tend to infiltrate the soft tissues and adjacent bony tissues, hence the term ""aggressive infantile fibromatosis"". Two cases of this rare pathology are presented and discussed."
"four of abdominal localization, six in extremities, five in the maxillo-facial mass, one in the torax and one in the lumbo-sacral region. Histological diagnosis, either by puncture or biopsy, is complemented by studies of extension of the tumour based on ecography and TAC. All cases were treated according to the classical criteria of ample resection of the lesion, always when practicable, except in one infant case and in the torax, in which only a biopsy was effected. Of the 15 cases resected, nine cases had local relapses, six of which remained free of disease with a second operation, another two required a third operation and the remaining case needed five interventions. In six children chemotherapy was applied with vincristina, cyclophosphamide and adriamicina. A follow up was carried out in 14 patients, one of which died and the remaining 13 are free of disease. In spite of the fact that progestagene receptors were not evidenced in two of our cases, one presented complete remission of the tumor after treatment with medroxyprogesterone. In this case the coincidence of Gardner's syndrome arises in the family history.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"Between 1965 and 1989, 46 desmoid tumors were observed in the hospitals of Lyon. Twenty-eight patients with an extra-abdominal tumor, with a follow-up of at least 6 months were observed. In this group, there were 12 males and 16 females with an average of 26.7 years. Surgical treatment was performed in 26 cases (in one case no treatment was given and in another case isolated chemotherapy was given). In 21 cases (80%) a recurrence of the tumor was seen after the first excision, incomplete in 6 cases. The highest rate of recurrence was seen in the neck, the girdles and the lower limbs; at the end of our review, 9 patients still had a tumor. No primary amputation were performed but two late amputations, one of which was major, were necessary. One tumor evolved into a sarcoma and in another case, lung metastases were seen. Associated radiotherapy was given in 9 cases with resolution in 55%. Tamoxifen was used in 5 cases with stabilization of the tumor. The risk of recurrence was higher in males (p = 0.0147). Age less than 30 years, and incomplete removal of the tumor were the other predictive factors for recurrence (the difference was not significant)."
"The authors report a case of patient with a complete Gardner's syndrome. This case is characterized by the association of desmoid tumor of the thoraco-abdominal wall, mesenteric fibromatosis, gastric and duodenal polyposis and a rectal adenocarcinoma. They present a brief review of the syndrome which raises problems of clinical classification and therapeutic difficulties."
"A case of intra-abdominal desmoid tumors in familial polyposis coli (FPC), which regressed and disappeared by prednisolone treatment, is reported. A 37-year-old Japanese man with abdominal lumps was admitted to our hospital. He had had proctocolectomy two years before because of FPC with rectal cancer. At laparotomy, tumors were present in the abdominal wall, mesentery, and retroperitoneum. Only a small part of the tumors was resected and diagnosed microscopically to be desmoid tumors. With prednisolone administration (20 to 5 mg/day) subjective symptoms were ameliorated and desmoid tumors slowly regressed. Bilateral hydronephrosis continued and resulted in ""retroperitoneal fibrosis."" To our knowledge, this case is the first well-documented case of retroperitoneal fibrosis in a patient with FPC. The characteristics of the desmoid tumor in familial polyposis coli or in Gardner's syndrome and the methods for its management are discussed."
"Desmoid tumors are rare lesions with a local invasive potential and a risk of recurrence considered as benign due to the absence of metastases. They are included in fibromatoses and may be associated with Gardner's syndrome. The authors report an unusual case, in a 26 year old man, of a desmoid tumor invading ileon, right colon, appendix and the right ureter and responsible of a ureteral obstruction. Etiologic factors (traumatic, hormonal, auto-immune, ... ) are discussed. The treatment of choice to lower the risk of recurrence is the complete surgical removal of the tumor."
"A desmoid tumor was found in a patient with Gardner's syndrome. The tumor was visualized by CT before and after contrast injection, by radiographic examination of the small bowel, and by sonography. CT demonstrated a heterogeneous mass in the left lower abdomen with attenuation values ranging from 23 to 72 HU on native scans, enhancing to 123 up to 172 HU after injection of contrast medium. This examination also demonstrated the extent of the tumor and its exact dimensions. The radiographic examination of the small bowel completed the diagnosis and showed no involvement of the small bowel. This diagnosis was confirmed by laparotomy."
"Desmoid tumor of the mandible, or desmoplastic fibroma, is a rare disease with only a few cases reported in the literature. This paper presents the rare case of an elderly male with desmoplastic fibroma of the mandible with an uncommon accompanying proliferative myositis. The case is discussed with emphasis on the clinical presentation, differential diagnosis and treatment of this lesion."
"The authors report a case of desmoid fibroma on the posterior surface of the thigh in a woman during the post-partum period. This is a rare site for this tumour. CT scan combined with MRI appears to be useful for diagnosis. Treatment is strictly surgical, but depends on the histological benign nature and the local malignancy. Surgery is generally conservative with risks of recurrence and occasionally amputation is necessary."
"A recently developed rf echo planar imaging method has been modified to rapidly generate spectroscopic information along one in-plane axis and spatial information along the other. The method allows the production of one-dimensional chemical shift images (1D CSIs) in acquisition times of 18 sec or less. A specific phase-encode-reordering algorithm provides convenient manipulation of T2 weighting, yielding partial suppression of short T2 species like muscle water. The method is demonstrated in phantoms and in vivo with 1D CSIs of human brain and limbs. Abnormal fat distribution is demonstrated in the calf of a patient with aggressive fibromatosis. The advantages of short acquisition times obtainable with SIRFEN are offset by limited spectral resolution, suggesting that primary applications will be confined to rapid spatial mapping of major spectral components."
"Desmoid was diagnosed in 54 out of 632 patients who had been operated on for diffuse polyposis. The age of patients with desmoid ranged from 18-61 years. Twenty of them had desmoid in the anterior abdominal wall whereas 30--in the small intestine mesentery or retroperitoneal space. Dissection was carried out in 14 out of 18 patients with anterior abdominal wall desmoid. Recurrence was registered in 6 patients. Dissection was attempted in 12 out of 26 patients with intraabdominal desmoid but radical procedure could be performed in 5 only. In a group of 4 patients with synchronous desmoid of both sites, both tumors were removed in one patient only whereas in the other 3--only anterior abdominal wall tumor could be dissected."
"Twenty-five patients with adenomatosis coli were subjected to operations, and two in which desmoid tumors appeared after the operation on familial adenomatosis coli are described here. These patients were 26 and 37 year-old males. After the total colorectomy, each tumor was associated with soreness and was palpated in the lower abdominal wall, and operations were performed. The histological findings from the resected specimens, 12 cm and 34 cm in size, indicated desmoid tumors. Poliposis of the large intestine with desmoid tumors, as a complication, has been reported in 23 previous cases in Japan."
"The frequency of a fibrosarcoma, based on current criteria, is less than 10% of soft tissue sarcomas. It is most common in the region of extremities and the trunk and relatively rare in the head and neck region. Therefore, of interest is a case of a well differentiated fibrosarcoma arising in left neck region of a 69-year-old woman that is reported. The excised tumor consisted of a firm, partially lobulated mass with a fibrous capsule that measured 8 cm at its greatest diameter. Histologically, the tumor tissue was rather uniform and often had a fasciculated growth pattern consisting of spindle shaped cells and interwoven collagenous fiber in a parallel fashion. To achieve a diagnosis, it was necessary to differentiate this type of fibrosarcoma from aggressive fibromatosis and myogenic tumor (leiomyoma or leiomyosarcoma)."
"A case of aggressive abdominal fibromatosis is reported. Ultrasonography revealed multiple inhomogenous, hypoechoic tumours within the mesenterium and the anterior abdominal wall. Some of these lesions had a hyperechogenic margin."
"Nine cases of malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFH) were examined immunohistochemically in frozen sections with six different monoclonal antibodies to histiomonocytic and related cells (EBM11, HAM-56, KB90, antibodies to dendritic reticulum cells, HLADR and LCA). Ten other soft tissue sarcomas, two desmoid tumors, twelve carcinomas, three seminomas and four lymphomas were studied for comparison. All cases of MFH showed positivity for histiomonocytic cell antigens. In six cases, the positive cells could be clearly interpreted to be infiltrating non-neoplastic cells. However, immunoreactivity for multiple histiocytic markers (EBM11, HAM-56, KB90, HLADR) was seen in tumor cells in three cases of MFH. In one of these cases, the positivity could be verified with KP1, an antibody to histiomonocytic cells applied in formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue. None of the tumors was positive with the antibody to dendritic reticulum cells or LCA. In the series of non-histiocytic tumors, no cases showed widespread positivity for multiple histiocytic markers. Our results suggest that in relation to true histiomonocytic differentiation MFH might be a heterogeneous group of tumors. The widespread immunoreactivity for multiple histiocytic markers in some cases may indicate a true histiomonocytic differentiation in some MFHs."
"A 30 year old woman with aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid) of the left upper arm and scapular region was treated with wide excision. Two years later she presented with extensive local recurrence of the scapular and deltoid regions. She was treated with tamoxifen (20 mg daily) and, over the next 6 months, the tumour regressed. She has been recurrence-free for the past year. We suggest that, in patients with desmoid tumours, hormone receptor determination and hormone therapy be attempted before subjecting patients to any form of radical treatment with surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy."
"We reviewed MR imaging findings in 14 patients with primary soft-tissue tumors of the foot and compared them with surgical and pathologic findings to determine the value of MR imaging in anatomic localization, delineation, and characterization of such lesions. Nine tumors (64%) were benign, and five (36%) were malignant. The anatomic location (compartment, space, relation to specific tendon) and extent of all tumors were accurately shown by MR imaging. Twelve tumors (86%) were correctly characterized as benign or malignant. Eight (89%) of nine benign lesions showed distinctive MR imaging features that correctly suggested a specific diagnosis. These included hemangioma (high T2-weighted intensity and internal septa), ganglion cyst (homogeneous, high T2-weighted weighted intensity and peritendinous location), plantar fibromatosis (nodularity of plantar aponeurosis with low intensity on all sequences), and pigmented villonodular synovitis (low T2-weighted intensity and lower intensity rim). Aggressive fibromatosis (one case) could not be characterized. Four (80%) of five malignant neoplasms had MR imaging findings suggesting soft-tissue sarcoma. Two synovial sarcomas were inhomogeneous and showed extensive peritendinous growth. Two clear cell sarcomas arose at the origin of the plantar aponeurosis and infiltrated adjacent muscle. A small clear cell sarcoma could not be characterized as benign or malignant. MR imaging of the foot is accurate in showing the extent of soft-tissue tumors, which is helpful for surgical planning. Determination of their specific anatomic location may help characterize some tumors. Although our series is small, it appears that MR imaging often suggests a specific diagnosis in certain benign soft-tissue tumors of the foot and may often correctly distinguish benign from malignant tumors."
"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), which includes familial polyposis coli (FPC) and the Gardner syndrome (GS), is a genetically determined premalignant disease of the colon inherited by a locus (APC) mapping within 5q15-q22. To elucidate the role of 5q loss in FAP tumorigenesis, we analysed 51 colorectal tumors and seven desmoids from 19 cases of FPC and five GS patients, as well as 15 sporadic colon cancers. RFLP analysis revealed a high incidence of allelic deletion in hereditary colon cancers as well as in sporadic colon cancers with a peak at the APC locus. APC loss resulted primarily from interstitial deletion or mitotic recombination. Combined tumor and pedigree analysis in a GS family revealed loss of normal 5q alleles in three tumors, including a desmoid tumor, which suggests the involvement of hemizygosity or homozygosity of the defective APC gene in colon carcinogenesis and, possibly, in extracolonic neoplasms associated with FAP."
"Despite its benign microscopic appearance, aggressive fibromatosis has potential to recur and infiltrate neighboring tissues. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the exact extent before therapy. In the present study, 11 cases of aggressive fibromatosis were examined scintigraphically using [99mTc(V)]dimercaptosuccinic acid (11 cases) and 67Ga-citrate (7 cases). Technetium-99m-(V)-dimercaptosuccinic acid demonstrated all lesions, while 67Ga-citrate detected 57% of the cases."
An 18-year-old girl presented with severe chest pain and shortness of breath. She was found to have a large desmoid tumor filling the right chest cavity. The etiology of the desmoid tumor is unknown but is thought to be associated with an underlying genetic defect and local trauma. These tumors may be estrogen sensitive and are more frequent in females of reproductive age. The case demonstrates the difficulty in treating these tumors effectively.
The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of aggressive fibromatosis in 11 patients (five with recurrent tumour) and its contribution to patient management are described. Tumour signal intensity ranged from being low to isointense with respect to muscle on T1-weighted images while being predominantly of heterogenous increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images. A post-contrast (Gd-DTPA) study demonstrating diffuse tumour enhancement was of value in assessing tumour extent in two patients. CT in six patients and angiography in two patients provided no additional information while tumour relationship to neurovascular structures and extent was better appreciated on MRI. MRI was accurate in predicting resectability in all six patients who had surgery.
"7 are alive without evidence of disease (mean, 72 months) and 1 died of lung carcinoma at 108 months. The 2 patients with Gardner's syndrome have persistent fibromatosis: 1 patient had recurrence in the abdominal wall at 103 months and 1 is alive at 72 months with intra-abdominal masses. We conclude that mesenteric fibromatosis is much more aggressive in patients with Gardner's syndrome than in patients without Gardner's syndrome, that pathologic features are not good predictors of aggressive behavior, and that complete surgical excision may not always be necessary."
"A desmoid tumor is a rare neoplasm of soft tissues and, although benign, is locally invasive and tends to recur. We report a case of suspected recurrence of a supraclavicular desmoid tumor that had been resected 2 years earlier. Computed tomography suggested the correct diagnosis of a pseudoaneurysm of a venous graft that had been placed during the resection."
"metastatic colorectal carcinoma, 64 patients (58.2 percent), (colon, 49 [44.5 percent], rectal, 15 [13.6 percent]); desmoid tumors, 12 (10.9 percent); periampullary carcinoma, 9 (8.2 percent); brain tumors, 8 (7.3 percent); perioperative mortalities, 5 (4.5 percent); adrenal carcinoma, 1 (0.9 percent); and abdominal carcinomatosis, 1 (0.9 percent). Ten patients died of causes not related to FAP. The major causes of death in 36 patients who underwent prophylactic colectomy were desmoid tumor and periampullary malignancy. This finding underscores the importance of lifelong surveillance and periodic endoscopic evaluation in patients with FAP."
"Extra-abdominal fibromatosis in the neck may occasionally cause serious sequelae when aggressive invasion of the vital structures occurs. However, the principle of wide excision is difficult to apply in some patients because of the important organs surrounding the tumor. We report herein, a woman followed up for 22 years, in whom testolactone showed a definite effect during the course of observation. She first presented, at the age of 52, with a painful tumor in the neck, located behind the right thyroid lobe and fixed to the adjacent structures. Incomplete excision of the tumor was followed by a local recurrence accompanied with recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy and Horner's syndrome on the right side. Prednisolone was administered for 2 1/2 months and external irradiation of 8,000 RAD was given. Enlargement of the recurrent tumor stopped but 2 months later an emergency tracheostomy was required for an airway obstruction. Over the next 3 years, the local findings remained unchanged, but then a painful tumor growth reappeared cephalad which gradually attained a size of 5 cm in diameter, and was fixed to the base. Testolactone 150 to 200 mg was given to the patient daily for 2 months, resulting in marked regression of the tumor. During the last 13 years the patient has been well with the tumor still decreasing in size."
"From 1964 through 1984, 45 patients were referred for radiation therapy for desmoid tumor. Fourteen patients had inoperable lesions, or gross residual disease after incomplete resection. Thirty-one patients received postoperative XRT for positive margins or concern about the adequacy of the margin. The minimum follow-up was 2 years, maximum 22 years, median 7.6 years. No patient was lost to follow-up. The primary site was head and neck in 5, upper extremity in 10, chest wall and back in 8, abdomen 2, pelvis 4, and lower extremity 16. All patients were treated with megavoltage radiation therapy using shrinking field techniques. Large fields received a median dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions. Boost fields were used in the majority of patients to deliver an additional dose of 7 to 27 Gy. The range of total doses was 50 to 76.2 Gy. Three patients received a boost with neutrons. Analysis of patients with inoperable or gross residual showed tumor control in 10 of 14 with a median follow-up of 9.4 years. Resolution of gross disease occurred at a range of 1/2 to 64.3 months with a median of 9 months. There was no evidence of a higher probability of ultimate control at higher doses. Tumor control was equal for men and women. The ten patients with local control had doses from 50 to 76.2 Gy whereas the four patients with in field failures had tumor doses of 57 to 66.4 Gy. There was no difference in median dose for patients with local control (60.3 Gy) versus those with tumor recurrence (60 Gy). For subclinical disease, 31 patients receiving postoperative or preoperative XRT had a 77 percent probability of local control in spite of the history of multiple tumor recurrences; local control was achieved in 8 of 9 with negative or uncertain margins and 16 of 22 with positive margins. An analysis of local control as a function of the number of operations revealed that patients referred for adjuvant radiotherapy with no more than two operative procedures had an 88 percent probability of local control, versus 66 percent for more than two operative procedures. All grade 3 complications (defined as requiring surgical intervention or prolonged hospitalization) occurred with doses above 60 Gy. Management of recurrences was successful in 8 of the 11 patients and no patient has died of tumor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
"A 22 years old Melanesian patient had a tumor in the anterior and external side of the left leg. Three times, this tumor had a surgical treatment, by resection, then an amputation of the leg. Always, its histological aspect was agreeing with a desmoid fibroma. After an evolution of 23 months time, metastases appeared in the lungs. Most of the authors don't agree the existence of metastases in these tumors. Four observations were reported in the literature, including one in 1989. They emphasize the difficulties of the histological diagnosis of these tumors. The metastases seems to be an argument in the evolution, which incites to modify the initial diagnosis as a fibrosarcoma in spite of the lack of obvious histological malignancy."
"Congenital fibromatosis is a rare form of fibroblastic proliferation, which may appear similar to fibrosarcoma; it is multicentric, involving soft tissues, viscera, and bones. The larger soft tissue tumors are very hemorrhagic and necrotic, and they may contain calcifications. Because these characteristics are also present in the more common hemangiomas of infancy, congenital fibromatosis can be diagnosed erroneously as hemangioma. We report a case of congenital generalized fibromatosis erroneously diagnosed initially as hemangioma. The multicentric tumor was aggressive, ultimately resulting in death."
"a 35-year-old man without polyposis coli who developed a clavicular posttraumatic desmoid tumour, and a 52-year-old woman with polyposis coli who died of an intra-abdominal desmoid tumour 3 years after prophylactic colectomy. A close follow-up of patients with Gardner's syndrome for early detection of desmoid tumours after surgery is recommended."
"Exposure of fibroblasts derived from keloid tissues, desmoid and dermal tissue from individuals with Gardner's syndrome (GS) to dexamethasone resulted in the suppression of protein kinase C (PKC) activity and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA, and a 20-fold induction of glutamine synthetase activity. Treatment of GS and keloid fibroblasts with 0.1 microM dexamethasone for 36 h increased glucocorticoid receptor (GR) synthesis, as determined by [35S]methionine labeling and immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody to the human GR. The suppression of PKC activity by dexamethasone was shown to result from a loss of protein mass as determined by immunoblotting using an antibody to PKC type III. In contrast to these results, exposure of fibroblasts isolated from normal tissues to dexamethasone did not result in the suppression PKC and [3H]thymidine incorporation, there was only a sixfold induction of glutamine synthetase, and a decrease of GR synthesis. As no primary receptor binding defect could be detected, the altered response of tumor cells to steroid-occupied receptor indicates a partial post-receptor binding defect in GS and keloid cells."
"Desmoid tumors are often associated with familial polyposis of the colon with or without Gardner's syndrome. Recurrence rate and the invasive, aggressive character of these tumors is emphasized. The authors present three cases and discuss surgical and conservative treatment."
"Thirty-two primary desmoid tumors occurred in 29 patients. The median patient age was 32 years, and 55% of the patients were females. An antecedent history of trauma at the tumor site was elicited from 28% of patients. Thirty-one of 32 primary tumors were completely excised at initial presentation. Five tumors were treated with adjuvant radiotherapy. The overall recurrence rate for primary and recurrent lesions was 60%. The recurrence rate in children (88%) was more than twice that found in adults (38%). A single recurrence did not significantly increase the likelihood of a subsequent recurrence. Greater than 90% of all recurrences took place within 3 years of treatment. The rate of recurrence was not clearly influenced by the status of histologic margins, although this was examined in less than half the tumors. Desmoid tumors are aggressive neoplasms that exhibit a strong propensity for local recurrence. They should be treated as low-grade malignancies with documentation of histologic margins and close clinical follow-up within the framework of a tumor registry."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a rare tumor of the jaws. Its occurrence in the maxilla is even more exceptional. The case of a 14-year-old girl with a peripheral fibromatosis of the palatal process of the maxilla is described. The lesion manifested as a painless swelling. On initial excision, a diagnosis of fibroma was made. After recurrence and reevaluation of the microscopic slides, a final diagnosis of aggressive fibromatosis was established. The features of this case and 12 similar lesions of the maxilla previously described in the literature are analyzed and discussed."
"Computed tomography was carried out in 32 patients with clinically equivocal soft-tissue lesions of the hand (24 times) and forearm (8 times). The CT scans were performed with the patients in standard positions; thin slices and zoom technique were used. All soft-tissue tumors were correctly diagnosed with regard to localization, size and infiltration of the surrounding tissue. The histological diagnosis was correct in tendon-sheath proliferations, deposits caused by metabolic disorders, epithelial and ganglion cysts, hemangiomas, lipomas and in one schwannoma. A malignancy was suspected and was proven to be correct in two cases. False-positive diagnoses of a malignant soft-tissue tumor were made in one case of an aggressive fibromatosis, in a rapidly progressive, ossifying myositis, and three times in the presence of postoperative scar tissue following the resection of a sarcoma. Finally, a case of proliferative myositis regarded as semimalignant was underrated by CT. The hand surgeon considered CT diagnostics to be very helpful in planning operations in an anatomically complex organ such as the hand."
"(a) 26 patients who had had surgical resection for their primary fibromatosis but whose surgical margins were positive and who received no further treatment; and (b) 24 patients who were treated for their primary or recurrent fibromatosis by radiation alone or combined with surgery. For the 26 patients who were only observed, despite the positive surgical margins, 9 have recurred; the actuarial continuous local control rate at 5 years was 68% (a median follow-up of 70 months). Five patients had gross disease left after surgery and all of them failed. Seventeen of 21 patients who had grossly complete resection have local control; the four failures have been salvaged. This result supports the rationale for a no treatment but a thorough and close follow-up policy for patients with positive margins after grossly complete resection of a primary desmoid or fascial fibromatosis. There is no risk of metastasis in these patients and hence the effort toward a conservative policy which defers radiation merits interest and further study. Of the second group, 23 patients were treated for gross disease and one patient for microscopic disease after surgical resection. All of the 10 patients who were treated for primary desmoid tumor have local control. Among the 14 recurrent desmoid tumors there have been five local failures, after treatment by radiation alone or radiation + surgery. Three patients treated by radiation alone are currently scored as incompletely regressed tumors. Accordingly 16 of the 24 patients are scored as local controls without evidence of disease and 19 of the 24 are scored as local control (complete response or partial but stable response)."
"We have presented a case of mesenteric desmoid tumor, with analysis of 21 such cases previously reported in Japan."
"Odontogenic myxoma and particularly juvenile fibromatosis are rare benign tumors in the maxillo-facial region. The aggressive local and sometimes voluminous development of these tumors may necessitate partial mandibulectomy. Autologous bone graft from the iliac crest is the best material for mandibular reconstruction because of its functional and esthetic results. If osteosynthesis of the graft is achieved by means of internal wiring, several weeks of intermaxillary fixation are required, whereas internal rigid fixation with plate and screws allows the patient to open the mouth more rapidly."
"We report on a patient with chronic prostate disease diagnosed as having a pelvic desmoid tumor (abdominal fibromatosis localized to the pelvis) whose presenting features were those of complete acute urinary retention. The findings on initial examination led us to suspect a prostate neoplasm which, however, was discarded by the results of the radiographic work up. The clinical and pathologic findings are presented and attention is drawn to the possibility that these mesenchymal neoplasms can have urological presenting symptoms and signs."
"Aggressive juvenile fibromatosis is not metastasizing disease characterized by a neoplastic proliferation of fibroblasts that rarely involves surrounding bone. The Authors describe one case observed by them and suggest the surgical procedure as elective treatment of the disease. In cases where a mandibular resection is performed, a simultaneous bone reconstruction, when feasible, is indicated."
"A case of a woman who underwent a wide excision of an abdominal wall desmoid tumor is reported. The lesion was covered with Marlex mesh, and she went through an uncomplicated pregnancy and successful delivery. Management is described and discussed."
"Thirty-four cases of soft tissue tumors (STT) other than rhabdomyosarcoma in infants under 1 year of age were seen in our institution between 1955 and 1985. All were diagnosed initially as malignant tumors except for three cases of fibromatosis, and, thus, they received therapy appropriate at that time. During a recent pathologic review, four were seen to have had hemangioma, six hemangiopericytoma, one hamartoma, seven fibromatosis, eight fibrosarcoma, and eight unclassified sarcomas. Of these 34 cases, the initial histological diagnosis was confirmed in only 17. Sixteen patients were believed to have received inappropriately aggressive therapy; indeed, four of these cases diagnosed prior to 1975 had been benign. Major long-term side effects were seen in 7/16 treated patients (six radiotherapy, one surgery), who, in retrospect, should have received less aggressive treatment. The reasons for these initial errors in diagnosis included doubtful histologic features associated in some cases with alarming clinical presentation. We believe that difficulties still remain in distinguishing benign from malignant STT in this age group by histological examination. Therefore, we urge extreme caution in using aggressive therapy before the diagnosis is certain."
"Extensive fibromatosis, also called desmoid tumor, is a histologically benign tumor, which is nonetheless serious due to its recurrent character and to its potential for infiltration of neighboring tissues. Extensive surgery is the only effective means of treatment, radiation therapy being used only as a complement. The authors describe an elective location of the lesion in the sheaths of the scalenus muscles. This development is usually observed in young women, as is the case in the observation reported here."
"The popliteal fossa is a relatively small, muscle-bound strategic anatomical area where is found, on the posterior aspect of the knee, a vasculonervous pedicle and where both vascular and pseudovascular disease may develop, the latter originating from wall-constituting parts. Among non-typical popliteal diseases, the authors have singled out four rare syndromes. The popliteal vein may be trapped due to fibrous strangulation or, more often, to compression by the hypertrophied gastrocnemius muscle. This requires proper diagnosis and surgical management prior to thrombosis onset. Synovial cysts raise no diagnostic problems, unless they mimic an episode of phlebitis; echotomography has now become essential for diagnosis. Desmoid tumors for which predominant extra-abdominal occurrence sites are the popliteal fossa, the leg and thigh, are difficult to excise completely, especially at the popliteal level, and are a major technical challenge because of the inclusion of the vasculonervous pedicle. Lastly, in sports pathology, one must be able to recognize the painful fabella syndrome (osteochondritis of sesamoid fibrocartilage in lateral head of gastrocnemius), so as not to mistakenly implicate vascular disease. New developments in imaging (namely, real time CT-echography) are of major help to clinicists, who should, nonetheless, remain chiefly responsible for detecting these diseases."
"ovarian cyst, gelatinous disease of the peritoneum, desmoid tumor, lymphoma, lymphangiomyoma. The right diagnosis has been established as a last resort to immunocytochemistry."
"The authors present a case of fibromatosis in the breast in a young nulliparous patient. These are rare tumours comparable to abdominal desmoid tumours. They are characterised by their ability to recur if spread locally, that is why they have to be widely removed. After having studied the anatomical and clinical characteristics as well as the biological ones of breast fibromatoses the authors discuss the problems of nosology which are often very difficult for this kind of a tumour and also of the therapy that has to be adapted."
"The authors report on a case of mesenteric fibromatosis in a 5 month-old infant. Surgical excision was available and the clinical course was good, without recurrence after 30 months. Clinical and histological features of mesenteric desmoid tumor in children are discussed and diagnostic difficulties are examined in depth."
"Magnetic resonance imaging of seven patients with eight pathologically proven desmoid tumor tumors was performed and retrospectively reviewed. On T2-weighted images, all but one lesion demonstrated increased signal intensity relative to muscle, and had signal intensity similar to that of fat. The signal was heterogenous in six of these seven lesions. In a patient with synchronous multicentric lesions, light microscopy correlation revealed increased cellularity in one lesion with increased signal intensity and dense collagenous elements in a second lesion, with decreased signal intensity. High signal intensity appears to be typical but nonspecific, and in following these patients could indicate recurrent tumor, superimposed inflammatory process or granulation tissue."
"We describe the fourth case of aggressive fibromatosis of the larynx arising in an adult. Most cases of laryngeal fibromatosis have been described in children. In the larynx it may behave the same as in other sites, with local aggressiveness but without metastasis. The possible differential diagnoses are discussed."
"Odontogenic myxoma and particularly juvenile fibromatosis are rare benign tumors in the maxillo-facial region. The aggressive local and sometimes voluminous development of these tumors may necessitate partial mandibulectomy. Autologous bone graft from the iliac crest is the best material for mandibular reconstruction because of its functional and esthetic results. If osteosynthesis of the graft is achieved by means of internal wiring, several weeks of intermaxillary fixation are required, whereas internal rigid fixation with plate and screws allows the patient to open the mouth more rapidly."
"Recent advances in the understanding of desmoid tumor biology affect therapeutic choices. This series of 19 patients and review of the literature outlines historic perspectives and discusses the options in the management of these locally aggressive tumors. Desmoid tumors tend to grow steadily, regardless of tumor location. However differences in the aggressive nature of these tumors are seen when age and sex distributions are scrutinized. Although recurrence rates are high, excisional therapy is the best first approach. An exception is the case in which tumor excision is either particularly dangerous or likely to result in significant physical handicap. Radiation or drug therapy are most often used with recurrent disease or as an alternative to mutilating surgery. Although many pharmacologic approaches have been advocated, (including antiestrogen therapy, cyclic-AMP, and prostaglandin inhibition), results are anecdotal at best."

A case of a girl who developed severe dysphagia from an aggressive fibromatosis involving the cervical esophagus is reported. A 3 x 4 cm unencapsulated fibrous tumor was completely excised with the involved esophageal wall. The esophageal defect was bridged by an inverted skin tube with good functional and cosmetic results. Eight years later the patient is disease-free. Primary radical excision is the treatment of choice of aggressive fibromatosis.
"A 14-year-old patient who was eventually found to have Gardner syndrome initially presented at the age of 3 years with a desmoid tumor involving the scalp. A careful review of the family history revealed a high incidence of colonic cancer, which prompted endoscopic evaluation of the patient. The discovery of adenomatous polyps in the colon confirmed the diagnosis of Gardner syndrome. In patients with hard or soft tissue tumors, the possibility of Gardner syndrome should be kept in mind, and a thorough family history taken. Early diagnosis may prevent malignant transformation of colonic polyps."
"Twenty-six patients with extra-abdominal desmoid tumor are reported. The tumor was located in the head and neck (6 cases), chest wall (3 cases), arm and leg (9 cases), paravertebral tissue (6 cases) and in the abdomen (2 cases). Of the 26 patients, 17 were treated for the first time and 9 had recurrent lesions. This tumor, showing aggressive growth, involved peripheral nerves (7 cases), blood vessels (4 cases), bones (11 cases) or viscera (2 cases). Surgery is the treatment of choice. The recurrence rate was 11% in those who received their first treatment. Wide dissection led to lower recurrence than simple excision (23% vs 72%). The authors stress the importance of excising at least 2-3 cm beyond the tumor margin and extra-abdominal desmoid tumor should be treated as a soft tissue tumor with low malignancy."
"Aggressive fibromatoses are locally invasive, non-metastasising, fibroblastic soft-tissue tumours. On the basis of examinations made in 6 patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis, the reliability of different imaging modalities in preoperative diagnosis and in follow-up is discussed. The inhomogeneous tumour composition was evident in all imaging procedures. Computed tomography offered the highest sensitivity for tumour detection and proved accurate in demonstrating the characteristic radial tumour spreading of mesenteric aggressive fibromatosis; the attenuation values ranged from 18 to 58 HU. in pre-contrast CT scans. In magnetic resonance imaging the tumours mostly produced a low signal in T1- and T2-weighted sequences; the calculated T2-relaxation times ranged from 97 to 186 ms."
"We report 23 children with soft-tissue tumors of the hand and wrist. Tumors of blood and lymph vessel origin accounted for nine patients; giant-cell tumors of tendon sheaths and tumoral calcinosis occurred in four patients each and soft-tissue chondroma in three. Synovial osteochondromatosis and aggressive fibromatosis were each represented by one patient. Finally, there was one child with a malignant soft-tissue tumor, an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of the hand. Hand and wrist ganglia were excluded. Imaging methods used in investigating hand and wrist lesions are discussed but plain radiography remains the first and often only examination necessary."
"Aggressive infantile fibromatosis is an unusual, tumor-like, proliferative lesion which grows infiltratively. The clinical and histological features of aggressive infantile fibromatosis in the submandibular region of a 3-year-old girl are reported."

"Desmoplastic fibroma (DF) of bone is a rare, nonmetastasizing but locally aggressive tumor that has been discussed infrequently in the radiology literature. The radiographs from 107 previously published cases of DF and seven cases from the authors' institution were analyzed to better understand and define its radiographic characteristics. DF was most common in the mandible, pelvis, and femur. A geographic pattern of bone destruction, with a narrow zone of transition and nonsclerotic margins, was seen in 80 (96%) patients with intraosseous DF for whom radiographs were available (83 patients). Internal pseudotrabeculation was seen in 76 (91%). Although widening of the host bone due to gradual apposition of periosteal new bone was common, occurring in 74 (89%) patients, distinct periosteal new bone occurred in only two (2%) patients with DF of intraosseous origin. The cortex was breached in 23 (28%) patients. Three cases of DF arising in the periosteum were identified and were differentiated radiographically from desmoid tumors of intraosseous or soft-tissue origin."
"Desmoid tumours are benign neoplasias manifesting themselves clinically as aggressive fibromatoses. They may be sited both in mesenteric and retroperitoneal fat. Owing to the great size they reach and to their local infiltrative character they occasionally lead to the development of intestinal occlusive syndromes and, in exceptional cases, to obstructive uropathy of the upper urinary tract. Their incidence of presentation in the general population is low, however they develop more frequently in patients suffering from colonic polyposis in the family and they form part of the extracolonic manifestations of Gardner's syndrome. In 1987 we treated a young patient, a genetic carrier of familiar colonic polyposis who had presented relapse of a previous desmoid. The location of the tumour in narrow pelvis made its clinical debut as a intestinal pseudo-occlusion and determined a bilateral ureteral obstruction and the formation of a major urinoma. The joint utilization of instrumental maneuvers and surgical approaches enabled us to solve the intestinal and urological commitment satisfactorily. We carry out an overall review and analyse the data published on the incidence, prognosis and treatment of obstructive uropathy in Gardner's syndrome. We also carry out an updating on the biology of the desmoid tumour."
"Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver is not common. Of the 76 patients who underwent hepatectomy in our hospital from 1986-1988, 4 had inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver. It comprised 5.2% of patients subjected to liver resection during the same period. These 4 patients were misdiagnosed as primary liver cancer and desmoid tumor of the upper abdominal wall by ultrasonography and CT scan before operation. The inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver had long clinical course, less symptoms, and clear capsule, tenacity in nature and no liver cirrhosis on operation. The patients received modified hepatectomy without any postoperative complications. Hepatic resection is the treatment of choice. If contra-indicated, steroid can be used."
"Aggressive fibromatosis is a poorly defined, locally aggressive, yet histologically benign fibroblastic proliferative lesion that may occur in the head and neck. The lesion is highly cellular and locally infiltrative and has a propensity to invade and erode bone, compromising vital structures within the head and neck. However, it is not a true malignancy because it does not have malignant cytologic characteristics nor does it metastasize. We present two cases of aggressive fibromatosis occurring in young adult men. The first case involved a rapidly enlarging mass of the anterior maxilla that involved the upper lip, nasal alae, nasal septum, inferior turbinates, and hard palate. The patient underwent incisional biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Because of difficulty in determining the actual margins of this extensive lesion and the significant morbidity that would have resulted from surgical resection, we elected to treat this patient with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The second case was an extensive lesion involving the right temporal bone, pterygomaxillary space, and infratemporal, temporal, and middle cranial fossae. Incisional biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. Because of the lack of functional and cosmetic deficits and the unavoidable morbidity of a surgical resection, this patient was treated with radiation therapy. Although wide field resection is the most satisfactory form of treatment, in situations in which this modality would result in unacceptable morbidity or if surgical margins are positive, then radiation therapy and chemotherapy should be considered. Support for these therapeutic modalities is found in larger series of cases outside the head and neck."
"Desmoid tumors are rare, being less than 0.03 per cent of all neoplasms. Because of scarcity of data and relatively small numbers of patients, optimal treatment remains controversial. In this report, our experience with 36 patients evaluated and treated from 1960 to 1987 is analyzed. The most common primary site was the wall of the chest (ten); eight tumors originated in the abdominal wall. Nine patients had a history of previous trauma, and eight of these were women. Thirty-two patients had wide local excision and two had amputations. Clear margins were obtained in only 22 patients despite an attempt at wide resection in all instances. With a mean follow-up period of 41 months and a median of 24 months, only one of 22 patients with negative histologic margins had recurrence of tumor. Among the 11 patients with positive margins, four received postoperative radiation therapy and two remain disease-free; of the seven remaining patients with positive margins, three had recurrences. One patient with unresectable disease was treated with tamoxifen with regression of tumor and remains alive 15 months later. These data suggest that the best treatment of desmoid tumors remains resection with a clear margin of normal tissue surrounding the tumor. Adjuvant radiotherapy did not appear to decrease the rate of local recurrence."
"Elastofibroma dorsi was diagnosed in seven patients at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center between 1976 and 1986. The ages of the patients ranged from 6 to 79 years (mean 49.3 years). No sex predominance was seen. Five cases of unilateral subscapular tumor and two cases of bilateral masses were identified. Four patients had pain with arm motion, and the remaining patients were free of symptoms. A nonencapsulated soft tissue mass elevating the scapula was identified by computed tomography. Incisional biopsy was performed in all cases, followed by local excision of the tumor. On gross examination, these lesions were firm and rubbery. Histologic evaluation demonstrated a slightly hypercellular fibrous tissue that contained variable numbers of fragmented elastic fibers. All patients with symptomatic tumors had complete relief of their pain after the operation. No recurrences were observed. Clinically, elastofibroma may mimic sarcoma and fibromatosis (extraabdominal desmoid tumors). Whether elastofibroma is a true neoplasm or a reactive fibrous lesion that produces not only collagen, but also abnormal elastic fibers, has been the subject of controversy and remains undetermined."
"From 1975 to 1986, 26 patients with soft tissue tumors of the extremities underwent a total of 29 perfusions. The cytostatics used were doxorubicin (Adriamycin, Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) (19 perfusions), melphalan (two perfusions), and a combination of these agents (eight perfusions). Before perfusion most patients had been treated by surgical excision(s), radiotherapy, or systemic chemotherapy. Of 17 patients perfused because of local inoperable tumor, four showed prolonged complete remission of the tumor mass, stable disease was seen in three, and ten showed progression. The complete remissions observed in three patients with aggressive fibromatosis and in one with lymphangiosarcoma occurred after perfusion with doxorubicin combined with melphalan. Doxorubicin added to the perfusate as the sole cytostatic was not effective. Local recurrence was observed in five of nine patients treated by adjuvant perfusion, always after dubiously radical tumor excision. Toxicity was high, especially in the first few years. Tissue necrosis necessitated amputation in three cases (in two after perfusion with doxorubicin and melphalan and in one after repeated perfusion with doxorubicin only). This complication was no longer seen after adjustment of the dosage and dose distribution of doxorubicin, but the morbidity after perfusion with doxorubicin remained considerable."
"Aggressive fibromatoses (desmoid tumours) tend to grow in an infiltrative and destructive manner without metastases. Computed tomography of aggressive fibromatoses yields no uniform attenuation pattern. The tumours are typically isodense when no contrast medium is used and enhance clearly to hyperdense during infusion of contrast medium. In magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) a high signal (long T2) on T2-weighted pulse sequences as well as an accumulation of i.v. Gd-DTPA seems to be the characteristic appearance of aggressive fibromatoses, although different signal intensities can be seen. The MRT histopathologic correlation shows increasing signal intensities on T2-weighted sequences dependent on an increment in cellular content of the tumours. Only histopathological methods can provide a definite diagnosis."
"Aggressive infantile fibromatosis, one of the juvenile fibromatoses, is generally considered a benign lesion, but it does tend to recur locally because of its invasive nature. Distant metastases are considered rare. This case report documents pulmonary metastases arising 2 years after resection of the primary lesion from the thigh of an infant. This is the seventh reported case of distant metastasis from aggressive infantile fibromatosis. Computed tomography of the original lesion as well as the metastases are presented."
"The aggressive fibromatosis is a surgical problem disease. Two remarkable cases serve as examples to demonstrate the aggressive forms of extraabdominal fibromatosis. There is a tendency to locally invasive destructive growth without metastasising at any time and a markedly high relapse rate after surgery, a tendency that showed up clearly in our patients, too. The very multivarious nomenclature points out that about histiogenesis, pathogenesis and benignity of this excrescence still exists great obscurity. We report on the pathology and clinic of an aggressive fibromatosis of the thyroid gland region and of a thoracal aggressive fibromatosis in the right shoulderblade-region."
"A 47-year-old anemic Jehovah's Witness with Gardner's syndrome presented with a large abdominal wall desmoid tumor requiring extensive resection with a musculocutaneous flap reconstruction. At surgery a technique of acute limited normovolemic hemodilution (ALNH) was used to minimize blood loss and avoid blood transfusions. Complications that follow transfusions of homologous blood are reviewed, and a recommendation is made to use ALNH because of its advantages in those patients in whom significant blood loss is expected."
"A 34-year-old man was found to have rectal adenocarcinoma 4 years after diagnosis of mesenteric fibromatosis. Radical excision of the fibromatosis was not feasible and the fibromatous infiltration slowly progressed retroperitoneally, obstructing ureters and colon. Patients with abdominal fibromatosis may be at a risk of developing colonic carcinoma due to coexisting colonic adenomatosis."
"A case of aggressive fibromatosis of the tongue is described in a 9-year-old boy. Magnetic resonance was used in the initial evaluation and revealed a well defined mass in the anterior third of the tongue which was mildly hypointense on a T1-weighted image and minimally hyperintense on a T2-weighted image. Magnetic resonance was useful in indicating the benign nature of the tumor, in defining its extent, and for follow-up after local surgical resection."
"(1) age between 18 and 30 years, (2) presentation with recurrent disease, (3) partial or limited margin excision, (4) tumor at or close to the microscopic margin of resection, and (5) radiation therapy not administered for gross residual disease. Multivariate analysis identified two of these factors as having independent predictive value for recurrence: (1) presentation with recurrent disease and (2) less-than-adequate margins of resection. The five-year survival probability was 92%, but 11 of the 138 patients died as a consequence of locally uncontrolled tumor. These findings confirm that desmoid tumors are malignant soft-tissue neoplasms that warrant aggressive therapy."
"A 43-year-old woman with familial polyposis coli (FPC) and adenocarcinoma of the rectosigmoid was treated by total colectomy, mucosal proctectomy and construction of an ileal pouch with ileoanal anastomosis. A year after operation she developed a huge retroperitoneal desmoid tumor which on exploratory laparotomy was found to be nonresectable. A 21-month course of indomethacin followed by tamoxifen failed to induce regression of the tumor. Desmoid tumors appear in 3.5-29.0% of patients with FPC, mostly after colectomy. This possibility must be considered in the differential diagnosis of recurrent carcinoma of the colon. The preferred treatment of abdominal and retroperitoneal desmoid tumors is conservative, and includes the use of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs, ascorbic acid and tamoxifen."
A case of bilateral ovarian fibromatosis and massive oedema with subsequent intra-abdominal fibromatosis which underwent an aggressive and fatal course is described. This is the first report of co-existence of these two conditions and the possible relationship between them is discussed.
"lipomas cysts, hematomas, neuromas, desmoid tumors, hemangiomas, by contrast analysis and morphologic aspects; sometimes, malignant lesions are suspected on particular anatomic criteria. MRI is excellent in the evaluation of local extension. MRI can therefore be performed when the staging of soft tissue tumor is incompletely provided by other investigations (CT or US)."
"Esorubicin was administered to 12 patients with soft tissue sarcoma, 1 osteosarcoma and 1 desmoid tumor. Seven patients had never received chemotherapy before. Myelotoxicity was the main side effect, leukopenia being more pronounced than thrombocytopenia. No significant nonhematological toxicity occurred. Six patients had no change of median duration of 98 days and 7 patients progressed. The patient suffering from multiple-site lesions of a desmoid tumor obtained a long-lasting partial response. This study does not support further testing of esorubicin in sarcoma patients."
Aggressive fibromatosis is a surgical problem due to its tendency to recur following excision. The imaging methods available are presented and their diagnostic value discussed. A combination of different investigative procedures allows preoperative assessment of tumor type and extent and accurate planning of surgical procedure.
"Three cases of maxillo-mandibular desmoplastic fibroma are added to the 41 cases already described in the literature. A synthesis of the actual knowledge concerning the tumor is presented. The tumor is mainly composed of fibrous tissue with bundles of mature collagen, and can be easily confused with a low grade fibrosarcoma. Most of the patients are caucasian males. It is a young people tumor (0 to 30 years) with a peak between 6 to 15 years. The mandible was involved in 36 cases and the maxilla in 8 cases. The left side was involved in a ratio of 2 to 1 compared to the right side. In the mandible, the tumor was observed most frequently in the body and at the angle of the jaw. Pain or tumefaction were the most prevalent clinical features. The etiology of the tumor is unclear but trauma is often implicated. When the treatment is conservative, recurrences are frequent. The maxillo-mandibular desmoplastic fibroma should be recognized early to avoid local tissue destruction."
"We report a new case of aggressive juvenile fibromatosis (A.J.F.) in a 20-month-old girl. The lesion affected the inferior border of the left mandible and the adjacent soft tissues. The child presented with a painless mass, which had grown over a period of 2 months. Radiographs and computed tomographic scan showed a multilacunar bone defect with subcutaneous and gingival involvement. A biopsy was performed, followed by a partial hemimandibulectomy and a costal graft. The surgical specimen measured 4 X 3 X 3 cm. The patient did well 1 year after surgery. 16 cases of A.J.F. have been reported; with ours, 14 are mandibular. A.J.F. is a locally aggressive lesion, which doesn't metastasize. It occurs chiefly in childhood and adolescence from 1 1/2 to 18 years (median 6.5 year-old). Duration of symptoms prior to presentation varies from a few weeks to months. Clinically, it is a firm nodule. Radiographs are non-specific, but 9 cases have poorly defined destruction of the mandibular inferior border. Following a block resection of the tumor (13 cases), there is no recurrence. In this review, we discuss the clinico-pathologic diagnosis of this impressive tumor which is compared with other mandibular fibrous tumors in children."
"The authors describe a case of a desmoid tumor of the anterior abdominal wall. From a review of the world literature, the main characteristics of these tumors are detailed, and the various pathophysiological hypotheses, demonstrating the necessity of exclusively surgical treatment, are presented."
"Radionuclide imaging of benign soft-tissue tumors sometimes associated with extremity enlargement (7 patients) and/or osteodysplasia (6 patients) has demonstrated, in a total of 18 patients, several differentiating patterns of accumulation of Technetium-99m diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (Tc-99m DTPA). Early imaging (within 15 min) as well as later imaging (one-half hour to 3 hours following the intravenous injection of the radiopharmaceutical) has shown that fatty tumors (lipomas, lipoblastomas, fibrofatty tissue) do not concentrate the isotope. Neurofibromas display gradual intensification of their radioactive content, while hemangiomas differ in their scintigraphic pattern depending on their histologic composition. Purely capillary hemangiomas have transient early intense activity while purely cavernous hemangiomas display no early activity but are well visualized on delayed scintigraphic images. Mixed hemangiomas display combined imaging characteristics of both capillary and cavernous types with the predominant pattern dependent upon the predominant histology. Aggressive fibromatosis exhibited an early fleeting display of intense radioactivity."
"Desmoid tumors of the head and neck are uncommon and associated with a posttreatment recurrence rate as high as 70 percent. This study was undertaken to determine cure rates achievable by surgery and radiotherapy and the factors influencing failure. A chart review of all patients at our institution with desmoid tumors of the head and neck from 1919 to 1982 was undertaken, and pertinent data were tabulated. Forty-eight patients were found with this problem. Average duration of symptoms was 1.6 years, and tumor size ranged from 1 to 12 cm (mean 5.1 cm). Average follow-up was 5.8 years. The most common site of occurrence was the neck (34 patients). Thirty-two patients underwent complete excision with 8 recurrences; 4 were reexcised with no further recurrence at last follow-up. Fourteen patients had incomplete excision with 12 recurrences. Radiotherapy was employed as the primary therapy in two patients; both experienced recurrence. Complete excision is the only effective treatment for desmoid tumors of the head and neck, resulting in a disease-free state in 75 percent of the patients (87 percent after reexcision). Involvement of the brachial plexus was the chief factor precluding complete excision. Radiotherapy was of very little value."

"A case of omento-mesenterial fibromatosis in a 6-year-old boy revealing through acute intestinal obstruction is reported. Mesenterial fibromatosis, also known as aggressive fibromatosis or desmoid tumor is generally associated with Gardner's syndrome but otherwise an extremely rare disease. Fibromatoses do not metastasize but are characterized by a high incidence of local recurrence. Primary treatment is operative. After multiple recurrence irradiation, cytostatics and antiestrogens have been used additionally to control the disease."
"The oncology group at Tulane has been instrumental in the development of isolated regional perfusion techniques for treatment of melanomas. The perfusion is usually accompanied by wide excision. Our success encouraged similar attempts with persistent, widely invasive desmoid tumors. We used regional chemotherapy in conjunction with wide excision in four cases. Neither the technique nor combination chemotherapy has been used previously against desmoid tumors. Tumor response occurred with nitrogen mustard and with combinations of actinomycin D, thiotepa, and methotrexate. Additionally, one apparent response followed testolactone and chlorothiazide therapy."
"Aggressive desmoid tumors present difficult problems among patients with Gardner's syndrome. Recently, attention has been directed toward metabolic or hormonal manipulation of these tumors. A 21-year-old woman with Gardner's syndrome was admitted because of recurrent abdominal wall tumors. She was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tamoxifen, and ascorbate for seven months. During this therapy, CT scan showed a gradual increase in size of the tumors. Subsequent resection of the abdominal tumors and the colon was performed. Although these three types of drugs were administered to prevent postoperative recurrence, an abdominal wall desmoid tumor that invaded the mesentery developed within nine months. The known treatments, that is, chemotherapy, irradiation, and surgical resection are discussed in view of this experience."
"Twenty-six adult patients with the pathologic diagnosis of desmoid tumor were treated between 1964 and 1983 at the Institut Curie in Paris with megavoltage irradiation. Twenty of these patients (76 percent) had extraabdominal tumors. Definitive surgical resection was performed on nine patients (one received preoperative radiotherapy). At last follow-up 1 1/2 to 10 years after treatment, all of the patients had no evidence of disease. Seven of the nine had follow-up examinations from 5 to 10 years after treatment. Seven patients had postoperative radiotherapy with doses from 4,700 to 6,500 rads (47 to 65 Gy) for either microscopic (three patients) or gross (four patients) residual disease. All but one patient had no evidence of disease from 2 to 8 years after treatment. Nine patients had radiotherapy for recurrent inoperable tumors and six had no evidence of disease from 3 to 20 years after treatment. Recurrences developed in three patients; outside the treatment portal in one, and the other two had received less than 5,000 rads (50 Gy). Clinical regression of tumors after treatment was slow, with complete regression taking up to 2 years. Postoperative radiotherapy with doses of at least 5,000 to 6,000 rads (50 to 60 Gy) was effective in achieving local control of inoperable or incompletely resected tumors, thus the need for repeated resections was avoided. Computerized tomography has greatly improved the assessment of tumor extension and should be used routinely before either operation or radiotherapy to obtain adequate margins and minimize the chance of missing disease."
"Fifty-three histologically confirmed soft tissue masses in 48 patients were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MR) and computerized tomography (CT). Twenty-three of these were malignant, twenty-three benign and seven of intermediate malignancy (all aggressive fibromatosis). The two procedures were compared for sensitivity and delineation of masses, their relationship to important neurovascular structures, their potential for histological diagnoses, their relative roles in influencing the surgical approach and the preferred modality in the follow-up for detection of tumor recurrence. Both modalities have their relative strengths and weaknesses. However, the superior contrast resolution of magnetic resonance imaging, its demonstration of lesions not clearly identified by CT, its pluridirectional capabilities and its ability to demonstrate large soft tissue tumors in a single coronal or sagittal plane makes it the preferred initial modality for evaluation of the soft tissue tumor of uncertain etiology and also in the follow-up of these patients. Despite MR's superiority in anatomically staging soft tissue tumors it, like CT, is of limited value in characterizing soft tissue sarcomas."
"(1) when the tumor cannot be resected with histologically clear margins, or when resection margins are questionable; (2) when the patient is 30 years old or younger; (3) when the tumor is inoperable, or resectable only by means of a mutilating operation. For patients between 30 and 40 years of age, the question of postoperative radiotherapy should be discussed with the radiation oncologist, even following a microscopically complete resection."
"Fibromatosis is an aggressive, non-metastasizing disease characterized by a neoplastic proliferation of fibroblasts, that rarely involves bone and lies on the borderline between benign and malignant tumours. We report three new cases of this rare entity."
?
"Musculoskeletal desmoid tumors can be difficult to characterize and to follow. The rate of regression after radiotherapy is variable, with poor response to chemotherapy and postoperative recurrence being common. Eighteen patients undergoing therapy for proven musculoskeletal desmoid tumors had 52 CT studies, which were assessed to determine the utility of CT in following such patients. Computed tomography was found to offer excellent initial baselines prior to additional treatment and in the early postoperative period and followed the tumor response to treatment. Ultimate tumor response could not be predicted by characteristics of or change in tumor margins, by initial or subsequent tumor CT attenuation, by appearance following intravenous contrast medium, or by tumor location. Decreasing size and stabilization of size in a previously growing lesion were the only reliable signs of response; markedly increasing attenuation heterogeneity suggested but was unreliable as an isolated sign of response."
"Seven cases of fibromatoses in infancy and childhood serve as examples to demonstrate this group of rare tumours, taking especially the aggressive forms of juvenile fibromatoses into account. There is a tendency to locally invasive destructive growth without metastasising at any time and a markedly high relapse rate after surgery--a tendency that showed up clearly in our patients, too. Only one child out of four having infantile (desmoid-type) fibromatosis of different localisation did not show any recurrence. The article reports, among other cases, on a desmoid of the stomach and oesophagus in a 15-year-old girl, not described in the literature so far, and on a congenital fibromatosis of the pancreas. Several classifications had to be performed to properly grade the individual cases (1, 6), since no generally valid systematic description of these tumours exists."
?
"A patient with a huge pelvic fibromatosis, a form of intra-abdominal desmoid, encroaching on the urinary bladder is described. Because of its rarity, there is frequently a lack of diagnostic awareness of this tumor, particularly in the gynecological or urological patient. Although this tumor is a locally invasive benign tumor which dose not metastasize, management by radical tumor excision without the sacrifice of the major pelvic nerves and vessels is mandatory, since this tumor has generally a high postsurgical recurrence rate."
"Synchronous multicentric aggressive fibromatosis does not appear to have been previously reported. Two such cases are described. The tumors were identified by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The incidence of synchronous multicentric aggressive fibromatosis is not known. It is anticipated that increased use of coronal MR imaging will reveal more tumors of this type, both synchronous and metachronous. In a patient with known or suspected aggressive fibromatosis, every other soft tissue nodule or mass in the same limb has to be regarded as an additional tumor of the same histology."
"A series of soft tissue tumors, melanomas, carcinomas, and lymphomas were studied immunohistochemically for the presence of muscle actins (MA) with the monoclonal antibody HHF-35, and for the presence of desmin for comparison. In nonneoplastic tissues, MA immunoreactivity was present in skeletal and smooth muscle cells, in the pericytes of small vessels, and in the myoepithelial cells. Desmin immunoreactivity had a similar distribution, except that the pericytes of small vessels and myoepithelial cells were negative. All 17 rhabdomyosarcomas were positive for both MA and desmin. Of leiomyosarcomas, 31/32 were positive for MA, and 29/32 for desmin. In pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcomas (malignant fibrous histiocytomas) MA and desmin-positive cells were present in 9/35 and 5/35 cases, respectively. Three of five pleomorphic liposarcomas showed MA-positive tumor cells, which were also desmin-positive in one case. Desmoid tumors often showed a moderate number of both desmin- and MA-positive cells. Hemangiopericytoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, and endometrial stromal sarcoma showed MA-positive staining only in the pericytes and not in the neoplastic cells. In various types of carcinomas, melanomas, and lymphomas, MA- or desmin-positive neoplastic cells were not identified. MA, but not desmin, was present in the desmoplastic stroma in many carcinomas. Both MA and desmin are good markers for muscle differentiation and especially serve to identify rhabdomyosarcomas and leiomyosarcomas. These markers are also present in some sarcomas currently regarded as nonmuscle tumors. This may suggest that some of these tumors have differentiation properties related to true myosarcomas. The absence of muscle actin, a pericytic marker, in hemangiopericytoma does not confirm the concept of pericytic nature of this tumor."
"A 21-year-old male patient was treated for idiopathic scoliosis in a general orthopedic practice. Despite treatment a steady increase of lumbar bulging was noted. An extensive soft tissue tumor was found to be the cause of this. The tumor was resected locally at the orthopedic department and was found to be histologically an aggressive fascial fibromatosis. Radiologically the vertebral column showed hemihypertrophy of the pedicles and transverse processes of Th 10 through Th 12 on the ipsilateral side. Since the resection could not be considered radical, local radiation was applied with telecobalt (60 Gy focal doses). Three years later, there is no sign of local recurrence."
?
"Desmoplastic fibroma of bone is a rare benign tumor, first described by Jaffe in 1958. Since then approximately 80 cases have been reported in the long bones, although the tumor also involves the jaw bones, particularly the mandible. The plain film features consist of a lytic, expansile lesion, usually in the metaphysis of bone, sometimes extending into the soft tissues. We present two cases involving the long bones in which the correct diagnosis was suggested by computed tomography (CT). The CT appearance of the lesions is described."
"after a very short period of time, the tumor regressed spontaneously."
?
"Juvenile Aggressive Fibromatosis (JAF) is histologically characterized by a fibroblastic cellular proliferation. Even though benign, it is locally invasive and very often recurrent but never induces metastasis; the evolutionary argument is the only one which enables us to differentiate JAF from fibrosarcoma. The selected treatment is extensive surgical excision including healthy tissue with histological control. The prognosis is variable depending upon localization and therapeutic possibilities. We report the case of a seven year-old girl presenting an eyelid localization which is seldom reported. The extraorbital and intracranial extension was fatal in spite of the therapy associating surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The central nervous system proximity poses a difficult problem and speaks for an early mutilating surgery. However, the small number of published cases does not yet allow codification of treatment."
?
"Three cases of the so-called Schloffer tumour are presented. It is a rare inflammatory pseudotumour of the abdominal wall with aggressive connective tissue proliferation which frequently infiltrates neighbouring abdominal organs. Usually this tumour occurs several years after abdominal surgery or trauma, thus posing substantial problems in the interpretation of the clinical and morphological findings. In one of our male patients for instance, a sarcoma of the abdominal wall was suspected pre- and intraoperatively. A female patient was falsely considered to have a carcinoma of the urinary bladder. The lesion belongs to the reactive tumour-like fibromatoses and has to be distinguished from genuine soft tissue tumours, especially the abdominal desmoid."
"Forty two patients with abdominal wall desmoid tumor, including one Gardner's syndrome, are reported. All patients were female except one. The tumor occurred in various sites in the abdominal wall, 66% in the lower abdominal wall. The fascia, sheath and muscle layer were chiefly involved and a very large tumor could invade peritoneum and viscera. This tumor shows aggressive growth and is prone to recurrence. Surgery is the treatment of choice. Local recurrence rate was 5.5%. Abdominal wall desmoid tumor associated colonic polyposis is named Gardner's syndrome. The authors emphasize that a local extended resection should be performed with a safety margin at least 2-3 cm beyond the tumor. Peritoneum, if involved, should be resected together with the primary focus."
"Seven familial polyposis patients with desmoid tumors were treated with indomethacin, sulindac, or tamoxifen either as single agents or in combination. Serial computed tomographic (CT) scan examination was employed for objective measurement of tumor size since physical examination alone was an inaccurate means to evaluate intraabdominal and retroperitoneal desmoids. Only one patient with minimal tumor burden demonstrated a favorable response with complete resolution of an abdominal wall desmoid."
"Between 1968 and 1985, we treated 20 children for fibromatosis (also called desmoid tumor and aggressive fibromatosis). The primary sites included head and neck (seven patients), extremity (seven patients), and trunk (six patients). Lesions ranged from 3 to 18 cm in diameter. The tumors were smaller than 5 cm in 13 patients, and in seven patients they were larger than 5 cm. A total resection was not feasible in any of the patients with lesions larger than 5 cm. Ten of the 11 patients treated with wide local resection, in whom the margins were clearly negative or close, remained free of disease for six to 16 years. Nine patients required additional treatment with radiotherapy (nine patients) and chemotherapy (five patients). Two died of local disease progression. In the remaining seven children, the disease was controlled. We describe our strategies for managing this disease in a pediatric population."
"Although musculoaponeurotic fibromatosis (MAF) is a well-recognized entity, it still provides a histologic diagnostic enigma, particularly in its distinction from a well-differentiated fibrosarcoma. The lesion is histologically identical to a desmoid tumor. The lesion appears as a firm swelling in a limb or limb girdle, with a rare incidence of pain. Although it is more common in the second to fourth decades (premenopausal women predominantly), it does occur in children. The sex incidence in children is equal. A multicentric pattern of behavior may be evident. The mainstay of treatment has been surgical excision of varying extent. Local excision, even if radical, may be followed by up to a 65% recurrence rate. In this review, 40% of the cases had more than one recurrence. Recent evidence suggests radiotherapy, which has been reserved for inoperable lesions, may be of value as an adjunct to primary treatment. Limited local excision with adjunctive radiotherapy may decrease recurrence rate, minimize functional deficit, and improve cosmesis. Radical local resection (compartmental or amputation) may be avoidable. In children, amputation may not result in cure because of the multicentric behavior pattern and radiotherapy may lead to growth retardation. A shorter functional upper or lower limb is preferable to an amputation stump or a limb disfigured from radical excision."
"A 30-year-old female with mesenteric fibromatosis (MF) associated with familial colonic polyposis (FCP) was reported together with a review of Japanese cases of simple MF. Intestinal surgery can contribute to the pathogenesis of MF more intensely in cases associated with FCP than in simple MF cases. Furthermore, the biological behaviour of MF seems to be more aggressive in the former than in the latter."
"The ultrasonographic (US) appearance of the normal small bowel mesenteric leaves was evaluated in two in vitro studies and in 30 patients. Such structures had an elongated shape, echogenic surfaces, and small vessels in their center and could be recognized in 28 of the 30 patients. They did not show active movements, and at their distal end, the small bowel loops could be seen and peristalsis detected. Doppler signals were obtained from the small vascular structures in their center in three additional cases. On the basis of these anatomic findings, pathologic changes such as lymphoma, desmoid tumor, metastatic lesions, dilated vessels, and edema could be detected in 15 patients. When examining with US patients with diseases prone to involve the mesentery, careful attention should be given to this structure, since useful information about the abdominal spread of the disease can be obtained."
?
"A huge abdominal mass developed 4 years after successful chemotherapy and laparotomy for stage III embryonal testicular cancer. Complete surgical extirpation proved that this lesion was a desmoid tumor of the abdominal wall and not a recurrent germ cell neoplasm. Fortunately, this mass was excised and not treated by aggressive chemotherapy."
The development of an abdominal mass after radical extirpative surgery for cancer is ominous and most frequently represents a recurrence of the original cancer. We present an unusual case of a large mesenteric desmoid tumor that occurred 3 years after salvage cystectomy for invasive bladder cancer.
"Eight cases of extraabdominal desmoid tumors in children are reviewed. Seven were located in the pelvis or forearm, and the most common presenting complaint was a slowly enlarging mass. In all cases, diagnosis was established by open biopsy, and initial treatment was by surgical excision. At follow-up (average, 5.8 years), six patients were tumor free. Desmoids are benign tumors that usually carry a good prognosis. There is no difference between the tumor behavior in children and adults. The treatment of choice is wide local excision. If vital structures are involved, it may be more appropriate to preserve function by performing partial tumor excision. For quiescent recurrent tumors, observation is appropriate management, but if further treatment is required, reexcision or radiotherapy may be tried."
"The experience of the Charity Hospital surgeons in dealing with desmoid tumors is examined retrospectively over a 30-year period. Sixteen cases are presented. A 33 per cent rate of recurrence was noted despite excisions with margins free of tumor in each instance. In accordance with chi-square analysis, unequivocal statistical significance is given to the fact that women who have been pregnant are more likely to have abdominal than extraabdominal desmoid tumors. It was also found to be significant that parous women in whom desmoids develop are more likely to have the tumor within 10 years of their last pregnancy."
"A primary intrascrotal mass clinically mimicking a testicular tumor was found to be a desmoid tumor originating from the spermatic cord. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a paratesticular desmoid tumor."
"Most soft-tissue masses and tumors of various etiologies and histologies have high signal intensity on T2-weighted pulse sequences (long T2). Of 47 soft-tissue masses, seven had a low signal (short T2) on T2-weighted pulse sequences. All seven masses were tumors, and histologic review showed that their composition differed from that of the other 40 lesions with a long T2 in that the seven masses were relatively acellular and had more collagen. The tumors with a short T2 included one malignant and six benign soft-tissue tumors. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma and aggressive fibromatosis showed paradoxical signal intensities in that they showed both long and short T2. All of the tumors with low signal intensity on T2-weighted images had significant fibrous elements and marked hypocellularity. This study suggests that the less commonly encountered short T2 may be seen in both benign and malignant soft-tissue lesions. A part of the explanation for the low signal on T2-weighted sequences appears to be the relative acellularity and abundant collagen of these tumors in comparison with those that have the same histologic diagnoses but show a high signal. The histologic composition of the tumor rather than the histologic diagnosis appears to influence the MR signal on T2-weighted sequences."
"Since the diagnosis of soft tissue tumors is often difficult, neurofilament proteins were analyzed to contribute to the diagnosis for neurogenic tumors. Neurofilaments are composed of three polypeptides which generally are in the range of 200,000, 160,000 and 68,000 daltons; these are components of the axonal flow. Materials of the neurogenic tumors were neurinoma, neurofibroma and malignant schwannoma. Control materials were human sciatic nerve, human blood, desmoid tumor, leiomyoma and lipoma. For biochemical analysis, 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and two dimensional electrophoresis (sodium dodecyl sulfate PAGE and isoelectric focusing) were used. For the morphological study, H.E. stain, Bodian stain, luxol fast blue stain and electron microscope were employed. In this study, observation of bands of neurofilaments in the neurogenic tumors, the concentrated band of collagen in desmoid tumor and the band of actin in leiomyoma were possible. This method of analysis thus can be used as supplements for differential diagnosis of soft tissue tumors."
"genetic factors, sex-linked factors, hormonal factors, numerous growth factors, and certain viruses, especially retroviruses. Certain fibromatoses in children are commonly self-limited and need only be monitored carefully as the process regresses. Aggressive fibromatosis, on the other hand, can prove fatal if the lesion is not completely resected with a wide margin and, occasionally, the process may become frankly malignant, with metastases. The standard triad of excisional surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy has been used to treat frankly malignant fibrous tumors with variable results."

"A case of desmoid fibroma of anterior abdominal wall, an exceptional benign tumor, is reported. Based on results of CT scan imaging of this lesion, differential diagnosis of other expansive processes of abdominal wall are discussed. This benign tumor is a potentially serious lesion due to its infiltrating character and the high incidence of recurrence. The need for total surgical excision is emphasized."
We describe the CT appearance of aggressive fibromatosis that presented as a posterior mediastinal mass on chest radiography.

"Among infantile fibromatosis, isolated intra-abdominal forms are the most unusual. The authors report two cases, a hepatic fibromatosis in an eleven year old girl, and a desmoid tumor located in the jejunal mesentery in a ten month old infant. Pre-operative diagnosis is very difficult and histologic findings show a benign fibroblastic proliferation that tends to infiltrate surrounding tissues and often recur after surgical excision."
"no recidive occurred. The histological picture of this rare bone tumor (76 similar cases were reported in the literature) is identical both with aggressive fibromatosis and with the desmoid tumor. It contains areas with abundant collagen fibers and densely packed areas composed of fibrocytes, fibroblasts as well as myofibroblasts. Myofilaments have been detected by electron microscopy in the latter cell type."
"Six patients with inoperable desmoid tumors have been treated by preoperative chemotherapy. In all six cases objective response occurred and allowed conservative surgery. Objective responses included tumor softening (6/6), releasing of articular motion previously limited (3/3), and tumor size' decreasing (2/6). Few histologic modifications were seen. Such data advocates for preoperative chemotherapy in desmoid tumor when large and threatening the limb or the life of the patient."
"Fibrous dysplasia (20%), metastases (16%) and chondrosarcoma (11%) are the most common bone tumors of the chest wall. Except lipoma, primary lesions of the soft tissue of the chest occur rarely as well. The Askin- and Abrikosoff tumor, elastofibroma dorsi and desmoid can be seen as typical exceptions. With respect to the histogenetic classification of undifferentiated sarcomas and thoracic metastases (f.e. prostatic carcinomas or mesotheliomas) an intimate cooperation of surgeons and pathologists as well as modern immunohistochemical investigations are required."
"Solitary congenital or infantile (desmoid-type) fibromatosis is a benign, but potentially locally aggressive lesion that is best treated by wide local excision. It has been confused with congenital fibrosarcoma and other soft-tissue malignant tumors. To our knowledge, ossification has not been reported previously in this lesion. A case of ossifying solitary congenital fibromatosis is presented with a discussion of its differential diagnosis and histologic distinction from other soft-tissue lesions, including soft-tissue and parosteal osteosarcoma."
"Distinguishing superficial plantar fibromatosis from deep fibromatosis of the plantar aspect of the foot is difficult both clinically and histologically. An illustrative case is presented. Clinical factors suggestive of aggressive fibromatosis include presentation at an age younger than 20 years, tumor dimension exceeding 3 cm (without prior surgical excision), and multicentric occurrence in the affected limb. On histological review, the absence of nodule formation favors the diagnosis of deep aggressive fibromatosis."
A fist-sized tumour was seen in a Caesarean section scar of a 28-year old pregnant Turkish woman who had been operated on three years previously. The tumour was excised during Caesarean section and diagnosed as desmoid tumour. Etiology and pathogenesis of these rare soft tissue tumours are discussed and the literature reviewed.
"Soft tissue sarcomas are uncommon malignancies, less than 10% of which arise on the distal upper extremities. Consequently, experience with treatments which preserve both the limb and its function is lacking for tumors in this region. Sixteen patients with sarcomas arising in the hand and wrist and one with an aggressive desmoid tumor were treated by combined modality therapy at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Two patients had wide resections for multiple recurrent lesions, 5 had excisional biopsies, and 9 had incomplete excisions to preserve anatomic structures of the hand. One patient refused an amputation and had no surgery. Sarcoma patients were given postoperative radiation with a dose range of 50.2 to 69 Gy (median 68 Gy). The desmoid tumor received 44 Gy. A shrinking field technique with customized castings and cerrobend blocks was used to assure precision and minimize treatment volumes. Chemotherapy was reserved for metastatic disease. Local control was achieved in 14 patients who received combined modality treatment (87%), with a follow-up 1-12 years (median 33 months). Two of the three patients with local failures subsequently obtained a local control after salvage surgery and radiation. Four patients developed metastases, one with epitrochlear lymph node metastases was salvaged by amputation, the others died with lung disease 17, 37, and 111 months after treatment. Functional integrity of the limb was primarily dependent on the extent of surgical resection required. Among 12 patients with local and distant control, one patient (who had multiple wide resections of an extensive desmoid tumor preceding irradiation) lost over 50% use of her limb, but no patients required amputation for edema or pain control. Ten of the 12 patients with local and distant control had less than a 25% decrement in limb function and had no pain or edema associated with normal use of their hand. We conclude that for selected patients with sarcomas of the distal upper extremity, combined modality therapy consisting of conservative resection and careful radiation therapy is a viable alternative to amputation."
"Aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid, desmoid tumour) resembles, in its infiltrating and destructive growth, a fibrosarcoma, but does not metastasize. Because of its high recurrence rate, the tumour remains a surgical problem. Various imaging methods were evaluated retrospectively in 23 patients with histologically confirmed aggressive fibromatosis. Conventional radiological procedures are poor at demonstrating the extent and type of tumour. Modern tomographic methods are more able to determine the size of the lesion and a combination of angiography and CT can frequently provide a definite diagnosis."
A case of desmoid tumor in the abdominal wall as a cause of malfunction of a cerebrospinal fluid shunt is presented. The desmoid tumor arose from the reactive fibrose tissue formed around the silastic distal tubing and caused the catheter to become disconnected from the reservoir.
"Desmoid tumors are rare nonencapsulated benign lesions that invade the musculoaponeurotic tissues of the body. Such tumors infiltrate insidiously, and attempts to remove them frequently fail, usually leaving residual tumor. The use of adjuvant radiotherapy to decrease the recurrence rate in partially resected extra-abdominal desmoids has been reported by several authors. The role of irradiation in the management of desmoid tumors is illustrated in a case that combined surgery, intraoperative radiotherapy, and postoperative external beam radiotherapy in the management of this lesion."
"Adult soft tissue sarcomas of the head and neck are so rare that an accurate diagnosis and appropriate therapy are frequently delayed. A retrospective study of such patients seen at the University of Illinois over the last 15 years has helped to better characterize this disease entity. Patients with sarcoma of the neck, the most common anatomic location (37 per cent), had the highest 5-year disease-free survival rate (67 per cent). Fibrosarcoma was the most common histologic type (25 per cent). Aggressive fibromatosis patients experienced the longest mean survival time (93 months). The disease-free 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year survival rates were found to be 68, 54, and 28 per cent, respectively. Wide excision was the treatment of choice, with adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or both, used in selected patients. The sarcomas of all long-term survivors were either well-differentiated or 5.0 cm or less in diameter. It is evident that aggressive therapy of adult head and neck sarcomas can provide good long-term results."
"The management of a massive abdominal wall desmoid tumor in a young woman with Gardner's syndrome is discussed. Treatment options included primary radiation, subtotal excision with radiation, primary chemotherapy, or radical resection with abdominal wall reconstruction. The advantages and disadvantages of the various treatment options are discussed, and the technique of resection and reconstruction is explained."

"Two patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and indolent forms of soft-tissue sarcomas (extraosseous osteogenic sarcoma and desmoid tumor) are presented. The literature is reviewed regarding these tumors, which have not previously been recognized in association with IBD. Despite the well-established relationship between IBD and neoplasms of epithelial and lymphoreticular origin, there have been limited data in this context pertaining to mesenchymal tumors. Two preceding reports have described the coexistence of IBD with another form of soft tissue sarcoma (Kaposi's sarcoma). Given that this relationship has now been observed in four cases, the possibility that soft-tissue sarcoma and IBD do not coexist fortuitously must be considered. This suggestion is raised in light of the rare incidence of these disorders, the limited understanding of factors governing their expression, and the known association of IBD with other forms of neoplasia."

"From 1977 to 1982, fourteen patients with desmoid tumors underwent surgery and brachytherapy. Surgery ranged from biopsy to complete or partial excision of the tumor. Most of these patients had locally advanced tumor or positive margins. A high recurrence rate is expected in such a group if treated by surgery alone. In twelve out of fourteen patients the treatment was considered curative when all disease sites could be encompassed. In the remaining two patients the treatment was considered palliative because the tumor encroaching on to the spinal cord was left untreated. Ten out of twelve curatively treated patients have remained free of recurrence at a minimum of 2 year follow-up. Five of them were followed from 4-6 years. In the palliatively treated group, one patient is alive with active disease at 18 months. Three patients developed complications with wound healing. This experience suggests that surgery and brachytherapy treatment for desmoid tumor results in higher local control than expected from surgery alone in this selected group of patients."
"Clinical and experimental evidence suggests a role for estrogen in the natural history of desmoid tumors (DT). Antiestrogen (tamoxifen) has been used empirically in some patients with significant tumor regression. To further investigate the mechanism of hormonal influence on desmoid tumors we initially characterized the cytosol estrogen receptor (ER) and antiestrogen binding sites (AEBS) in microsomal fractions of 15 cases of DT. Biopsy specimens were obtained from nine female and six male patients. ER assay was determined in cytosol (105,000 g) and the AEBS was detected in the microsomal fraction (7000 g for 20 min) by a DCC assay technique. ER was present in 33% of DT assayed (5/15), with equal incidence in males and females. Receptor content in female patients was higher than in male patients (26.52 +/- 16 vs 10.82 +/- 8.32 fmol/mg protein). Dissociation constant (Kd) range (0.44-3.97 nM) was well within the values seen in other estrogen target tissues. The AEBS were detected in 79% of the cases. The mean binding value was 236.7 +/- 170.2 fmol/mg protein. Kd values were between 0.39 and 5.97 nM. ER settled predominantly in the 4S region and AEBS settled in the 5-5.5S region in a 5-20% sucrose gradient. AEBS was detected in seven patients with negative ER. No correlation between ER and AEBS contents was observed. Competition studies revealed minimal binding with either DEX, DHT, R5020, and R1881, but partial binding with tamoxifen in cytosol and estradiol in microsomal fractions. ER and AEBS assays may be of prognostic significance in the natural history of these tumors."
"Aggressive fibromatoses which may develop either in soft tissue or in the bone present considerable problems for the pathologist trying to establish a diagnosis as well as for the radiologist and surgeon. In radiographs, a destruction of the soft and osseous tissue is seen which suggests a malignant tumor. Histologically a monomorphic connective tissue prevails in the biopsy showing no essential signs of malignancy. Under pathoanatomical aspects often a benign proliferation of the connective tissue is assumed. Surgically the tumor may either be removed in a too radical and mutilating way, or the excision may remain incomplete. Two cases of desmoplastic bone fibroma (aggressive fibromatosis in the ulna and in the sacrum) are described in which the complete tumor removal led to healing, whereas the incomplete excision of the tumor resulted in recurrences. Aggressive fibromatosis represents a semimalignant tumor which has a locally destructive and invasive growth tendency but does not metastasize. The various fibromatoses are defined with regard to their biological growth tendency and the therapeutic consequences are discussed."
"We studied 25 patients under 15 years of age with desmoid fibromatosis (DF). There were 15 boys and 10 girls; 13 were under seven years of age and 12 were above. Histologically, DF was identical to DF in adult patients, except for a higher mitotic rate in children's tumors. The tumors were located on the head and neck (8), upper (7) or lower (6) extremities, or the trunk (4). Patients with head and neck DF received preoperative adriamycin and 5-(dimethyltriazeno) imidazole-4-carboxamide or a combination of vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide. In seven patients, tumor reduction began to occur during chemotherapy, while in one patient, there was no response at all. Five patients underwent conservative resections of their residual tumors, and in two patients, all tumor disappeared necessitating no additional surgery. Follow-up in these patients indicates that 6 have no evidence of disease, 1 is alive with recurrent disease, and 1 is lost to follow-up. Surgery was the primary modality of treatment for the trunk and extremity lesions. Twelve patients had no evidence of disease from 2 months to 25 years and 5 months, two died from complications of chemotherapy, and three were lost to follow-up. Our experience agrees with that of other investigators that DF is best managed surgically. However, preoperative chemotherapy should be strongly considered for patients with tumors occurring in the head and neck areas."

"A young 15 year old girl presented with a voluminous desmoid tumor of the calf. Three attempts to excise the tumor were only partially successful because of the risk of vascular and nerve damage, and excision was incomplete on each occasion. These tactics appeared to be justified, however, since the tumor had little functional effects and appeared to become stable at the last examination. The tactical surgical problems are discussed, the benign nature of the tumor imposing conservative surgery which is often incomplete, although in certain cases the operation can be combined with a recovery arterial shunt. The various etiopathogenic elements of these tumors are described."
"A fibromatosis located primarily in the sphenoid, with secondary invasion of the maxilla, orbit, and subtemporal region, was extirpated by means of a combined craniofacial approach."
"A follow-up study of 53 patients with extra-abdominal desmoid tumor is presented. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy seemed to be valuable in the differentiation between a desmoid tumor and a truly malignant soft tissue tumor. The angiographic pictures did not differ from those of other soft tissue tumors, but valuable topographic information was obtained from the angiography in the preoperative planning. The overall local recurrence rate was 17/44, and 15 of the recurrences occurred within the first 2 years. Complete removal of the affected muscle or muscle group is recommended. Local control can be achieved by non-ablative surgery even after multiple recurrences. Only one out of 53 patients died of the tumor disease. Radiotherapy can be attempted in extensive tumors, and amputation should be reserved for tumors which have failed to respond to this treatment."
"the juvenile period, the fertile period, the middle-age period and the old-age period. The juvenile desmoid tumor is an extraabdominal tumor found in young girls, the fertile variety is an abdominal tumor found in women, the middle age variety is also overwhelmingly abdominal but the sex ratio approaches equality, whereas in the old age group, both abdominal and extraabdominal tumors are equally frequent and the sex ratio is equal. In all male patients, the growth rate was low. A low growth rate was also recorded in young girls. A growth rate of twice that speed was seen in fertile women and four times that speed in the middle age group. In the old age group, a low growth rate, equal to that of male patients, was a rule. The fertile female patients with desmoid tumor had a significant predisposition to estrogen dominance and deviation from progesterone dominance. The direct relationship of the growth rate to the level of endogenous estrogen in the female patients and the demonstration of significant amounts of estradiol but not progesterone receptors in the tumor cytosol further suggest that the growth rate of desmoid tumor is regulated by steroid sex hormones. A significant number of patients with an abdominal desmoid tumor had a history of surgical trauma in the region of subsequent tumor growth. A very high number of the patients demonstrated multiple minor malformations of the bony skeleton. An increased frequency of these malformations was also recorded in the families of the patients and the distribution of the malformations among the family members was compatible with an autosomally dominant pattern of inheritance. After operation, the frequency of recurrence was not statistically different, regardless of whether the tumor was completely removed or not. A combination of operation and radiotherapy did not reduce the frequency of recurrences; in fact, it doubled it.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

"Two cases of aggressive fibromatosis are described, one with tricentric origin and with the first tumor originating in the hand, the other with malignant transformation into a myxoid fibrosarcoma, grade III. The primary treatment of aggressive fibromatosis should be wide excision, and the follow-up should be long, taking into account the possibility of multicentricity and the risk of malignant transformation."
"We report a case of congenital multiple fibromatosis (infantile myofibromatosis) showing the typical spindle-cellular proliferation with prominent vascularity on light microscopical observations. Electron microscopy showed the abundance of fibroblasts with conspicuous collagen and reticulin fibers together with numerous cells sharing the characteristics of both fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells (myofibroblasts). Neither visceral involvement nor ossification has been detected during the 4-year-long follow-up period. However, the clinical course has shown a slow, continuous, protracted though destructive proliferation of subcutaneous myofibroblastic nodules. These findings are contrasted with previous reports that claimed that the presence of myofibroblasts indicates benign behavior and results in the regression of fibromatous lesions."

"Therapeutic tactics and control regime for aggressive fibromatosis are described in this paper, with reference being made to the authors' own patients. Locally delimited, wide excision without supporting radiotherapy is recommended also for recurrent cases. Anti-oestrogenic treatment has now been adopted to cope with locally delimited inoperability. The polytopic, usually congenital form of aggressive fibromatosis must be interpreted as a particularly unfavourable course with potential malignancy. Sonography so far has proved to be a suitable approach to pre-operative and postoperative screening."
"A cohort study of 142 male Swedish capacitor manufacturing workers was performed. PCB had been used as a dielectricum in power capacitors between 1960 and 1978. Mortality was investigated for the period 1965 to 1982 and cancer incidence from 1965 to 1980. Twenty-one deaths and seven cancers were observed, which was in agreement with the anticipated numbers calculated from national statistics. One person had developed two rare tumors, a slow growing mesenchymal tumor (desmoid) and a malignant lymphoma. The results cannot rule out the possibility of a carcinogenic risk from PCB exposure because of the small size of the cohort and relatively brief follow-up period, but they do not indicate any excess mortality or cancer incidence in this factory so far."
"A case of desmoid tumor arising from the abdominal wall is presented. Although the mass was well demonstrated by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), the typical fibroblastic nature of the tumor was best depicted by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging which also clearly showed the classic origin of the tumor from the anterior abdominal wall musculature. The overall extent of the lesion was also best demonstrated by MR imaging using both transaxial and coronal planes. Spin echo sequences with late echoes were useful in confirming the nature of this lesion."
"From 1969 to 1983, 53 adult patients with head and neck soft tissue sarcomas were evaluated and treated by the Division of Surgical Oncology at the University of Illinois. The most common anatomic location was the neck (36%), and these patients had the highest 5-year disease-free survival rate (67%). Fibrosarcoma was the most common histologic type (26%); patients with aggressive fibromatosis had the longest mean survival time (93 months). The mean overall survival time was 58.7 months, and the disease-free 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year survival rates were 68%, 54%, and 28%, respectively. Wide excision was the treatment of choice, with adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or both, used in selected patients. In all of the long-term survivors, the tumors were either well-differentiated or less than or equal to 5.0 cm in diameter. It is apparent that aggressive therapy of such tumors can provide good long-term results."

"Desmoid tumors are rare tumors of the anterior abdominal wall. They are easily accessible to sonography and computed tomography because of their superficial situation. We must know the signs which can call up this diagnosis, particularly sonographic signs. We report one case with usual radiologic aspects of these tumors."
"The criteria for recommending an operant conditioning program for a patient with chronic pain include definable pain behavior. A thorough investigation of all organic factors that may contribute to pain is usually made prior to such treatment. This report describes a patient with chronic pain and mild cognitive deficits related to a truck accident who insidiously developed an extra-abdominal desmoid tumor. Desmoid tumors, which may develop after trauma, are associated with incidental connective tissue anomalies. They can be initially mistaken for fibrocytic nodules because they have a distribution similar to that in fibromyalgia. This patient's painful tumor was diagnosed while he was participating in a remobilization program. Subsequent resection and irradiation adversely affected rehabilitation goals and reinforced the patient's conviction that all his complaints were organically based."
"localized, in which fibroproliferative lesions occur only in solitary nodules; and progressive, in which fibromatosis occurs throughout the abdominal cavity. RF-affected monkeys often develop a simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (SAIDS) with severe thymic and lymphoid atrophy, chronic enterocolitis, and wasting. Experimental intraperitoneal inoculation with suspensions of RF tissue in two separate experiments resulted in the development of SAIDS in 5 of 16 and RF-SAIDS in 3 of 16 macaques. RF associated with SAIDS appears to be an excellent model for the Kaposi's sarcoma associated with AIDS."

"Fibromatosis of the breast results in aggressive, infiltrative lesions with a propensity for local recurrence. We describe an unusual case of fibromatosis producing a growth resembling carcinoma in a 39-year-old woman. Recognizing this infrequently encountered condition is important to avoid unnecessary radical surgery."
"Aggressive fibromatosis occurred in a father and his son. Both are alive without signs of recurrence 3 and 10 years after below-knee amputation and exarticulation of the hip joint, respectively. When possible, this tumour should be excised radically."
"Fifteen patients with aggressive fibromatosis are presented. The patients ranged in age from one to 64 years, an average of 26 years, and the median time of follow-up study after treatment was ten years (a range of 2.5 to 22.0). Within this period, 60 per cent (nine of 15) of the tumors recurred. In a survey of the literature, when simple excision was compared with wide extirpation, the latter was found significantly superior (p less than 0.01) in terms of limiting a recurrence of the tumor. The results of a pathoanatomic study found that the number of mast cells and the size of the primary tumor could not prognosticate the clinical course. It was concluded that aggressive fibromatosis should be evaluated and treated like a low malignant soft tissue tumor."

The case history of a child with an intrathoracic desmoid tumor is presented. The insidious nature of the tumor's development and its possible relationship to previous surgery are noted. Desmoid tumors are rare in the childhood population and an intrathoracic site as the origin of one has not been reported previously.
"Thirteen patients with aggressive fibromatosis underwent skeletal scintigraphy and computed tomography as part of their preoperative staging. Bone involvement was visible on plain radiographs of three patients. For the other 10 patients, the presence or absence of bone involvement was shown best by computed tomography (CT) in five instances, and best by scintigraphy only once. The two studies were equally useful four times. Although skeletal scintigraphy has previously been found to be very accurate for the evaluation of bone involvement by soft tissue sarcomas, it was less useful in these patients with aggressive fibromatosis."
"Desmoid tumor in the maxillary sinus is a rare condition. The present case occurred in a 37-year-old male complaining of left nasal obstruction and dull pain in the nape of the neck. The clinical picture, pathology, diagnosis and prognosis are discussed and the literature is reviewed."
"Ten cases of desmoid tumor, diagnosed, treated, and followed during the past 11 years, were reviewed and the patients reexamined. Two were up to 3 years, two up to 5 years, and four up to 11 years after excision. The remaining two patients were lost to follow-up. The 10 patients included one male and nine females; six females were of childbearing age and three were postmenopausal. In four females the desmoid tumor was located near various surgical scars. In the one recurrent desmoid it was most probably related to both repeated traumatization of the abdominal wall due to pregnancies and hyperestrogenism. All the surgical margins of resection were microscopically involved by the process. An open liver biopsy, performed simultaneously with the excision of the recurrent desmoid, showed benign nodular hyperplasia compatible with hyperestrogenism. Estrogen and progesterone receptors of this desmoid were negative. In the present series follow-up revealed, in contrast to general agreement, that in spite of incomplete excision, the recurrence rate was low. We suggest that the surgical approach to desmoid tumors could be less radical, except possibly for lesions in patients with multiple causative factors."
"This study was carried out to evaluate in vitro the beneficial effects observed in various aggressive fibromatoses (mediastinal, retroperitoneal, paraneoplastic fibrosis and desmoid tumors) after treatment with progesterone. Primary cultures of fibroblasts were prepared from fetuses of Swiss strain mice. Continuous fibroblast lines LM and Vero were also used. Moreover, cultures of non-fetal human fibroblast from skin and lung were employed. Epithelial tumor cell line HeLa was used as a control. All cultures were incubated with various doses of progesterone at concentrations from 1.4 X 10(-4) to 1.4 X 10(-3) M. Human cells and monolayers of fetal murine fibroblast were submitted to the action of medroxyprogesterone solution at the same concentrations as used for progesterone. Other steroids (estrone, estriol, testosterone and prednisolone) were used at the identical concentrations in the same vehicles. Progesterone affected all lines of fibroblasts studied and destroyed them within either 2-4 or 24-48 h depending on the steroid concentrations used. Medroxyprogesterone had a comparable effect on human cell lines and monolayers of fetal murine fibroblasts provided that the same ratio between the hormone concentration and the time of exposure was maintained. With higher medium concentrations shorter times of incubation were required for the destruction of fibroblast. However, to observe a degree of lysis similar to that elicited by progesterone, it was necessary to use 4 times higher concentrations of medroxyprogesterone. No effect on HeLa epithelial cells was observed nor were the controls affected by the steroids or diluents used at the appropriate concentrations. Results from incubation studies using monolayers of murine fibroblast and 14C-progesterone suggested that the cells were destroyed by the progesterone and not by a bioproduct of its metabolism."
"an irregular, amorphous dystrophic calcification of the collagen fibers and an organized, laminated psammomatous calcification (psammoma bodies). Ultrastructural studies revealed that the dystrophic calcification is a result of direct mineralization of individual collagen fibrils with subsequent coalescence to form large, calcified masses. Psammomatous calcification tended to cluster around areas where the collagen fibers assumed a whorled configuration. It is suggested that the circular orientation of the collagen fibers in some way favors the laminar deposition of hydroxyapitite crystals. The cause of the pathologic calcifications is the presence of extensive amorphous eosinophilic degeneration of the collagen fibers."

"High-dose radiation (in excess of 2500 rads or centiGray) to the head and neck area is reputedly infrequently associated with the emergence of thyroid nodular disease. Thirty-three patients who underwent high-dose radiation and who developed thyroid nodular disease have been described. Radiation was originally administered for hyperthyroidism in 11 patients, postmastectomy in five, oral cancer in three, Hodgkin's disease in three, facial hirsutism in three, hemangioma in three, cancer of the larynx in one, skin cancer in one, desmoid tumor of the neck in one, Ewing's tumor in one, and pituitary tumor in one. Treatment included radioiodine in 11, external radiation in 21, interstitial radiation in one, and combined radiation in one. Associated head and neck neoplasms included four parathyroid tumors, one osteogenic sarcoma of the maxilla, two basal cell cancers of the facial skin, and one parotid gland carcinoma. The study group consisted of five men and 26 women varying in age from 22 to 75 years, with a duration of latency of effect varying from 1.5 to 50 years. Thyroid disease consisted of 21 cancers, six adenomas, four colloid goiters, and two cases of thyroiditis resulting in four deaths caused by cancer, for a 20% mortality rate. Consideration of radiation beam behavior showed that isodose curve, penumbra effect, back scatter, and special field resulted in the thyroid gland receiving a low dose, namely under 2500 rads. Clinical factors such as an overlooked goiter, coincidental carcinoma, error in presumption of dose, and second primary malignancy were also considerations. True biologic radiation oncogenesis may have been seen in our radioiodine-treated group with hyperthyroidism as well as the group with Hodgkin's disease who underwent mantle irradiation. It is apparent that for whatever reason and by whatever means and by whatever mechanism, high-dose radiation to the head and neck area can result in significant thyroid disease, and patients undergoing such radiation should be followed with this in mind and considered for thyroid feeding on a prophylactic basis."
"A case of an extra-abdominal desmoid tumor in a 17-year-old female is reported. At the time of the first examination, the tumor was found to already involve the floor of the mouth, the submandibular region, both sides of the neck, the anterior chest wall and the mediastinum and hence was considered inoperable. The patient was treated by external irradiation and interstitial irradiation (Ir and Au). The therapeutic response was very slow, becoming noticeable 4 months after completion of the therapy and lasting for more than a year. Experience in this case indicates that in order for radiotherapy to prove successful in the treatment of desmoid tumor, it must be administered in relatively high doses. Since desmoid tumors reportedly have the potential for sarcomatous transformation, a long-term follow-up seems to be necessary in the management of patients with this neoplasm. It is considered that inoperable extra-abdominal desmoid tumors are a good indication for radiation therapy."
"Five cases of aggressive fibromatosis of the head and neck area (extra-abdominal desmoids) are presented. The clinical and histological character of local aggressiveness of these tumours is emphasised. Radical surgery, when feasible, is the only satisfactory form of treatment. Excision of as much tumour tissue as preservation of vital structures in the area will permit can also offer worthwhile palliation."
"Tumor scintigraphy, using Tc(V)-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (Tc(V)-DMS) was performed in 58 patients with soft tissue tumors, and the results were compared with that of Ga-67 citrate. Tc(V)-DMS was found to have a sensitivity of 90% for malignant tumors including aggressive fibromatosis compared to that of Ga-67 citrate, which was 56%. However, the specificity of Tc(V)-DMS for these tumors was 71% but with Ga-67 citrate the specificity was 80%. The imaging accuracy in soft tissue tumors with Tc(V)-DMS and Ga-67 citrate was 78% and 71%, respectively. Although the accumulation of Tc(V)-DMS has been detected in some benign soft tissue tumors, the reduced accumulation in inflammatory lesions compared to Ga-67 citrate was recognized, and Tc(V)-DMS could be of great use in the detection of extension or location of malignant soft tissue tumors."

"A case of congenital solitary myofibromatosis occurring in the mandible is presented. Recognition of this entity is of clinical importance as the lesion can be easily confused with juvenile fibromatosis. In contrast to this latter disease which exhibits a locally aggressive growth pattern requiring radical surgery, myofibromatosis consists of well-circumscribed nodules amenable to simple excision. Moreover, myofibromatosis may show spontaneous regression. Histological features permitting the differentiation of myofibromatosis from juvenile fibromatosis are discussed."
"In the first, malignant transformation may be due to radiation therapy and hemipelvectomy could not prevent recurrence. In the second, spontaneous regression of untreated pelvic affection may have occurred. In the third, several resections and amputation of the leg failed to cure congenital infantile fibromatosis."
"The clinical and pathological features of six cases of desmoplastic fibroma of bone are presented. Desmoplastic fibroma is rarely seen as a primary tumour of bone; when it does occur the sites of predilection are the long bones, but other sites such as the scapula and os calcis can be involved. Radiographically the lesion tends to expand the bone from within; it is well-demarcated and lytic, often with a trabeculated soap-bubble appearance. The cellular structure and the morphological arrangement are similar to those of aggressive fibromatosis of soft tissues. Differential diagnosis from malignant spindle-cell lesions of bone is important because the treatment of choice for desmoplastic fibroma of bone is simply excision with a thin layer of healthy tissue."
"Fifteen CT scans of 13 patients who had aggressive fibromatosis were generally accurate in showing the extent of disease, although the CT definition of half or more of the margins of nine lesions was poor. Fibromatosis tumors were typically isodense or slightly hypodense with muscle when no contrast medium was used, and they enhanced to hyperdense with better delineation during infusion of contrast medium. Obliterated intermuscular planes did not always signify disease extension; the relationship to bone was often obscured by beam-hardening artifact; and small blood vessels were often invisible. Arteriograms of seven of eight patients showed some hypervascularity and helped to delineate lesions and vessels that were poorly seen on CT scans. In four instances CT findings were clearer, in two instances arteriographic findings were clearer, and twice the findings were equally clear. Three of six bone scintigrams added accurate information about involvement of adjacent bones. Since fibromatosis can microscopically infiltrate beyond the margins indicated by radiographic studies and even by direct palpation at operation, the surgeon should obtain a wide margin beyond the defined tumor limits."

"Mesenteric desmoid tumors are a recognized sequela of colectomy for polyposis coli of Gardner's type. Relentless growth and recurrence carry a poor prognosis. Recently, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been used to halt the growth of these tumors, presumably by interfering with prostaglandin metabolism. A 36-year-old man presented with small-bowel obstruction secondary to a large, diffuse mesenteric desmoid six years following colectomy and ileoproctostomy. Laparotomy revealed it to be unresectable. Postoperatively, he was started on sulindac (Clinoril) 100 mg twice a day. His obstruction resolved, and he remains well at 11 months. A CT scan shows diminution in the size of the tumor. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents may be an alternative to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in treating mesenteric desmoids."
"This study presents the results of light- and electron-microscopic and enzyme histochemical investigations in ten cases of congenital pseudarthrosis of the lower limb. At the time of surgery, six of the ten patients had not been operated on previously. The characteristic histological feature of the ""sclerotic type"" of congenital pseudarthrosis was a marked fibromatous reaction consisting of cellular connective tissue. The constituent cells were arranged in bundles and had elongated nuclei. The number of nuclei per visual field was considerably higher in pathological specimens than in specimens from the uninvolved leg. In places, the histological appearance resembled somewhat that of palmar fibromatosis (Dupuytren's disease). Destruction and absorption of bone were always found. Electron-microscopic analysis showed that a large number of the cells represented myofibroblasts. These findings were supported by the positive reaction of the cells for the enzyme diaminopeptidase IV, a marker enzyme for myofibroblasts [30]. As yet it is not possible to decide whether the constriction of the pseudarthritic bone is caused by a thickened myofibroblast-containing periosteum [40] or by the aggressive osteolytic component of the fibromatosis [12, 19, 41]. Furthermore, the relationship of congenital pseudarthrosis to fibrous dysplasia of bone is still unknown. Obviously, there are histological similarities between the two diseases, including the presence of osteolytic fibrous tissue in the medullary cavity and C-shaped bone trabeculae. However, the pattern of bone involvement and prognosis are different. Irrespective of the type of congenital pseudarthrosis, focal angiomatous hyperplasia was noted in some cases. This proliferation of blood vessels is most likely a reactive change.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

"We analyzed the results of treatment in 89 cases of desmoid tumor (DT) with a follow-up period of 9.3 +/- 5.9 years. After surgical removal, the frequency of recurrence was equal, regardless of whether a complete removal of the tumor was obtained or not. After combined operation and radiotherapy, recurrence was higher. A higher frequency of recurrences was observed in extraabdominal (45%) v abdominal (10%) DTs. Recurrence was particularly high in the juvenile variety (70%), and low in the DTs of fertile women (11%). If a recurrence followed the first operation, multiple recurrences were the rule. Spontaneous regression was observed in 4% of the cases. The results emphasize that the basic biologic characteristics of this rare neoplasm have a greater impact on the results than the operation itself. A simple excision at the primary operation is recommended."
"Desmoid tumors are benign neoplasms, arising from musculoaponeurotic tissues, which tend to be locally infiltrative, resulting in a high rate of local recurrence following surgical resection. Nineteen patients with desmoid tumors underwent radiation therapy at the University of California, San Francisco, between 1970 and 1980. Fifteen patients were referred with local recurrence following one or more surgical resections. Three patients were referred for initial radiation therapy with unresectable tumors, and one patient received planned postoperative irradiation following subtotal tumor resection. At the time of treatment, 8 patients had nonresectable disease measuring greater than 10 cm. Five patients had residual tumor masses measuring 4 to 6 cm, and six had only microscopic disease following resection. The majority of patients were treated to a tumor dose of 50-55 Gy at 1.6 to 1.8 Gy per fraction. With a median follow-up of 8 years, 13 patients remained free of recurrent disease following radiation therapy. The 5 year relapse free survival was 72% with 10 patients continuing to be free of disease 5 to 11 years following therapy. Local control was not related to the amount of disease present at the time of treatment. Of the 6 patients who developed recurrent disease, only 1 patient had a true in-field recurrence. Four patients recurred at the margin of the radiation field 1 to 5 years following therapy. Of these four patients, 3 were successfully salvaged while 1 died as a result of tumor extension into a major vessel. One patient with an extensive mesenteric mass did not respond to therapy and died 1 month post irradiation. The patient with the in-field recurrence and 1 patient with a marginal recurrence were successfully treated with combination chemotherapy. Moderate dose radiation therapy to desmoid tumors can result in lasting local control when surgical resection is not possible. Post operative radiation can improve the rate of local control for patients with a high risk of recurrence. As desmoid tumors tend to be locally infiltrative, fields must be very generous to prevent marginal recurrence. Systemic chemotherapy offers an alternative to ablative surgery in the event of local failure following radiation therapy."
The literature on multifocal aggressive fibromatosis is reviewed and the fifth case recorded is reported. It conforms with the histopathological criteria for aggressive fibromatosis. Conservative local excision and radiotherapy have controlled the disease with preservation of a functioning limb.
"The authors report 2 cases of sciatica resulting from nervous compression by a desmoid tumour in women aged 33 and 27 years. In each case, careful exeresis did not prevent recurrence as shown by tomodensitometry. Eight other well-documented cases were found in the literature. The desmoid tumour penetrates the buttock and thigh muscles and presses the sciatic nerve. The patients often suffer from previous and persistent sciatica which can combine with hip restriction. The responsible tumour made up of abundant bundles of collagenous fibers, a small number of fusiform cells without mitosis or atypics and on the periphery degenerative and dissociated muscle fibers is usually discovered late. Tomodensitometry is the best means of detection, evaluation of the extent, adhesions and recurrence during the observation period. Treatment is usually surgical and success depends on the quality of the exeresis. Other methods, corticoid, anti-oestrogen and radiotherapy, sometimes effective in desmoid tumours of the abdominal wall, do not prevent recurrence in the buttocks or thighs which are of sciatic derivation."

The results of treatment of desmoid tumor patients with nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs alone or in combination with tamoxifen are described. Tumor growth was inhibited in six of seven patients. Nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs administered along with 5-fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide and other inhibitors of T-suppressor cells were used to treat nine patients with metastatic carcinoma of the stomach. Survival of these patients was extended so that after 12 months minimal follow-up the majority are well. A prospective controlled clinical trial is indicated.
Three children with aggressive fibromatosis are presented and the value of computed tomography in defining the extent of the lesions and for follow-up and treatment planning is discussed. Aggressive fibromatosis is a nonmetastasizing fibrous lesion with a propensity for local invasion and recurrence after surgery. The lesions usually have a poorly defined margin on computed tomography and the attenuation coefficient is less than that of muscle with poor enhancement following intravenous administration of contrast material.

"A retrospective study was done of 132 patients with desmoid fibromatosis (fibrosarcoma grade I desmoid type [FIDT]). Eight patients with tumor in the extremities demonstrated abnormalities in the adjacent bones. Bone erosion and a ""frondlike"" periosteal reaction were the radiological patterns identified. A local recurrence occurred in 5 of the 8 patients, indicating the locally aggressive behavior of this tumor."

"Nine cases of fibromatosis occurring in or near the oral cavity are presented here. They are classified as nodular fasciitis (3 cases), aggressive infantile fibromatosis (2 cases), fibrosing myositis (1 case) and fibromatosis (1 case). Of the 5 cases of nodular fasciitis, 3 occurred from the fascia of the masticatory muscle and 2 from the submucous fascia of the palate and tongue. The aggressive infantile fibromatosis showed a prominent infiltrating growth and an alarming histologic appearance. One of the 2 cases showed a recurrence, but the postoperative course of both cases was uneventful for 13 years and 10 years, respectively. The fibrosing myositis is an unusual fibromatosis of the muscle, which arose within the tongue muscle. The lesion was benign and can be cured by conservative surgery."
"An EEG has been recorded during surgery for a cervico-mediastinal desmoid fibroma in a 3-year-old child. Soon after anesthetic induction a bronchospasm occurred, followed by major respiratory difficulties. During more than 3 h, hypercapnia reaching 15-24 kpa was noted without hypoxia. Meanwhile the EEG recording was inactive. The respiratory difficulties subsided only with the surgical liberation of the trachea. As the hypercapnia decreased, the EEG began to show ""burst suppressive"" activity. Progressively the tracing was more and more continuous with slow waves until complete recovery. The following day the EEG was quite normal. The mechanisms of these EEG features are discussed with regards to anesthetic drugs and to brain hypercapnic edema."

Our experience with the use of systemic chemotherapy in the management of locally aggressive head and neck tumors in the pediatric age group (desmoid fibromatosis and nasopharyngeal angiofibroma) is presented. Objective decreases in the size of tumors was found in all patients with desmoid fibromatosis was treated with chemotherapy before definitive surgical resection was performed. The changes noticed on examination correlated with the histologic and radiologic findings. Two patients with recurrent juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas showed striking therapeutic improvement in their residual tumor mass as witnessed by radiographic studies and biopsies. Toxicity and side effects of the treatment are discussed.

"We have carefully examined four patients with desmoid tumor (DT) and their 31 relatives. In three of four cases, biopsies of the DT demonstrated low yet significant amounts of estrogen but not progesterone receptors in the tumor cytosol. In the fourth case, where the receptors were not demonstrable, the affected patient was a menopausal woman and the receptors may have been blocked by endogenous estrogen. Fourteen of their 31 relatives demonstrated multiple minor bone malformations in x-ray screening of the skeleton. The inheritance of these malformations was compatible with an autosomal dominant trait with variable penetrance. These findings are compatible with our suggestion that the basic underlying cause for DT is an inherited defect in growth regulation of the connective tissue. When a trauma is superimposed on such an individual, a DT may result. The growth of the tumor is, however, controlled primarily by sex hormones, estrogen predominance over progesterone being inducive to tumor growth."
"Eighty histologically verified cases of the desmoid tumor (DT) have been analyzed with regard to factors possibly contributing to the etiology and/or growth behavior of this uncommon neoplasm. Considering the four statistical age components, the ""fertile"" female and ""menopausal"" varieties of the DT grew distinctly faster (0.1 less than P greater than 0.05 and less than 0.05), and the female ""juvenile"" variety distinctly slower (0.1 less than P greater than 0.05) than the male DTs. In a visual estimate, the fertile female patients had a significant (P less than 0.01) predisposition to estrogen predominance, while fewer patients than expected displayed progesterone predominance or were at balance (P = NS and less than 0.01, respectively). Thirty-two per cent of the patients with an abdominal DT had been previously operated in the region of subsequent tumor growth. Significantly more pregnancies were observed in patients with abdominal DT than with extra-abdominal DT (P less than 0.05). On only one occasion did sigmoideoscopy reveal colonic polyposis (Gardner's syndrome). The most striking observation was, however, that up to 80% of the affected patients (compared with less than 5% in the normal control population, P less than 0.05) had multiple minor bone anomalies demonstrable by x-ray screening of the mandible, chest, and long bones. We suggest that a generalized (inherited or mutant) defect in growth regulation of connective tissue is the most important underlying cause for the DT. However, the other factors, including hormonal effects, trauma, and pregnancy contribute to the growth behavior of the tumor."
"""juvenile"" DT, a predominantly extra-abdominal desmoid tumor of the female sex; ""fertile"" DT, a nearly exclusively abdominal DT of fertile females; ""menopausal"" DT, a predominantly abdominal tumor where the sex ratio approaches one:one; and ""senescent"" DT, where abdominal and extra-abdominal varieties are equally frequently encountered and where the sex ratio of the affected patients is one:one."
"Of the six types of congenital pseudarthrosis, Type II is the most common and lends to poorest prognosis. The basic pathology is an aggressive osteolytic fibromatosis. Failures in these patients are due to recurrence of the osteolytic fibromatosis, which can remove living bone or a dead bone graft. Type III cases have a better prognosis. The gross pathology is a bone cyst, and the microscopic findings resemble fibrous dysplasia. After surgical treatment, generally, the older the child the better the prognosis. Recurrences are rare after skeletal maturity."
"(1) 1966-1978, during which almost all tumors were treated by radical buttectomy with limb preservation, often in conjunction with radiation therapy, and (2) 1934-1966, as previously reported by Wanebo et al, in which treatment by hemipelvectomy was frequently offered. Desmoid tumors were excluded. The five-year survival rates after curative treatment were almost identical, 40% vs 39%, respectively. Distant metastases were the main cause of death. Very high local recurrence rates were recorded after therapy: 45% vs 39% for the respective periods. Local recurrences seemed prone to occur with large, deeply fixed sarcomas, particularly when inadequate or no radiation therapy had been utilized. These observations point to the need for innovative methods to prevent local tumor recurrence and a trial of adjuvant chemotherapy if long-term cure with limb preservation is to be achieved."

"The distinction at the level of light microscopy between aggressive fibromatosis and low-grade malignancies with fibroblastic features may be difficult. An electron microscopic study of four cases of aggressive fibromatosis of the mandibular soft tissue was undertaken to determine whether any ultrastructural characteristics could be identified that would aid in a more uniform distinction between these lesions. The pertinent findings include the identification of cells of fibroblastic derivation showing a range of organelle-poor to organelle-rich features, cytoplasmic microfibrils, and dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum profiles. These features are discussed in the light of previously published findings of other forms of aggressive fibromatosis and closely related lesions. The study reaffirms that although electron microscopy may be useful in confirming the cell of origin in these lesions, the accurate diagnosis of fibrous tumors still rests with the proper correlation of clinical and light microscopic features. Clinical follow-up of the cases supports both the diagnosis of aggressive fibromatosis and the recommended treatment of adequate local excision."
"Sonographic and computed-tomographic (CT) findings in two patients with mesenteric desmoid tumors are reviewed. On ultrasound scans, mesenteric desmoids appear as well-circumscribed masses with scattered dense high-level echoes which correspond to mesenteric fat and vessels on the CT scan. Although these tumors appear well marginated on both ultrasound and CT scans, the pathologic examination shows microscopic invasion at the tumor margin in most cases. Differentiation from other mesenteric masses is discussed."

"A case of cartilage analogue of fibromatosis (CAF) adjacent and inferior to the mandible of a 48-year-old man is reported. CAF is a term currently used by some authors to replace the term juvenile aponeurotic fibroma. Histologically, this apparent variant of fibromatosis is made up of a richly cellular fibroblastic stroma with foci of fibrocartilage or benign chondroid differentiation. Although the CAF may be locally aggressive, malignant behavior has not been reported, and these neoplasms may be adequately managed by conservative surgery. This case appears to be the first case of CAF from paraoral region; however, care examination of previous reports and cases of fibromatosis may indicate that this entity may be more common that the literature suggests."

"Fibromatosis is a heterogenous group of soft tissue neoplasias, only some forms of which occur in the head and neck region. In the pathological classification it takes place between the fibroma and fibrosarcoma. With nodular fasciitis, it's subspecies myositis proliferans and aggressive fibromatosis exist differential diagnostic difficulties, especially as it's difficult to exclude fibrosarcoma. The benign myositis proliferans gives an impression of a malignant process by it's rapid proliferation, cell-polymorphia and high mitotic activity. The monomorphous histological picture and the slower proliferation of the aggressive fibromatosis, however can simulate a benign tumor, although thought to be semimalignant. 3-case-reports point out these characteristics. Complete excision is the therapy advised for all fibromatosis. In aggressive fibromatosis a large enough healthy area is the best condition to prevent recidives."
"Surgery of soft tissue sarcomas in children has been modified by the introduction of multidisciplinary treatment so that major amputation and exenterations are now rare in the management of these tumors in children. Surgery must still be well planned for total removal of the tumor with preservation of limbs and, in most instances, the function of pelvic organs. The commonest soft tissue sarcomas in children are embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), fibrosarcoma, and synovial sarcoma. Treatment of embryonal RMS can now achieve a 2-year survival of 80% at all sites. Surgery and irradiation are used to control the primary tumor and multidrug chemotherapy to control metastases or prevent dissemination of localized tumor. Fibrosarcoma in children, usually a low-grade, extra-abdominal desmoid lesion, does not respond to radiation treatment or chemotherapy, and management is by surgery alone. It shows a marked tendency to local recurrence, and multiple local resections may be necessary for cure. Ninety percent of the children with this tumor can be salvaged by surgery and careful follow-up. The management of synovial sarcoma is surgical and similar to that of RMS. Although not radiosensitive as is RMS, this tumor has responded well to multidisciplinary treatment. Adequate resection is now followed by a chemotherapy protocol similar to that used in osteogenic sarcoma. The smaller numbers of these tumors and their varied natural history make evaluation of treatment difficult. Other soft tissue sarcomas seen with extreme rarity in children are liposarcoma, angiosarcoma, and neurosarcoma. These tumors are treated with the same protocol as that of RMS."
"A case of post-traumatic desmoid tumor of the mandible is reported in a 4-year old girl. This tumor was considered typical clinically and by light microscopy. Four years later, the patient was symptomless, without evidence of recurrence. Histoenzymology showed a high level of leucine aminopeptidase activity. On electron microscopy, a part from a few primitive mesenchymal cells, abnormal fibroblasts represented the principal cellular component. These cells showed evidence of intracytoplasmic collagen fibers synthesis and of myoid differentiation (numerous filaments and endocytosis vacuoles). Myofibroblasts, with a microfibrillary network showing areas of dense osmiophilic condensation in the vicinity of cell membrane were also present. This atypical ultrastructural feature suggests, in this case, the non-neoplastic nature of this lesion. It seems to reflect an abnormal reaction to a traumatic aggression, characterized by proliferation of myofibroblasts (which normally disappear in the late stages of healing) and to have, thus, the signification of pathologic scar."
"Report of a case of aggressive musculo-aponeurotic fibromatosis in a 14-year-old girl with transformation into fibrosarcoma, 10 years later. The tumoral mass initiated its growth in the nuchal region but finally invaded both the cervical and the right retroscapular region. Evidence for muscular, osseous and neurological invasion and destruction was found. The tumor could be controlled neither by surgery, nor by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This case report is studied in the light of cases reported in the literature."
"Sixteen cases of mandibular tumors or paramandibular soft tissue tumors with mandibular involvement are reported. These include such rare mandibular tumors or tumor-like conditions as melanotic progonoma, intraosseous haematoma secondary to von Willebrand's disease, post-irradiation osteosarcoma, monostotic eosinophilic granuloma, aneurysmal bone cyst and osseous hemangiopericytoma. Three cases of cherubism, one of fibrous dysplasia or aggressive fibromatosis and one of central giant cell reparative granuloma are also reported. The soft tissue tumors comprise round cell sarcoma, parotid adeno-carcinoma with generalised metastases, embryonal rhabdo-myo-sarcoma, neuro-fibro-sarcoma and congenital cystic hygroma. In all the cases the disease was well advanced when the patient presented for X-ray examination. The specific X-ray diagnosis of mandibular and paramandibular tumors in childhood is more difficult than that of similar tumors in other parts of the body."
?
"Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors are known to be associated with familial polyposis coli, but have not been previously described in association with carcinoma of the sigmoid colon. This is a case report of a patient with intra-abdominal desmoid tumor associated with carcinoma of the sigmoid colon which manifested as a small-bowel obstruction. This appears to be the first case of its kind reported."
?
"Abdominal wall desmoid tumor is a rare, locally invasive proliferation of mature fibrous tissue which does not metastasize. It usually presents as an asymptomatic mass, and occurs most frequently in young women after childbirth. All three of our patients showed an echo-free mass deep in the abdominal wall with poor sonic transmission. Ultrasound cannot only accurately localize the lesion, but allows the radiologist to suggest the correct diagnosis."
"The difficulty in differentiating aggressive fibromatosis from well-differentiated fibrosarcoma is described, and is illustrated by a case report. Therapeutic possibilities are also discussed."
"Juvenile fibromatosis is a clinically aggressive but benign condition which does not commonly affect the jaws. Clinical and radiographic features are not specific, but diffuse lytic destruction of a portion of a jaw, especially the inferior border of the mandible, characterizes many cases. Histopathologic features are consistent and should be carefully observed to avoid a misdiagnosis of sarcoma. Three cases of juvenile fibromatosis affecting the jaws are reported; the patients were alive and well 9, 4, and 5 years, respectively, following therapy."
?
"For many years, pathologists have sought to create some order in the classification of non-metastasizing fibrous tissue disorders ranging from the benign keloid at one end of the scale to the ""non-metastasizing fibrosarcoma"" at the other. It is now generally accepted that these fibrous anomalies are members of the same family and the entire range from the most benign to the most bizarre is encompassed by the term ""fibromatosis"". Unfortunately, some of these lesions behave in a most aggressive manner and there appears to be little correlation between the histological appearance of the tumor and its clinical aggression. Some, particularly if occurring in the head and neck may pursue a relentless course and, defying all forms of therapy, result in death of the patient. Recently a young man presented with fibromatosis in the supraclavicular region. Despite a short history, the lesion was quite advanced and was considered surgically unresectable. Radiotherapy was thus considered to be the treatment of choice."
"A clinicopathologic study was made of 32 soft-tissue sarcomas of the anterior abdominal wall (ten desmoid tumors and 22 fully malignant sarcomas). Direct invasion of the costal margin or the iliac crest was observed in both types, whereas transperitoneal invasion and metastasis developed characteristically with fully malignant sarcomas. Wide monobloc resection of the abdominal wall, including, where necessary, resection of adjacent bony parts and reconstruction with a prosthetic mesh, satisfactorily controlled local disease in nine of ten patients with desmoid tumor, and in three of four patients with primary operable, fully malignant sarcoma. Adjunctive therapy with radiation and chemotherapy may improve the outcome in patients with recurrent or high-grade sarcomas, but adequate monobloc resection of the primary tumor remains the most important therapeutic objective."
"Administration of indomethacin caused complete resolution of a desmoid tumor after a partial response to radiation. In another patient, this drug caused an immediate response, then became ineffective. When large doses of ascorbic acid were given with indomethacin, slow resolution of the tumor began and has continued for 14 months. Treatment of a third case with indomethacin and ascorbic acid from the beginning produced shrinkage of the tumor which has continued to date."
"On the basis of examinations made in 16 patients, morphological and clinical aspects as well as aetiology and therapy of desmoid tumours are discussed. For the first time human lymphocyte antigens (HLA) were determined, pointing to a genetic predisposition. Guide-lines for the surgical management are established. Hormonal, cytostatic and irradiation therapy are evaluated."
"an aggressive infiltrative lesion with a proclivity for local recurrence following inadequate excision but without potential for distant metastasis. Clinically, it may simulate carcinoma; when suspected histologically during frozen section study, surgical resection should be limited to wide local excision and a definitive plan of therapy deferred until the lesion can be examined carefully with permanent sections."
?
"Extraabdominal desmoid tumors are nonencapsulated locally invasive neoplasms of fibrous tissue. The angiographic features include arterial stretching, neovascularity, and tumor staining (4 of 6 cases in this series). Although benign, these tumors are difficult to cure because they tend to recur locally."
"Desmoid tumor (aggressive fibromatosis) of the chest wall is rare and usually extrathoracic. A large extrapleural intrathoracic desmoid occurred at the site of previous thoracotomy, and recurred five years later."
"Juvenile fibromatosis is a benign lesion with locally aggressive characteristics. Wide surgical excision is the treatment of choice. Radiation therapy can be used for inoperable cases or as adjunctive therapy. Steroid therapy has not been used extensively and deserves further evaluation. In the head and neck area, juvenile fibromatosis must be very carefully diagnosed and treated due to the serious consequences that result from inadequate control."
?
This is a case report of a patient who had a desmoid tumor which localized 99mTc-diphosphonate. The mechanism for this localization was felt to be the affinity of the bone agent for the immature proliferating collagen in this tumor.
"A case of a desmoid tumor originally appeared as an orbital mass lesion in a 63-year-old woman. This is a most unusual location for this tumor and, to our knowledge, only one previous case of this type has been reported in the ophthalmic literature."
"Musculo-aponeurotic fibromatosis is an extremely rare lesion in the breast, only 16 previous cases having been reported. The unilateral tumor in our patient occurred after subcutaneous mastectomy and bilateral placement of implants. The histological evidence suggests that this tumor arose from the capsule surrounding one of the implants."
"Fibromatoses are uncommon, locally aggressive lesions that may involve the structures of the head and neck. They are most commonly found in and along the fascial planes of the neck muscles but can involve other structures, including the oral cavity, nose, nasopharynx or paranasal sinuses. An unusual case of an extra-abdominal desmoid tumor is presented and a review of the anatomical, clinical and pathological features of these tumors is discussed."
"Two cases of juvenile fibromatosis involving the mandible were found in children aged 1 1/2 and 2 1/2 years. The tumors, while histologically benign, were clinically aggressive, causing bone erosion and destruction and invading adjacent normal soft tissue structures with firm fibrous tumor extensions. In each instance, the lesion was completely removed by radical local surgery with no recurrence after a seven-year follow-up. The pertinent literature, consisting of six previously reported cases, has been reviewed."
?
"A case is presented with a child with a desmoid tumor of the pterygopalatine fossa in which approximately a third of the mandible including the condyle was removed for exposure. The trimmed mandibular segment was then returned to position with a fascia cap over the condyle and intermaxillary fixation was instituted. The graft was followed by serial roentgenogram over five years. The graft took completely, grew with the patient, and resulted in normal dental occlusion and normal mandibular excursion."
"Twenty-six cases of desmoid tumors of the wall of the chest were reviewed. These are rare lesions, which nonetheless should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all tumors of the chest wall. Although the lesion is most often palpable, several of the tumors were detectable only by means of an x-ray film of the thorax. Definitive diagnosis could not be made clinically but was easily established by pathologic examination of widely excised tumor. Like all desmoid tumors, these were locally aggressive in their growth but nonmetastatic and generally carried a good prognosis. Ideally, treatment consisted of wide local excision, but if there was encroachment of the tumor on vital structures, excision with suboptimal tumor-free margins was required. Even in the latter instance, tumefaction could be well controlled for long periods. Recurrences after an initial attempted removal were common, but most of these responded to reexcision."
"Two cases of rare desmoid fibromas are being reported, localised in the extremities. After a literature review of these tumors, the clinical characteristics are pointed out and difficulties in therapy discussed. The tumors occasionally appear on the forearm or the thigh of juvenile patients and show a similar development. In the first case, 7 operations with resection of the n. medianus and n. ulnaris were necessary to prevent a recurrence. In the second case, we saw a solitary and rapidly growing tumor, surrounding the sciatic nerve with a great tendency to recur."
"The value of computed tomography in the diagnosis and management of lesions of the musculoskeletal system is being determined. Illustrative cases including a lipoma of the thigh, osteochondroma of the hip, simple cyst of the ilium, recurrent liposarcoma of the lumbar spine, desmoid tumor in the gluteal region, and postoperative interspace infection of the lumbar spine are presented to indicate the potential value of this procedure in the diagnosis and planning of treatment of musculoskeletal lesions."

"A case of fibromatosis of the breast occurring in a 37-year-old woman is described. Only 15 cases of this type have been previously reported. In 5 of these cases there was also involvement of the underlying pectoral muscles, raising the possibility that some of these may have been of pectoral musculoaponeurotic origin. Two of the previously reported cases occurred in patients with Gardner's syndrome and 1 in a patient with ""familial muticentric fibromatosis."" It is anticipated that fibromatosis of the breast will behave in a similar fashion to fibromatosis occurring in other sites; i.e., as a local aggressive lesion which exhibits a high incidence of local recurrence following incomplete excision."
"Two cases of aggressive fibromatosis of the thyroid gland region were studied by histological, immunhistological and electron-microscopic methods. Contractile cells can be found in all tissue preparations using human serum containing antibodies to smooth muscle, especially in the periphery of the tumor. These cells have the characteristics of myofibroblasts by electron microscopy. The central areas of the tumor are composed of hyalin thickened bundles of collagen fibres with few cellular elements. The myofibroblast is thus considered to be the characteristic cell type of the tumor, and the pathogenesis and histogenesis of the lesion are discussed."
?
?
"A case of giant recurrent intra-abdominal desmoid tumor is presented. A history of childbirth, antecedent surgery, multiple episodes of recurrence, resistance to excisional and radiation therapy, represent common features of desmoid tumors. The size of the recurrence (15.4 kg), the intra-abdominal presentation of the tumor, involvement of the chest wall and focal infiltration of the small bowel are unusual features of this case."
?
Desmoid tumors are musculo-aponeurotic fibromatoses which most commonly occur in the abdominal wall. They do not metastasize but local recurrence is common. The treatment of choice is wide local excision of the mass and surrounding normal tissue. We have described a rare desmoid tumor which involved the abdominal wall as well as small and large bowel. En bloc intestinal resections were required for complete tumor extirpation.
"Angiography was done in 38 cases of pathologically-confirmed fibrous-tissue tumor. All benign fibromatous tumors and one case of desmoid fibroma were angiographically normal. A great spectrum of angioarchitecture exists in fibrosarcomas, whether they are of bone or soft-tissue origin. Heterogeneous vascularity was seen in 55% of these cases, and was related to the cell composition of the tumor. There exists a close relationship between the number of vessels in a tumor and its degree of clinical and histopathological malignancy. The most vascular part of a tumor is the least differentiated and should be used for biopsies. Angiography can be used for the grading of fibrosarcomas, and probably for assessing clinical prognosis."
"Desmoid tumors are locally invasive benign tumors arising from musculoaponeurotic structures which are classified as fibromatoses and which have generally high post-surgical recurrence rates. Sixteen patients with desmoid tumors were treated with irradiation and evaluated for 2 to 6 years post-treatment. Of the 16, 13 cases have been controlled without recurrence. Virtually complete resolution of the tumor mass has been accomplished without the disfigurement and dysfunction characteristic of the radical surgical approach to treatment."
"A case of desmoid tumor of the anterior chest and abdominal wall is presented. The entire body of the sternum along with the upper abdominal wall and inner parts of both breasts was resected. The resulting defect over the pericardium and abdomen was reconstructed by the omentum and Marlex mesh. The large skin defect was covered by bilateral thoracoabdominal tube pedicles. The patient had a stable chest wall with uncompromised respiratory function 1 week after the operation. Prevention of local recurrences of desmoid tumors requires wide excision of the involved soft tissues and bony structures. The principles of wide resection of soft tissue tumors, reconstruction of the anterior chest and abdominal wall defects, and planning the skin coverage over the resulting defect are discussed."
?
"Aggressive juvenile fibromatosis involving the facial bones is rare, difficult to diagnose clinically, histologically confusing, and requires aggressive surgical treatment. Only four cases involving the mandible have been previously reported. A review of the literature is presented here in conjunction with a case report of this rare tumor."
"A case of a desmoid tumor is presented. The tumour was initially found in an appendectomy scar. Excision of the tumour was not radical enough and it recurred. During the second operation, a tumour weighing 940 g was excised. A segment of the right ureter and right iliac vessels were also resected and reconstructed. Recovery was uneventful. Moderate swelling due to lymphoedema in the right lower extremity persisted after the second operation. There has been no recurrence after the second operation eight years ago."
"When an aggressive tumor develops in a flat muscle near the thoracic cage the question may arise as to how achieve an adequate margin on the deep side of the tumor. This is especially the case if the tumor has recurred after a previous non-radical operation. A method is described by which the external thoracic fascia, the external intercostal musculature, and the periosteum on the external surface of the ribs can be included in the specimen as a continuous wall of healthy tissue on the deep side of the tumor. This technique has been used in 11 patients, 9 of whom had undergone one or more inadequate operations earlier. Eight patients had a malignant tumor, three an extra-abdominal desmoid. In one of the latter patients, in whom a recurrent tumor was adherent to rib periosteum, the method was unsuitable. In the other patients the method appears to have been adequate for local control of the tumor."
?
"In a study of 256 nonepithelial neoplasms involving the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, and nasopharynx, 23 lesions were classified as fibrous tissue tumors, including four cases of ""fibroma"", six of fibromatosis, and thirteen of fibrosarcoma. The clinical findings associated with these lesions are described, their histologic features illustrated, results of therapy presented and clinicopathologic correlations made. The ""fibromas"" presented a small localized nodules. None recurred after local excision. Fibromatosis, a locally aggressive tumor, does not metastasize, but may cause considerable morbidity or even death due to local infiltration which may be difficult to control surgically. Fibrosarcoma may cause death either by local infiltration or by metastasis, but has a better prognosis than most other sarcomas of this region. We recommend that a large en block resection be performed initially for fibromatosis and fibrosarcoma growing in this area, after the diagnosis has been made by biopsy. In this series, including patients who had more than one operation, recurrent tumor was seen following 10 of 12 limited local excisions performed for fibromatosis and fibrosarcoma, but in only one of 13 patients after a large bloc resection. The problems involved in histologically differentiating fibrous tissue tumors from other lesions are discussed. A patient with the rare syndrome of multicentric fibromatosis with spontaneous regression of lesions is presented."
A case is reported of an extra-abdominal desmoid tumor presenting as an axillary tail breast mass. This represents the third reported case and the first description of the roentgenographic findings of this entity. That this tumor can be confused with carcinoma of the breast is emphasized.
"1. Inadequate excision of desmoid tumors results in local recurrence. 2. Adequate excision of desmoid tumors ot the abdominal wall sometimes necessitates creation of an abdominal wall defect too large for primary closure. 3. Marlex mesh has been used successfully in reconstruction of the abdominal wall following adequate excision of desmoid tumors. 4. One patient (Case 4) with an abdominal wall desmoid tumor associated with familial polypisis and mesenteric fibromatosis has benefited greatly following wide excision of abdominal wall and reconstriction using Marlex mesh, despite the fact that the mesenteric fibrous tumor was unresectable."
?
"Abdominal masses, ""desmoid tumors,"" occur in approximately 4% of patients with Gardner's Syndrome, usually 1--3 years after total colectomy. Histologic sections usually resemble those of an infiltrating fibrous tumour, a desmoid lesion. The radiographic pattern may be similar to any diffuse abdominal retroperitoneal tumor, metastatic disease, lymphoma, or possibly retractile mesenteritis. The clinical setting usually differentiates these entities."
A case of desmoid tumor of 17 years' duration associated with cystosarcoma phyllodes of 17 months' duration is presented. Good initial response to radiation therapy of the desmoid tumor was shown. Poor response of cytosarcoma phyllodes to radiation therapy was noted. A comparison between the similarities and differences of the two tumors is presented.
"A 26-year-old woman developed a desmoid tumor of the lower abdominal wall shortly after the birth of her fourth child. It measured 15 by 17 cm. and involved most of the lower abdominal wall of this small-framed woman. Operative removal would have been mutilating and almost surely doomed to failure. No treatment was given. Over a 5 year period, the tumor regressed and has disappeared almost completely. It was and has remained entirely asymptomatic. Desmoid tumors of the abdominal wall never metastasize, are asymptomatic, and may regress spontaneously. Since surgical treatment so often fails, it is felt that extensive or mutilating operations are not justified."
"In the study presented here the ultrastructural cellular features of three desmoids and four well-differentiated fibrosarcomas were compared. Electron microscopically, the tumors were almost identical relative to qualitative traits. The majority of cells corresponded to fibroblast-like cells with certain morphological variations. Especially cells with characteristics of myofibroblasts must be emphasized, whereas cells with an organelle composition of classical fibroblasts were surprisingly seldom. Considering the relations of cells to each other and to vessels the prevailing origin of tumor cells from preexisting fibroblasts is suggested."
"fibromatosis, fasciitis and myositis; histiocytic: giant-cell tumor of tendon sheath, fibrous histiocytoma and atypical fibroxanthoma), metaplastic (ossifying fasciitis, ossifying myositis and juvenile chondroid fibroma) and hamartomatous nature (fibrous hamartoma). It must be emphasized that these lesions show a variable and polymorphouse cellular composition and then can simulate sarcoma."
"-tumefaction and trismus in usually very young subjects; -the radiological picture is that of lysis with relatively well defined limits, but with no double outline, with possible cortical rupture and aberrant lacunae far from the main focus which explains possible recurrences of this tumor which is nevertheless benign. The main histological danger is confusion with a differenciated fibrosarcoma. Mandibular resection which is frequently necessary should ensure stable recovery."

"Fifteen patients with surgically incurable, advanced, and metastatic sarcomas were treated with courses of adriamycin and vincristine-actinomycin D alternating within a 7-week cycle. Three patients had objective partial responses for more than 3 months (liposarcoma, 4 months; fibrous histiocytoma, 15+ months; desmoid tumor, 19+ months) while two other patients (liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma) had lesser responses. No beneficial effect could be attributed to therapy in two patients with leiomyosarcoma, two patients each with synovial cell sarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and chondrosarcoma, and one patient each with rhabdomyosarcoma and mesenchymoma. No additive effect of alternating full doses of these agents could be demonstrated over the published data on response to adriamycin or actinomycin D alone."

"A female patient with Gardner's syndrome was treated with delta1-testololactone (200 mg daily) because of growth of a large desmoid tumor in the pelvis and lower abdomen and a tumor in a scar from a previous laparotomy. There was also pain and swelling of the left leg. An immediate effect of the drug therapy was complete relief of pain followed shortly thereafter by disappearance of the edema of the leg. After two months, the numerous sebaceous cysts were less prominent. The gross measurements of the diameter of the pelvic and lower abdominal tumor clearly demonstrated tumor shrinkage following therapy. Small polyps scattered over the rectal mucosa and numerous osteomata were not demonstrably affected. After one year of treatment with delta1-testololactone, a laparotomy for partial small bowel obstruction was necessary. Obstruction was caused by the involvement of small bowel mesentery and the bowel itself in a contracted residuum of dense fibrous tissue. Substitution of theophylline and chlorothiazide for the testololactone in Januray 1974 was followed by further diminution of the measurable abdominal and pelvic desmoids. All of these compounds synergize the action of 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate and at least the latter two may function by inhibiting the action of 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate diesterase."
